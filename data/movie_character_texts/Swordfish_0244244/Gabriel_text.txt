1) 1) dialog: Take Dog Day Afternoon for example. Arguably Pacino's greatest performance, excepting The Godfather, Part I, and Scarface, of course. A masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet's best. The acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. But, they didn't push the envelope. What if in Dog Day, Sonny really wanted to get away with it? What if, and here's where it gets tricky. What if they'd started killing hostages? No mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter. What? Still no bus?
1) 6) dialog: How many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations? And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet. Fast forward to the present, same situation. Can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? In hours it would be the top story from Boston to Budapest. All caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected. You would practically taste the brain matter. Six hostages die. Ten. Twelve. Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One after another. All over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured. He sits, letting the pictures sink in, then:
1) 7) dialog: Just a thought. I mean it's not really within the realm of conventional cinema, but what if...?
1) 9) dialog: Really?   How come?
1) 12) dialog: Pacino escapes. With the money. Boyfriend gets the sex change operation. They live happily ever after. Stanley shakes his head.
1) 13) dialog: No?
1) 18) dialog: Homophobia? Stanley shakes his head.
1) 20) dialog: Oh, well. Life does tend to be stranger than fiction. (looking at watch)
1) 22) dialog: 
1) 23) dialog: Thanks for the coffee. He gets up. In his left hand, which has been hidden by the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking spring-loaded grip. Gabriel is looking back at them. Smiles.
1) 24) dialog: Rene Descartes is sitting in some bar in Paris. Bartender says, 'Hey, you want another drink?' Descartes says, 'I think not.' And disappears. He smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to the front door.
1) 25) dialog: Move. No one even twitches.
1) 26) dialog: I won't ask again.
1) 31) dialog: Thank you. Gabriel looks back at Stan sitting in the booth.
1) 32) dialog: Stanley... you coming? Stan slides from the booth as Gabriel exits the coffee shop --
2) 0) text: SILENCE -- no sounds on the SOUNDTRACK. Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway. Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues across the sidewalk and into the street. He nonchalantly looks up. Suddenly the THUMP of HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the soundtrack. Pandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and a bunch of news vultures. Squad cars block off both ends of the street while SWAT trucks, news vans, and looky- loos are packed together into the distance. Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are positioned on every open rooftop. Hundreds of weapons are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in the world. Slowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street. Gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus blocks most of the windows. He walks beside the bus, under a huge "WORLD BANC" sign, and through the glass front door, which shuts IN OUR FACE.
3) 0) dialog: He turns away from the window and we FOLLOW him.
3) 4) dialog: How we doin'? One of the ARMED MEN finishes putting a collar on a young, normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara, whimpering blonde girl.
3) 6) dialog: Good.   Take her out. SUPERIMPOSE:    FRIDAY, OCTOBER 18     8:41:22... The front door opens and one of the suited men drags out the pretty blonde from earlier. She is sobbing and is in such grief she can't even walk.
5) 0) text: Gabriel grabs his cell and dials.
6) 15) dialog: Don't talk, listen... When I made my Dog Day Afternoon analogy, I was not speaking metaphorically. We have 22 hostages. Each has been wrapped with 20 pounds of C-four explosives.
7) 1) dialog: On top of that we have taped 15 pounds of stainless steel ball bearings --
8) 0) dialog: 
8) 1) dialog: -- making them the world's largest walking Claymore mines.
9) 0) text: aiming down at Gabriel's merc. The merc is holding up the weeping girl so everyone can see what Gabriel is talking about. Unbeknownst to him, red laser aiming dots appear on Gab's merc's chest.
10) 1) dialog: 
10) 2) dialog: Around her neck is a radio- frequency electronic dog collar --
12) 1) dialog: Dog walks out of his yard, he gets the shit shocked out of him.

14) 0) dialog: 
14) 1) dialog: -- their yard is this bank.      So, don't fuck with me.
35) 0) text: Two FBI agents (BAD AGENTS #1 &amp; 2) watch the interrogation through a two-way mirror. One of the agents looks surprisingly like Gabriel's merc that carried the young blonde girl killed outside the bank earlier.
37) 0) text: A yellow Lamborghini Diablo drives up. In SLOW MOTION Gabriel steps out of the car, wind whipping his full- length, black Gucci overcoat.
39) 0) text: Gabriel walks through the crowd as if a celebrity --
42) 0) text: Upstairs on a lavish balcony Gabriel looks at the crowd.
42) 2) dialog: smiling.
55) 8) text: They walk into one of the booths in the back. Sitting around a large, oval table is our antihero, Gabriel Shear, surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle of beautiful model-types. Ginger kisses Gabriel and with a healthy exchange of fluids, then...
55) 10) text: Gabriel smiles, then looks back at Stanley.
55) 12) text: Gabriel just stares.
55) 13) dialog: (very familiar) Big Stan. Nice suit.
55) 15) dialog: You know, they say it's the clothes that make the man...
55) 17) dialog: Hope not. (then) Buy you a drink?
55) 22) dialog: Actually you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand. But that's not the point.
55) 23) text: Stanley sits down.    Gabriel pours Stan a glass of Crown
55) 24) dialog: I heard this story about this young hacker who made a virus that broke the F.B.I.'s Carnivore program that was actively reading every subscriber's E-mail and scrambled the systems. He did what the federal judges wouldn't do and kept the government out of our Privacy.
55) 27) dialog: Stanley, meet Helga.
55) 28) text: Gabriel smiles. The beautiful WOMAN to Stanley's right slides closer.
55) 30) text: Stanley looks at her, she's a knockout; artificially perfect. He looks back at Gabriel.
55) 32) dialog: Stanley, we have a problem, maybe you can help us out.
55) 36) dialog: Take a look at this.
55) 42) dialog: No need for modesty, we're all friends here, Stanley.
55) 44) dialog: You want something from me, amigo, I want something from you. D.O.D. dBase, 128 bit R.S.A. encryption. Whattaya think? Impossible?
55) 45) text: Stanley's having a little trouble concentrating on Gabriel.
55) 48) dialog: So it can be done? Maybe slide in a Trojan horse hiding a worm?
55) 53) dialog: Sort of. Marco, let's give him some incentive.
55) 54) text: The drapes close. Two of Gabriel's crew step out. Marco yanks out a .40 caliber Glock and quickly screws a well- used silencer onto the end. Marco walks around behind Stanley.
55) 57) dialog: Relax, Stanley.
55) 59) dialog: I've been told the best crackers in the world could do this in sixty minutes. Unfortunately, I need someone who can do it in sixty seconds.
55) 61) dialog: 'Fraid not.
55) 63) dialog: Forty-five seconds. Time is a wasting, big guy.
55) 65) dialog: You have thirty seconds, Stanley.
55) 70) dialog: She's very good, isn't she, Stanley?
55) 73) dialog: C'mon, Stanley. 20 seconds.
55) 75) dialog: Fifteen.
55) 77) dialog: Ten... Nine...
55) 79) dialog: Three... Two...
55) 82) dialog: Too bad, Stanley. Ya gotta die.
55) 85) text: CLICK. The GUN is empty. Stanley tries to catch his breath. Helga lifts up her head. Everyone laughs. Gabriel walks around the table.
55) 89) dialog: I was just fucking with you, Stan.
55) 95) dialog: who smiles.
57) 0) text: Next to the valet stand, Gabriel leans over the hood of an evil-looking, bright-yellow Lamborghini Diablo Roadster, a GAMEBOY CHIRPING in his hands. Stanley walks INTO the FRAME.          Without missing a Gabriel looks up --
57) 1) dialog: Big Stan.   I was afraid we lost you.
57) 2) text: Gabriel stands up and walks toward Stan.
57) 7) dialog: Let's go up to the house. I'm having a little get-together. I'll explain it to you there.
57) 8) text: Gabriel smiles.
59) 0) text: The house is at the very top of the hills and the pool hangs off the side of the cliff, way below the house. The outer edge appears nonexistent, like the water hangs frozen in air. A very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress.    More Ibiza than Hollywood Hills. Stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half- dozen beautiful un-clad model-types. Gabriel is mingling through the crowd.
59) 2) dialog: (smiles)
59) 5) dialog: Break the code. At the club. You broke the entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in someone's mouth, all in less than sixty seconds. How?
59) 8) dialog: C'mon, you can do better than that. How'd you do it?
59) 15) dialog: C'mon, Stanley. How'd-you-do-it?
59) 19) dialog: (drinking wine) You definitely have a gift, Stan. The most powerful people on the planet are like you. With a laptop and a phone line you can make God look like a thirteen-year-old with a stack of Playboys and a lack of imagination. (beat) C'mere, Stan, let me show you something.
60) 0) text: Stanley and Gabriel stand in Gabriel's primo designed pad, staring at an array of supercomputers. Stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels, linked together, in complete awe.
60) 1) dialog: Pretty impressive, huh. (beat) So...
60) 6) dialog: Here's the deal. I need a worm, Stanley. A hydra, actually. A multi-headed worm to break an encryption and then sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network.
60) 8) dialog: Vernam encryption.
60) 10) dialog: Actually, we're talking 512 bit.
60) 12) dialog: Tell ya what, I'll pay you ten million dollars. That should be enough to get your daughter back... (beat) ... unless of course it's impossible.
60) 15) text: They shake hands and Gabriel heads toward the back of the house.
60) 16) dialog: walking up the stairs toward his room. Stan looks over to see Ginger staring at him.
71) 2) text: Ginger grabs her Glock and spins around, the holster dropping away with the touch of a button. She levels it on the dark corner of the room where Stanley sits waiting, drinking a bottle of Gabriel's expensive wine.
72) 0) text: Gabriel walking down hallway.
74) 0) dialog: nearing Ginger's room.
75) 3) dialog: Ginger...?
75) 4) text: Stanley, in one quick thinking movement, rips the wire from Ginger's chest and flings it behind the bed just as the door swings open. Gabriel stands staring at them. Ginger topless, weapon in hand and Stanley who looks like he had the shit kicked out of him. Ginger and Stanley both stare at him.
75) 5) dialog: Well, Ging, doesn't this look friendly.
75) 12) text: Ginger stares at Stanley, who turns to look at Gabriel. Gabriel looks at Stan, waiting.
75) 14) dialog: Get?
75) 19) text: Gabriel walks into the hall. Stanley looks back at Ginger who mouths the words "Thank you." Stanley ignores her. Ginger reaches down and grabs a shirt off the bed.
75) 20) dialog: You look like shit. Ginger kick your ass?
76) 0) text: Stanley, looking a little rough, sits in front of the huge array of flat-panels. He works quickly. The nitrogen system, an array of hoses winding across the living room floor, intermittently SHOOTS JETS of GAS upwards, dropping the temperature to a livable 85 degrees. Gabriel sits next to Stan. Ginger walks in.      She stands behind Stan as he works.
77) 14) dialog: Yes he is.
77) 18) dialog: I see you have a groupie.
77) 20) text: PUSH IN ON Gabriel as he thinks about it.
78) 1) dialog: Have you heard of Operation Swordfish?
79) 1) dialog: You'll appreciate the irony here --
79) 2) text: Gabriel gets out of the car, still talking.       Stanley follows.
79) 3) dialog: -- In the early Eighties the D.E.A. set up a network of dummy corporations as a government front to launder drug money and gather evidence. Problem is, the front companies started making money. Lots of money. By 1986, when Operation Swordfish was terminated, there was close to 400 million dollars in the D.E.A.'s accounts.
80) 0) text: Gabriel and Stanley walk through the door and sit down at a window table.
80) 5) dialog: It didn't disappear. It just sat in those accounts earning interest, it's been 15 years. You have any concept how much money we'd be actually talking about today? Billions, brother. That's nine zeros. (beat) Look, this is a sweet deal. We go in over phone lines. Pop the firewall, drop in the hydra, and just sit back and wait for the money.
80) 7) dialog: No problem. (beat) Look behind you, Stan.
81) 0) text: Gabriel and Stanley walk toward the house. The CAMERA PANS LEFT and we can now see Gabriel's house, poolside. We PULL BACK, THROUGH a window INTO:
82) 0) text: A small trailer across the canyon from Gabriel's house.
84) 1) text: Gabriel stands by the pool, his BACK TOWARD US. Slowly, Gabriel turns around. He is staring directly AT US.
88) 0) text: Gabriel and Marco sit at the same type of apparatus, a merc at the laptop. Reisman's dialogue comes out of the SPEAKER, but it is no longer Reisman, it is a COMPUTERIZED VOICE.
88) 5) dialog: I'm not exactly following you.
90) 0) text: Gabriel looks at the surveillance photos as they come up. We INTERCUT as they speak.
90) 1) dialog: (irritated but respectful) Senator, I sincerely hope you did not contact me and jeopardize the safety of me and my men for this.
90) 3) dialog: Sir, with all due respect. Do you think there is any aspect of this operation I am not fully aware of?
90) 5) dialog: What?
90) 7) dialog: A vacation?   Have I ever failed you, sir?
90) 12) dialog: It's my point. Senator, this operation is going forward.
90) 14) dialog: Everything is under control.
94) 4) text: Gabriel's body is wedged into the 32-degree white wine cooler.
95) 0) text: Stanley runs around the corner. Gabriel is standing in the doorway, directly in front of Stanley. Stan damn near falls down.
95) 1) dialog: Stan? Stan can't say a word.
95) 5) dialog: What's wrong, Stanley, you look like you've seen a ghost?
95) 6) text: Gabriel looks in and sees the empty wine bottle at the computer station.
95) 7) dialog: C'mon, Stanley. Let's talk.
95) 9) dialog: Let's go.
95) 11) dialog: 'Cause I don't want to talk to you in the house, Stanley.
95) 12) text: Gabriel walks out.       Stanley slowly follows.
95) 13) dialog: Let's go.
96) 1) dialog: How you doing, Stanley?
96) 3) dialog: Something you need to say to me?
96) 5) dialog: (totally cool) You know anything about Harry Houdini?
96) 10) dialog: He used to make an elephant disappear in a theater full of people. You know how he did it?
96) 11) text: Gabriel unwraps a piece of gum --
96) 14) dialog: Misdirection.
96) 15) text: Gabriel whips right down a side street and drops the hammer. He blows through a stop sign, then another. CARS CRASH. He is calm, cool, but continues to glance in his rearview mirror.
96) 17) dialog: We have a tail. (beat) Hope you had a light lunch, Stan.
96) 18) text: Gabriel slides left into an alley, gets it under control and SCREAMS toward the other side. A black Suburban pulls up, closing off the alley. He slides to a stop and slams it into reverse. Backwards at 60-plus miles per hour.
96) 19) dialog: Hold the wheel.
96) 20) text: Gabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up a duffel bag. He unzips it, and withdraws what the Marines call a SAW -- a Belgian-designed machine gun, compact but with 1500 rounds of Swiss cheese action per minute, powerful enough for the U.S. to replace the M-60.
96) 22) text: Gabriel looks behind them, another black Suburban has blocked them in. The one from the other side and a third comes toward them down the alley.
96) 23) dialog: Keep it straight.
96) 27) dialog: It's just rough when you grow up lovin' James Bond movies. Don't worry, Stanley, it'll be over soon.
96) 29) dialog: Drive, drive!
96) 30) text: Stanley slides under Gabriel as Gabriel steps into the passenger side. The wheels spin, the Lambo is wedged under the Suburban.
96) 31) dialog: Go, go!
96) 32) text: Gabriel continues to BLAST FULL-AUTO, tearing the Suburban to shrapnel.
96) 34) text: Finally the mortally wounded but still kicking Lamborghini tears free of the Suburban and rockets head- toward the other. Stanley drives like a maniac. Gabriel RIPS it on FULL-AUTO, meatloafing the driver. The Suburban veers into the wall. Smack. Stanley whips beside it and Gabriel STRAFES down the side, opening it up. Stan whips right onto a main street.
96) 39) dialog: (changing out a clip) Keep your cool, Stanley.
96) 40) text: The Lambo rolls to a stop and Gabriel hops out, running at the Suburbans. After a moment of all-out GI Joe-style blitzkrieg, it's over. Gabriel walks to a body lying in the street.    He turns over the body and looks at the face.
96) 41) dialog: Goddamit.   I knew it.
96) 42) text: Gabriel walks back to one of the burning Suburbans where Stanley stands.
96) 43) dialog: Get in the fucking car, Stanley.
96) 45) text: Gabriel pulls out his H&amp;K, points it at Stanley.
96) 46) dialog: You're on my good side and you want to stay there. Stanley, I like you, but don't confuse kindness with weakness. So, get in the fuckin' car. I need my hydra.
98) 7) text: as Gabriel steps out and walks TOWARD us.     The copter lifts off behind him.
98) 9) dialog: (sniffing in air) Ahh, the great American outdoors. I'll never understand the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too much like masturbation for me, without the payoff.
98) 10) text: Gabriel looks around, suddenly realizing something.
98) 11) dialog: This's a catch-and-release stream, isn't it?
98) 13) text: Gabriel starts to laugh.      Reisman doesn't catch the j
98) 14) dialog: Oh c'mon, Jim. You gotta see the irony in the chairman of the Joint Sub-Committee on Crime, fishing in a catch-and-release stream.
98) 20) dialog: How could you do it, Jim? After all we have sacrificed. All the blood, all the death... I've changed my identity so many times, I don't even know what I look like anymore. How could you turn on me when we are so close?
98) 22) dialog: You brought me in to get the job done and you didn't want to know about the consequences.
98) 24) dialog: I told you there was nothing that I was unaware of --
98) 26) dialog: You have misplaced your loyalties, Senator. You have sold America out. I am a patriot, and patriotism does not have a four-year shelf life. Unfortunately, politicians do.
98) 27) text: Gabriel pulls out his H&amp;K, dangling it by his side.
98) 29) dialog: Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the White House lawn for treason, Senator. You tried to execute me in the name of politics, now I execute you in the name of the people.
98) 30) text: Gabriel shoots Reisman in the chest.     He falls into th water.
101) 0) text: A snazzy, sweat-suited Kaplan walks out to his shiny new silver Porsche, racquet ball racquet flipping in hand. He's so downright happy in his confidence that he is on the fast track to political Valhalla, due to his handling of this Gabriel Shear debacle, he is whistling. He CLICKS the Porsche key, unlocking the driver's door, tosses in his racquet and climbs in.
104) 0) text: Stanley is getting out of Marco's car.    Gabriel walks o of the theater back door.
104) 1) dialog: (over shoulder)
104) 4) dialog: Stan, how are you?
104) 6) dialog: Have you finished? Stan pulls out the zip disk and hands it to Gabriel who dials his cell phone.
104) 7) dialog: Here.
104) 18) text: Stan looks at Gabriel who smiles.
104) 19) dialog: Just like I promised, Stanley.
104) 21) dialog: Soon, Stanley.     Walk with me.
105) 1) dialog: I'm about to do something against my better judgement. I'm going to tell you something I never tell anyone. I'm going to tell you who I am.
105) 3) dialog: Do you?    You think I'm a bank robber.    Really, I'm just like you.
105) 5) dialog: That I am. And worse. Much worse. I am forced to operate on a different plane than you. But, I have ethics. Rules to which I must adhere.
105) 10) dialog: 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to Madison because he was concerned that the freedoms of the constitution would be ignored.
105) 12) dialog: Listen to me and you will. In the 1950s, armed with this letter, J. Edgar Hoover created an organization to protect the freedoms of this country at all costs.
105) 14) dialog: I'm talking about your daughter.
105) 16) dialog: Yes. You, your daughter and 200 million other Americans who take their freedoms for granted. You don't understand what it takes to protect those freedoms. That's my job, Stanley, to protect your way of life at all costs.
105) 18) dialog: That's right, Stanley --
105) 20) dialog: -- 'cause wars cost money.
106) 0) text: Stan inside. It's as if he's just teleported into Beirut. Weapons, Hummers, a huge armored bus is jacked up at one end of the theatre. Gabriel's men go about readying themselves. One of the mercs walks over to Gabriel to show a modified electronic dog collar.
106) 2) dialog: That's what I'm telling you, Stanley. We are at war.
106) 4) dialog: Anyone who infringes on America's freedom. Terrorists' states, Stanley. Someone must take their war to them. They bomb a church, we bomb ten. They hijack a plane, we take out an airport. They execute American tourists, we tactically nuke an entire city. We must make terrorism so horrific that it becomes unthinkable to attack Americans.
106) 6) dialog: Maybe. I wanted you to do this because you wanted to, because we need men like you, but our time table's been moved up. Just relax and it will all be over in twenty-four hours. You're rich, Stanley. Pretty soon Holly and you will be basking in the sun on the deck of some eighty-foot scarab, eating bon bons and living the good life.
106) 11) dialog: (to himself) Pretty slick.
106) 13) dialog: No. He'll be back. We gotta move. Load up.

119) 1) dialog: Get that son-of-a-bitch on the phone. Gabriel walks towards the window, slinging his FN-FAL, and pulling on his headset. A.D. Joy answers.
119) 2) dialog: If you need to test my resolve then God help you. You have 25 minutes. That plane better be on the runway. He clicks off.    He turns to Stan.
119) 3) dialog: Get my money, Stanley.
119) 11) text: Stanley's heart almost stops.    He sighs as Gabriel toss him the giraffe.
119) 12) dialog: Do you really think I wanted it to come to this. Do you? I am not a psychopath, Stanley, but I told you, I will sacrifice as many lives as it takes to protect our country, including my own. (beat) Now get me my money.
119) 14) dialog: Both of you. You have my word, Stanley. C'mon.
120) 1) dialog: We okay?
122) 4) text: Gabriel looks at the lights as they flicker back on, the huge portable GENERATOR springing to life.
122) 5) dialog: They just cut the power. Forget it. How long to transfer the money?
122) 7) dialog: National Bank of Zurich. Spread it evenly over these accounts. It won't be there that long.
122) 12) dialog: Good job, Stanley, I got someone who wants to see you.
122) 17) text: Holly nods yes. Stanley and Holly are escorted toward the door. Gabriel stands in front, holding his FN-FAL. He is speaking in French to several of the mercs.
122) 18) dialog: Hold up.
122) 19) text: Stanley stops. Gabriel walks down the steps and unhooks Holly's collar. Stan is about to freak.

122) 28) dialog: What?
122) 33) text: Gabriel turns around to look at Stanley.    We ZOOM INTO CLOSEUP. He's pissed.

124) 10) text: Marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the Hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30- foot-high ceiling buttresses. Gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his throat.
124) 11) dialog: Marco!   Grab Agent Sculley!
124) 12) text: Marco grabs Ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over to where Gabriel stands, brandishing the cable.
124) 14) text: Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. Gabriel hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it over Ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. He cuts the cable-tie loose. She digs at them with her fingers. Two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his throat. Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow.
124) 18) dialog: In all reality, Stan, she has you to thank for this. That first night in Prague you broke the D.O.D. database that contained her true identity. She's D.E.A., Stan, but without you, I never would have known.
124) 20) dialog: String up the D.E.A. bitch.
124) 23) dialog: Then get me my money, Stan.
124) 26) dialog: Okay.
124) 27) text: Gabriel yanks out his .40 cal. H&amp;K, turns and SHOOTS hanging Ginger.
124) 29) text: Stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her. He looks up at Gabriel and runs at him. Gabriel slaps him in the throat, spinning him, and grabs Stan around the neck in the crook of his arm.
124) 33) dialog: (close and very serious) Take a moment, big guy. Don't make me put you in a wheelchair.
124) 36) dialog: I didn't Stan, you did.    But we're not done yet. (to Marco) Marco...
124) 38) dialog: There are a lot of hostages here. I cared about Ginger, can you imagine what I could do to someone I don't care about. How long before the money jumps?
124) 40) dialog: They better hope you installed a back door or it could be a long day. Somebody get me a laptop.
124) 41) text: A laptop appears. Gabriel hands it to Stanley and nods to the mercs who drop him. Stanley drops to his knees, placing the computer on the ground. Stanley has logged onto the net via modem and we hear that familiar PULSE as he does. He connects onto an encrypted site on the net. His fingers hum over the keys.
124) 43) dialog: (looking at his watch) Okay, Stan. Sixty seconds.
124) 47) dialog: Forty-five seconds, Stanley.
124) 50) dialog: Twenty seconds, Stan.
124) 52) dialog: Fifteen.   She's gonna die, Stanley.
124) 57) dialog: Ten.
124) 59) dialog: Nine... Eight... Seven.
124) 63) dialog: Four, three, two...
124) 67) dialog: One.
124) 69) text: Stanley jumps up and runs over to Marco.        Gabriel p his gun to the back of Stanley's head.
124) 71) text: Gabriel looks at one of his boys who is checking it with a different laptop. He nods. Marco drops the girl.
124) 72) dialog: Well, that was fun.
124) 75) dialog: Well, 'bout time for us to leave.
124) 77) dialog: Au contraire. Do you hear that? (beat) That's the sound of America watching.
126) 1) dialog: (to the driver) Let's roll.
132) 0) text: Gabriel's voice booms from speakers on the exterior of the bus.
132) 1) dialog: I don't think any of us want a repeat of this morning. Keep at least a hundred yards from this bus at all times and I want the airspace for five miles clear.
133) 1) dialog: (dropping the mic and turning to the hostages)
133) 2) text: Ladies and gentlemen, we will be in your lives for approximately 55 more minutes. This bus has just become your new yard. So sit back, think happy thoughts, and this will be over before you can say 'cat in the hat.' Gabriel, smiling, turns to Stanley.
133) 3) dialog: Whaddaya think, Stanley?
133) 5) dialog: Really? Five hundred bucks says I do. Tell ya what, Stanley, I'll even spot you the five bills. Gabriel walks to the front of the bus, puts on a headset, and keys a mic.
134) 1) dialog: Stan, c'mere. Stan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with Gabriel. All the hostages' eyes are on him. At the front he looks at Gabriel.
134) 2) dialog: Take a look. Cops block off side streets as the convoy, ala The Gauntlet, rolls through L.A. Gabriel seems to be in complete control, despite being surrounded by every law enforcement officer within a hundred miles.
135) 0) text: Stan turns to Gabriel, angry.   He grabs him, pushing him
135) 2) dialog: You're not looking at the big picture. Gabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail.
135) 3) dialog: Stanley, here's a scenario. You have the power to cure all of the world's diseases. But the price for this is that you must kill a single, innocent child. Could you kill that child to save the world?
135) 5) dialog: You disappoint me, Stanley.   It's the greatest good. Silence for several beats.
135) 10) dialog: Now you're getting it.   How about a hundred?
135) 11) text: Gabriel becomes intense.
135) 12) dialog: How about a thousand? Not to save the world, but just to preserve our way of life.
135) 14) dialog: You're wrong, Stanley. Some men are put here to shape destiny, to protect freedom, despite the atrocities they must commit. I am one of those men. Thousands die every day for no reason at all, where is your bleeding heart for them? You give your twenty dollars to Greenpeace every year and think you are changing the world. What countries will harbor terrorists, when they realize the consequences of what I will do? Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for forty million each? I buy half a dozen, I even get a discount.
135) 15) text: The driver, looking at his watch, says something to Gabriel in French. Gabriel replies to the driver, also in French.
135) 23) dialog: I saw Sugarland Express, Stan. Didn't like the way it ended.
136) 2) dialog: Misdirection, Stanley.
136) 5) text: One of the mercs in the front speaks French again. Gabriel looks around. He smiles.
136) 6) dialog: Listen...
136) 8) dialog: Gentlemen...
139) 1) dialog: Hold on.
142) 0) text: The SWAT teams sit and just continue to wait for Gabriel, who will never show up.
144) 1) dialog: (laughing)
144) 2) text: The only way to fly, huh, Stanley. Gabriel says something in French into the radio.
148) 1) dialog: Bank right!
157) 0) text: Gabriel turns to the merc driving the bus, who is wearing a headset.
157) 1) dialog: We okay?
167) 0) text: Sitting there on a helipad is an evil-looking, matte- black, Explorer helicopter. Gabriel and his men walk off the bus toward the waiting helicopter. Gabriel turns back to Stanley who is standing on the stairs of the bus. We hear the sound of hundreds of SIRENS APPROACHING.
167) 1) dialog: Well, Stanley, gotta fly. Take care of that little girl. Maybe I'll see you again one day.
167) 6) dialog: C'mon, Stan. Everything doesn't always end the way you think it will. (beat, then) 'Sides, audiences love happy endings.
167) 7) text: Gabriel strides away. We hear the WHINE of the EXPLORER as it does its final POWER UP for lift off. Stanley looks around the bus futilely for some way to stop Gabriel. Stan can hear the cavalry about to arrive. The Explorer slowly lifts upward.
171) 0) text: We see DOCTOR MICHEALS leaning over what is left of Gabriel's barely recognizable burned upper torso and head. Stan and Roberts walk into the room through the metal doors and stop at the end of the table. Dr. Micheals nervously looks up at Stanley and steps back. Stanley looks down at the body.
172) 1) dialog: Houdini made an elephant disappear in a room full of people.
172) 3) dialog: You know how he did it?
173) 1) dialog: Elephant suit.     Filled with his assistants.
173) 3) dialog: Assistants jump out. Blend in with the others.
174) 1) dialog: Voila. The elephant is gone.   Houdini throws up his hands.
174) 2) dialog: No more elephant.
175) 6) dialog: -- so advanced nowadays you could probably pilot it from your trailer.
175) 9) dialog: (smiling)
176) 0) text: Gabriel's "face" smooshed against the glass door.
180) 0) text: A MAN, whom we have not seen before but does maintain a certain "Gabriel" air about him, hiding behind shades, leans against a three-hundred-year-old column reading a newspaper. She walks toward him and he signals for the valet.
