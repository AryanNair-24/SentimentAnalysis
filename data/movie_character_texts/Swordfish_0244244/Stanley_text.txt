Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough said. The MAN across, however, is quite different. He is what they used to call a "cool-cat."
1) 17) dialog: No.
1) 19) dialog: Bad guy can't win. It's a morality tale. One way or the other, he's gotta go down.
2) 0) text: SILENCE -- no sounds on the SOUNDTRACK. Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway. Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues across the sidewalk and into the street. He nonchalantly looks up. Suddenly the THUMP of HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the soundtrack. Pandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and a bunch of news vultures. Squad cars block off both ends of the street while SWAT trucks, news vans, and looky- loos are packed together into the distance. Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are positioned on every open rooftop. Hundreds of weapons are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in the world. Slowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street. Gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus blocks most of the windows. He walks beside the bus, under a huge "WORLD BANC" sign, and through the glass front door, which shuts IN OUR FACE.

27) 7) dialog: As we hear the DOOR SHUT and SOMEONE COMES UP the aluminum extension ladder. A few moments later, in SLOW MOTION, GINGER appears at the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailer's roof. Stan turns around. She is what the hack writers of the Thirties would call a vision. Thesauruses could be exhausted searching for adjectives that do her justice. In the low-rent light of Stanley's white trash haven, she is, by definition, a goddess.
27) 8) dialog: Who are you supposed to be?
27) 13) dialog: Is that right?
27) 23) dialog: How'd you get past my dog?
27) 25) dialog: Great.   What are you selling again?
27) 32) dialog: You're fucking up my chi.

55) 23) text: Stanley sits down.    Gabriel pours Stan a glass of Crown

55) 28) text: Gabriel smiles. The beautiful WOMAN to Stanley's right slides closer.
55) 30) text: Stanley looks at her, she's a knockout; artificially perfect. He looks back at Gabriel.

55) 41) text: Helga shoots the tequila, then turns to Stanley, places her lips against his. The gold liquid drips from their lips as she spits it into Stanley's mouth. He pushes her away, breaking the liplock, and swallowing the tequila. She licks it from his face.

55) 45) text: Stanley's having a little trouble concentrating on Gabriel.
55) 46) dialog: Nothing's impossible.
55) 47) text: Helga begins sucking on Stanley's fingers.      He pulls away.
55) 52) dialog: Something like that. Is this an interview?
55) 54) text: The drapes close. Two of Gabriel's crew step out. Marco yanks out a .40 caliber Glock and quickly screws a well- used silencer onto the end. Marco walks around behind Stanley.
55) 55) dialog: (now totally confused) What are you doing?
55) 56) text: Helga smiles, then drops her head into Stanley's lap. hear his PANTS UNZIP.
55) 60) dialog: You're kidding...
55) 64) text: The silencer is pressed into the back of his head. Stanley tries to focus on the screen. Stanley sucks air through his teeth, trying to focus.

56) 10) dialog: Help? Help what, squeegee my brain off the ceiling?
56) 13) dialog: A test... I don't know why I let you talk me into this. I can't believe how desperate I am.
56) 14) text: She exhales toward Stanley.
56) 17) dialog: (pissed) Look... I'd do anything to get Holly back. But, if I end up in a box or back in jail, then I really can't help her, can I? What I should do, is take my money and go back to court.
56) 19) dialog: What I'm thinking about is that you're willing to put a gun to my head to see if I can hack --
56) 27) dialog: As he realizes she's right, he's got nothing to lose. Slam! He smacks the mirror with his fist, then walks out of the rest room. Ginger slowly lifts the cigarette. She exhales, then slowly smiles. She's got him.

60) 2) dialog: So?
60) 7) dialog: What kind of cypher?
60) 9) dialog: A Vernam's impossible. Its key code is destroyed upon implementation. Not to mention being a true 128 bit encryption.
60) 11) dialog: It's impossible.
60) 14) dialog: Nothing's impossible.
60) 17) dialog: What?
60) 25) dialog: I don't know. It's gonna be pretty hard without a gun to my head.
60) 33) dialog: I thought you were Gabriel's.
61) 4) dialog: Pretty impressive.
61) 6) dialog: (beat, then like "stupid") The book, Ginger.

64) 9) dialog: It's okay, baby. Let me give you a ride home. He grabs her stuff.
64) 10) dialog: C'mon. He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back. They laugh as he carries her to the car.
65) 1) dialog: You believe in me, right?
65) 3) dialog: I've found a way to get you back, sweetheart. It's my one shot and I'm taking it. Just give me a couple of days.
65) 6) dialog: Holly, everything's going to be okay. You just have to trust me.
65) 8) text: I love you, Daddy. Holly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying, from the car at full speed, with the giraffe. Stanley, tears rolling down his face, slaps the steering wheel, trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so badly.

Then it really gets bad. Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill to help control the erosion. To Stanley however, it is the world's largest Slip and Slide. He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent. Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent. Roberts, above him, is doing little better.
70) 0) text: On the other side, Stan runs down to the beach and runs down the sand at full-tilt, looking for any escape route. Roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian accident which slowed him down a little. Stan however is faster. Stan does his best Jerry Rice, as he runs down the beach at full speed. Suddenly, the Taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach at Stanley. Stan veers, now running through the surf. The Taurus veers as well, and Stan is forced to slide across the hood to keep from getting whacked. The Taurus breaks left, and slides further into the surf. The FBI driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus down, tires spinning, throwing sand. Stan continues to run as Roberts makes it to the Taurus.
70) 6) dialog: (catching his breath)
70) 12) dialog: Are you arresting me?
70) 16) dialog: Then why are we talking?
70) 18) dialog: Fuck you.
70) 20) dialog: You'll have to forgive me, the fact that you put me in jail for 18 months doesn't inspire a lot of trust.
70) 22) dialog: I guess we were both doing what we had to. This was a nice trip down memory lane, but if you're not arresting me...
70) 27) dialog: I told you --
70) 29) dialog: I'm a sucker for Disneyland. (getting up) Tell Torvalds I said hello.

71) 11) dialog: Little accident. (tossing her her keys) Sorry about your car. I've had a pretty shitty day so far. Looks like it just got worse. (beat) Who are you, Ginger?
71) 13) dialog: (incredulous) You can't tell me? Well, that's just fuckin' peachy.
71) 15) dialog: (loudly) Who are you?
73) 1) dialog: That's not my problem, is it? You're asking for a lot of faith here, Ging, without givin' me any. You --
73) 3) dialog: -- brought me into this mess --
73) 5) dialog: -- I deserve to know who's playing me, Ginger. (hitting each word) Who the fuck are you?
75) 4) text: Stanley, in one quick thinking movement, rips the wire from Ginger's chest and flings it behind the bed just as the door swings open. Gabriel stands staring at them. Ginger topless, weapon in hand and Stanley who looks like he had the shit kicked out of him. Ginger and Stanley both stare at him.
75) 10) text: Stanley looks at Ginger for a beat.
75) 11) dialog: Actually...
75) 12) text: Ginger stares at Stanley, who turns to look at Gabriel. Gabriel looks at Stan, waiting.
75) 13) dialog: Thought maybe you'd like to see me get you your hydra.
75) 18) dialog: C'mon.
75) 19) text: Gabriel walks into the hall. Stanley looks back at Ginger who mouths the words "Thank you." Stanley ignores her. Ginger reaches down and grabs a shirt off the bed.
75) 21) dialog: (deadpan) Funny.

Ginger walks in.      She stands behind Stan as he works.
76) 2) dialog: Terribly.
77) 4) dialog: My senior year at M.I.T., I created the source code for the worm that I've been using for years.
77) 6) dialog: In the basement and through a file room is the only P.D.P.-10 still active and on the internet, although only a few people know this. It's an I.T.S. machine and kept online just for historical sake. I hid my worm inside it where no one would ever think to look.
77) 12) dialog: Now I just have to modify the code.
77) 19) dialog: (ignoring that) You know, it'd be a lot simpler if you would tell me exactly what the hydra is going to be used for?
78) 2) dialog: Nope.
79) 2) text: Gabriel gets out of the car, still talking.       Stanley follows.
80) 0) text: Gabriel and Stanley walk through the door and sit down at a window table.
80) 4) dialog: Money that just sorta disappeared.
80) 6) dialog: Before we can tap into the secure cluster, you have to find one of the banks on the backbone of this network. Do you know how many banks there are in the U.S.? It could take years.
80) 8) text: Stanley turns and looks out the window.    They are sitti directly across from the World Banc.

94) 2) dialog: 
94) 3) dialog: Fuck!! He drops the BOTTLE of wine.   CRASH, it SHATTERS.
94) 5) dialog: Jesus Christ! Stanley looks at the body for a moment, realizes something really bad is going on and hauls ass upstairs.
95) 0) text: Stanley runs around the corner. Gabriel is standing in the doorway, directly in front of Stanley. Stan damn near falls down.
95) 8) dialog: (uneasy) Okay...
95) 10) dialog: Why can't we talk here?
95) 12) text: Gabriel walks out.       Stanley slowly follows.
96) 2) dialog: (obviously not fine) Fine.
96) 4) dialog: (freaked) What the hell is going on here?
96) 12) dialog: How?
96) 16) dialog: What are you doing?
96) 21) dialog: Shit, it's blocked.
96) 30) text: Stanley slides under Gabriel as Gabriel steps into the passenger side. The wheels spin, the Lambo is wedged under the Suburban.
96) 33) dialog: I am!
96) 34) text: Finally the mortally wounded but still kicking Lamborghini tears free of the Suburban and rockets head- toward the other. Stanley drives like a maniac. Gabriel RIPS it on FULL-AUTO, meatloafing the driver. The Suburban veers into the wall. Smack. Stanley whips beside it and Gabriel STRAFES down the side, opening it up. Stan whips right onto a main street.

97) 0) text: Stanley is working at his terminal.

Even if I do survive this, who's gonna keep me out of jail? You? She walks over to him and kneels down, places her hand on his leg, looks up at him.
97) 4) dialog: Trust you? Two hours ago I found out you're D.E.A. The feds are crawling up my ass and there's a dead body in the basement that looks just like Gabriel. She doesn't move.
97) 6) dialog: Your little slush fund is not my problem. I'm pulling the plug on this rodeo. Roberts may be an asshole, but he is definitely the lesser of the two evils.
97) 12) dialog: You're starting to sound just like him.
97) 13) text: They look at each other.    Stanley turns toward the computer screens.

105) 4) dialog: Like me?   You're a murderer.
105) 11) dialog: I don't understand why the fuck you're telling me this.
105) 13) dialog: I don't care about any of this. All I care about is my daughter.
105) 15) dialog: My daughter...
105) 17) dialog: So you and your band of lunatics are really stealing all this money to protect me.

119) 11) text: Stanley's heart almost stops.    He sighs as Gabriel toss him the giraffe.

124) 1) dialog: Won't do you any good. The money jumps every 60 seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the next ten years.

124) 6) dialog: You let the hostages go and then I'll tell you where and when you can extract the money. We all walk away, nobody gets hurt. The accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher. Even I can't break through the fire wall. It's my act of God policy. (beat) Deal?

The MISSILE EXPLOSION combined with the fuel creates a tremendous fireball. Roberts runs and tackles Stanley to the ground. Suddenly, SWAT GUYS dressed in full combat gear including masks tha cover their faces surround them. They cuff them.    One of them almost steps on Stanley's face.
