3) 0) text: That same MIST floats across a plain embedded in the Scot mountains. Dark clouds are gathering in the sky above. Out of the mist walks Macbeth. He looks years older now, face roughly bearded. A leader, a powerful and ferocious warrior, his lean body cased in battered threadbare armou Behind him emerges his ROUGH ARMY. They are soldiers hardened against nature by years of fighting. Their WEAPONS hang heavily in their hands, thei scarce armour soaked in the showering rain. We recognise from the funeral, although time has clearly passed. First among their ranks is Banquo, Macbeth’s sturdy secon this war. His eyes, like the eyes of all of the men, are fixed on something straight ahead across the plain. Apprehensive. A group of about THIRTY REINFORCEMENTS. They are little m than boys, 14-16 years old. Virgins to war, they’re terri -- but also excited. Macbeth and Banquo look at each other with concern: these recruits are not what they were expecting. The difference between the men and the boys is startling.
3) 1) text: Macbeth’s army checks and re-checks their weapons, the ol men doing it for the young boys, like fathers taking thei sons through a rite of passage. They smear the boys’ face with black soil to match their own -- war-paint. Two BROTHERS from the virgin soldiers nervously laugh as daub each other’s faces. A MONK crosses himself, his face also painted for the fig A YOUNG BOY SOLDIER (15) swallows down panic desperately. More than the others he looks out of place in this battle unproven. His hands are shaking too hard to grip his own sword and he drops it again and again, hopeless, as thick tears stream down his face. Nearby, like his men, Macbeth is readying himself. Ritualistically his hands run over his weapons, preparing each for its quickest draw: A LONG-SWORD edged with dents; a BASELARD on his back; a KNIFE coarsened with use; TWO DAGGERS sheathed on either of his waist. His body a machine of war. He is wearing a tabard that marks him out as the leader o this force. Sewn into it is the Scottish symbol of the Rampant Lion and, smaller, the crest of his house, Glamis Tied onto the tabard are DOG TAGS from soldiers who have fallen in past battles. He looks down the line of his men, inspecting them. Their fear palpably assuages at his presence: they owe him thei lives. Loyal. Then, Macbeth notices the shaking Young Boy Soldier. He starts down the line towards him. Each Soldier bows their head as he passes out of respect. All the Soldiers and yo boys are wearing DOG TAGS marked with the same insignia. He comes to a halt in front of the Young Boy Soldier and takes him in. The boy stares up in awe, his tears stopped Calmly Macbeth rips a piece of fabric from his uniform an picks up the fallen sword. Carefully he binds it to the Y Boy Soldier’s hand, fast. Their eyes meet: it’s time. At this, a dim noise becomes noticeable on the edge of hearing. A RUMBLE. It is getting LOUDER. One of the Young Soldiers tries to control his breaths, e one catching in his throat. ANOTHER of his young comrades vomits in fear. ANOTHER chews his lip ferociously until it bleeds. The TWO BROTHERS stand wide-eyed with terror. They face e other, cajoling each other on. A BEARDED SOLDIER mutters a prayer over and over again, senseless now, stumbling over the words and re-starting. ANOTHER repeatedly squeezes the hilt of his crude sword. ANOTHER swings his weapon through the air, rehearsing the coming strokes. ANOTHER pounds his chest with his fist. ANOTHER checks over his armour obsessively, its inadequac horribly clear. The MONK breathes out evenly, a cross to his lips, his fa steadied by the effort of control. And, taking his place at their fore -- MACBETH cuts his own hand. He picks up some of the Scotti earth. Rubs it into the wound. He then looks to Banquo and smiles. Takes his friend’s he in his hands and kisses it hardily. Banquo nods to him. Ready. And, finally, Macbeth turns with the men to face:
