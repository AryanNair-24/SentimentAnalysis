17) 56) dialog: Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the fuck off MacArthur's Black Mile. They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.
17) 59) dialog: Could have been worse. Know what I'm saying? They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the R He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. Th starts up and drives off.
17) 61) dialog: Can I have this ham?
17) 63) dialog: Great! PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mou wolfing it down hungrily.
17) 65) dialog: I told you, North. Do you have a map? GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.
17) 66) dialog: Not when we're driving, Graham.
17) 73) dialog: Just head North. We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them.

18) 50) dialog: Just Paul. You know, like Madonna or Dracula.
18) 53) dialog: I am man, seriously.
18) 55) dialog: Wormhole.
18) 59) dialog: And what's the most plausible explanation, Clive?
18) 66) dialog: There's no such thing as a thin midget? Those guys are built. Have you not seen The Station Agent?
18) 69) dialog: Ow! Get off me!
18) 72) dialog: Get off me, you fucking psycho!
19) 32) dialog: 
21) 2) dialog: Nowhere.
21) 4) dialog: It's not invisibility per so. It's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure.
21) 6) dialog: Exactly.
21) 8) dialog: 
23) 0) text: CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM sno on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.

23) 3) dialog: Hey, look who's up!
23) 17) dialog: You got it? Yes I've got it.
23) 18) dialog: It's hot. (slightly testy) Thank you. GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs an sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...
23) 19) dialog: Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you. Am i right? CLIVE doesn't deny it.
23) 20) dialog: And I appreciate the fact that I have somewhat gate-crashed the party here but, truth be told, I'm in a hell of a pickle. I really need your help.
23) 27) dialog: Why not? CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.
23) 32) dialog: Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.

26) 0) text: GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.
26) 2) dialog: Here's what I need. Some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas.
31) 0) text: PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&amp;Ms in his mouth. GRAH drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.
31) 8) dialog: That's their excuse for everything. There are worse things you can be. We had a Muslim guy at the base. Systems analyst called Yusef. We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights. You should'a heard him do Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum.
31) 10) dialog: We're hardly the only RV on the road. Trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey. BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps. GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.
32) 1) dialog: Fuck, that made me jump.

34) 31) dialog: Let me ask you something. Are you to...?
34) 33) dialog: You know... PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating various "group' and "one on one' homosexual practices.
34) 35) dialog: Okay, that's great. I just wondered. I'm cool with it. Everyone's "bi' where I'm from. It's all about the pleasure thing, you know? We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like "smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum.
34) 37) dialog: Maybe you should start smoking.

39) 4) dialog: Too soon? They nod.
39) 5) dialog: Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break bread with you guys. What are we having? GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.
40) 0) text: CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks h tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materialize nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.
40) 6) dialog: Hello Clive. From the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue, am I do assume you're a Hendrix fan?
40) 8) dialog: I met him once.
40) 10) dialog: Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He thought I was a hallucination. Shame what happened to him.
40) 12) dialog: Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases album seventeen. PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.
40) 14) dialog: I know, right? Time flies when you're confined to a U.S. military installation.
40) 16) dialog: I'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force.
40) 18) dialog: I'm fucking with you, man. I was on a science mission actually. Meteorological reconnaissance. We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class planets. My specialist subject is tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field.
40) 25) dialog: Next thing I know, this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to Area 52.
40) 28) dialog: No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit. It's another "clever subterfuge." GRAHAM joins them with the food.
40) 29) dialog: Just telling him about Area 52.
40) 31) dialog: So, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing.
40) 33) dialog: Mulder was my idea. They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.
41) 0) text: RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL a on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see t pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted against the campfire. She frowns.

42) 42) dialog: 
42) 58) dialog: Oh yeah? (stepping out of the toilet) Well then how do you explain me? RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye r up, her hair turns white. She collapses.
42) 59) dialog: And that's Jenga.
42) 61) dialog: I didn't do anything, she fainted.
42) 63) dialog: Oh come on. Who's gonna believe anything she says?
42) 65) dialog: What, a delusional, one-eyed God botherer?
42) 67) dialog: I didn't think of that.
42) 69) dialog: What?
43) 0) text: The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passpor He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until h spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.

44) 0) text: PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES wh loading a shotgun.
44) 1) dialog: 
45) 8) dialog: Hey, look who's up.
45) 17) dialog: Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies. Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone.
45) 24) dialog: Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice!
45) 27) dialog: You can't win can you? RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, makin awful noise.
45) 30) dialog: Oh, for God's sake. PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAU telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigaret
45) 32) dialog: I broadened her horizons.
45) 34) dialog: No, it's tiring. GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.
45) 41) dialog: Come here then. PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls
45) 43) dialog: Can't I just tell you?
51) 0) text: CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.
51) 1) dialog: Wow. Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE, looking out through the RV's windshield. We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beau They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, look out across the vista.
51) 2) dialog: There it is, boys. Wyoming.
51) 4) dialog: Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd aren't onto something. I mean look at it. Hey Ruth, get up here. They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone
51) 5) dialog: Ruth!?
53) 3) dialog: From X-Men.
54) 2) dialog: 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on! It's fun. We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of t road watching PAUL.
56) 0) text: GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shi emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.

56) 13) dialog: Pick that up then.
56) 18) dialog: Right up top! RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again
56) 19) dialog: Too soon? CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.
63) 9) dialog: Yo fucknuts! The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few feet from them, their eyes bulge.
63) 10) dialog: So, who wants to get probed first? The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.
63) 12) dialog: Tell me you got the food? CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food. Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.
63) 17) dialog: Get in the RV! SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, jus the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES loc eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realise doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night, leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.
64) 5) dialog: I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone wanna take a walk?
64) 9) dialog: Sorry about that.
64) 11) dialog: You gotta talk the talk, right?

66) 3) dialog: No.
66) 5) dialog: No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel.
66) 7) dialog: Paul Simon. Paul's not my real name. It's a name I got given.
66) 9) dialog: You won't be able to pronounce it.
66) 11) dialog: What a geek.
66) 19) dialog: Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.
66) 21) dialog: That's pretty good.
66) 23) dialog: Fuck you!
66) 26) dialog: That was my gag! "Take me to your dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine. Never saw a dime.
66) 28) dialog: The little girl who found me when I crashed. It was terrible actually. I killed her dog. I didn't mean to! My ship sort of landed on it. When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying "Paul? Paul?" It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over. Spooks thought it was my name.
66) 30) dialog: Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.
66) 37) dialog: Who knows? Never saw her again. Think about her everyday though. PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PA takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though governed by some kind of psychic link.

66) 44) dialog: I've outlived my usefulness.
66) 46) dialog: There's only so much knowledge I can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich. The only thing I have to offer them now are my abilities.
66) 48) dialog: So the only way they're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells.
66) 55) dialog: Negative.
66) 57) dialog: Sadly, not that simple.
66) 59) dialog: Believe me, a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me.
66) 61) dialog: Stem cells are multipotent. GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.
66) 62) dialog: Lineage defined? GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.
66) 65) dialog: Bingo! Fortunately, someone was kind enough to give me the heads up, if you'll pardon the pun. So, when they were transferring me to the medical facility and I noticed the bumper sticker on your RV, I figured you might be sympathetic types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed the wheel and took my chance.
66) 72) dialog: Well it was, kinda.
66) 74) dialog: So tell me, are you guys virgins or what?
66) 76) dialog: Alright then, Clive, when was the last time you got laid.
66) 78) dialog: Three years ago you had sex with a midget?
66) 80) dialog: There are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an Ewok costume.
66) 82) dialog: I can't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature.
66) 84) dialog: Was it nice?
66) 92) dialog: You sly dog! PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into hi beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass ou

Next to him is a child, (8) small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at th cover of the comic and back at PAUL.
70) 1) dialog: How's it going?
70) 3) dialog: No.
70) 5) dialog: Suppose it does. What's your name?

76) 5) dialog: What you got there, a stigmatism?
76) 11) dialog: You know you can get on operation for that, right?
76) 13) dialog: Hey, I don't know categorically that it's godless. I just said "probably'.
76) 15) dialog: Look, the way you're feeling now, that's why religion appeared in the first place. It's like existential Prozac. Imagine being five year sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for. That's how it is for much of humanity. Faith is a night- light. It illuminates the scary corners, fills the gaps, makes the universe easier to comprehend. Thing is, it's okay not to know everything. I mean, who knows what's really out there? Did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter?
76) 17) dialog: Oh. Well, then you get it, right? If they have the theory, who's to say at some point in the future they won't put it into practice and who's to say someone else didn't do that 13.5 Billion years ago and that's how the universe came to be? Course, then we get the eternal problem of who created the creator but that's a whole other car park. I think Shakespeare said it best. "There's more in Heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy Horatio".
76) 24) dialog: Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You know, the Prince of Denmark?
76) 26) dialog: Anyway, if there is a God, didn't he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't have to go round fixing people's lazy eyeballs?
76) 28) dialog: The eye is a delicate and complex thing, Ruth. You should get it taken care of. RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the wind just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.
