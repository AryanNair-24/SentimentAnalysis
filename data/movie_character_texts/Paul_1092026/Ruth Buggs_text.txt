35) 24) dialog: Where you heading next?
35) 26) dialog: England?
35) 28) dialog: I love London.
35) 30) dialog: No. Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?
35) 32) dialog: Oh. I'd love to go someday.
35) 39) dialog: There's lots a places I wanna go. Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The world's a big place. I need one of these though.

42) 44) dialog: Explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being.
42) 46) dialog: They eye is comprised of three interacting parts. Remove any one of them and it ceases to exist. It has the precision and delicacy of a pocket watch and, when the good Lord permits, it works in perfect harmony with its environment. Something as functionally perfect as that doesn't just occur without the intervention of a guiding hand.
42) 48) dialog: What are you talking about?
42) 50) dialog: It'd design!
42) 57) dialog: Nothing you can so or do can shake my belief, or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that God made Heaven and earth and created us all in His own image.

52) 0) text: RUTH is storming up the road.
52) 2) dialog: Leave me alone!
52) 10) dialog: He can't be from space. It's not possible.
52) 12) dialog: So, where is everybody?
52) 14) dialog: Everything I've ever been told is a lie. My purpose. My truth. All false. DO you know how that feels? To suddenly have nothing?
52) 16) dialog: Huh?
52) 18) dialog: I do feel lonely and unimportant! How can this all be an accident? It doesn't make sense. Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth? GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.
52) 19) dialog: How can that be an accident.
52) 26) dialog: But what's the point? If there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living?

56) 1) dialog: You don't mind, do you, Graham?
56) 9) dialog: What?
56) 15) dialog: Maybe I should call Papa.
56) 17) dialog: Look, I've been missing for a whole day. If he's called the police, they'll be looking for us and if they find us, this "amazing adventure' is going to come to an end real quick. I just need to tell him I'm fine and that I'll be back soon, okay? PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.
