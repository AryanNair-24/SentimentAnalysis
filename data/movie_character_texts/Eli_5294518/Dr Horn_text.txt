HORN (CONT’D) In a normal healthy body, antibodies are produced by a gene found within the bone marrow. But in your case, the gene that produces those antibodies malfunctions and ceases production. Through the reflection Eli can see Dr. Horn removing item from packaging on the medical tray, but his own reflectio obscures what the items actually are. DR. HORN (CONT’D) That means the first step to curing you is isolating the gene, and figuring out how to make it function again. In order to do that, I have to harvest the marrow. The procedure takes up to an hour, so I’m going to give you a general anaesthetic which will put you to sleep. When you wake up you’ll feel groggy, and you might be nauseous which is absolutely normal. Nothing to worry about. In the reflection Eli sees Dr. Horn raise a large hypoder needle.
