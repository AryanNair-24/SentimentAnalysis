Both are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer, her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.

A RED GLOW from the far end of the room-- GREER flicks on overheads. The Landlady hovers by the door as they move into the place. It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE, contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to accomodate a curvaceous female body.

A WINDOW overlooks the factory floor. Here, TECHNICIANS sit at COMPUTER STATIONS, monitoring the processes below. GREER and PETERS stand before WATERS, who looks like a basketball player-- hugely tall, African-American, tattooed, in casual clothes. GREER waves a hand up in his face, trying to get his attention.

COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS are arranged radially, at the hub is a central COMMAND STATION with large SCREENS facing in all directions. GREER and PETERS move toward the center. At first we see just the head and shoulders of scattered FIGURES, staring at the monitor screens. ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of SURROGATES, the Feds can have a direct surveillance feed from any surrogate's eyes. We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar-- intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex partner's face. The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES, specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have the same faces. PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work. They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS up here at once. ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry store-- packets of drugs changing hands. BOBBY eats candy, guzzles soda, waves them off for a moment, speaking rapid-fire into his HEADSET.

He has trouble speaking.

She reacts to the sound of-- --SCREAMS and SCREECHING TIRES from outside the building. PETERS looks toward a large WINDOW to the street-- and immediately dives for cover as-- --a battered SUV, spray-painted with anti-surrogate GRAFFITI, SMASHES through the plate glass. SURRIE PEDESTRIANS are plastered across the grill and embedded in the windshield. THE SUV slams into a few SURRIES in the lobby, sends them flying or runs over them. It spins sideways into a WALL with the FBI SEAL overhead. The DRIVER leaps out, armed with a MACHINE GUN. He's clearly a DREAD, angry and deranged. He starts SHOOTING at anything that moves. PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and smash MARBLE around her. An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and riot helmets, armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES. They instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire. The agents move to the DREAD'S BODY-- he's very dead, pouring BLOOD from dozens of bullet wounds. One speaks into his headset:
