51) 0) text: GREER and PETERS go down metal stairs into-a sprawling, high-tech surveillance center. COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS are arranged radially, at the hub is a central COMMAND STATION with large SCREENS facing in all directions. GREER and PETERS move toward the center. At first we see just the head and shoulders of scattered FIGURES, staring at the monitor screens. ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of SURROGATES, the Feds can have a direct surveillance feed from any surrogate's eyes. We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar-- intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex partner's face. The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES, specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have the same faces. PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work. They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS up here at once. ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry store-- packets of drugs changing hands. BOBBY eats candy, guzzles soda, waves them off for a moment, speaking rapid-fire into his HEADSET.
51) 1) dialog: Burglary in progress, Charlie4639- Romeo7812-Sierra8955, need a warrant to shut him down... BOBBY gets a message from his headset, kicks his rolling chair across the room to a special TERMINAL.
51) 2) dialog: Warrant received.
51) 12) dialog: Anybody, anywhere. Ssh, don't tell anyone. It's a gray area legally. PETERS isn't comfortable with this.
51) 13) dialog: Relax, we're the good guys.
51) 16) dialog: No ma'am, you're looking at the genuine article. Bobby Sanders. He extends a greasy hand, which she shakes lightly.
51) 19) dialog: (points at his head) Ain't built the machine yet that can handle this baby. Recognition search caught your dreaddie, screen 11. They move to a screen numbered 11, Bobby taps a CONTROL.
51) 28) dialog: Baltimore, corner of Eastern and Decker. Got a feeling he's headed for the reservation.
55) 2) dialog: You really look like your surrie?
55) 10) dialog: Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged to B-47 down there. He points to one of the many identical female DRONES buzzing along the tracks. PETERS smiles.
132) 0) text: TIGHT ON BOBBY, the overweight controller, at his station. He looks nervous, wearing his HEADSET. (CONTINUED)    
132) 3) text: Bobby, it's Greer, I need a remote shutdown. You'll have the surrie's digital address on file, Agent Jennifer Peters. CAMERA MOVES to reveal that PETERS (the surrie) is holding BOBBY at GUNPOINT, a grim expression on her face. She doesn't realize Bobby's on the phone.
132) 5) text: Peters, have you gone insane? Put the gun away, what the hell are you trying to prove? PETERS ignores him, watching the TERMINAL SCREEN. WIDER now, we see that all the SURRIE WATCHERS have disconnected, they're stationary on their tracks. THE GLOWING MONITORS remain on, showing random scenes, unwatched. MOVEMENT at the elevated entrance-- --PETERS spins and FIRES HER HANDGUN in that direction. The intruder retreats. We now see a couple of SURRIES have already been dropped here, sprawled on the staircase leading down, bullets in their heads. PETERS spins on Bobby, who's WHISPERING frantically into HIS HEADSET: BOBBY (CONT'D)
132) 6) text: She's into the entire surrie database, I dunno what she's-- Peters YANKS off Bobby's headset and throws it aside.
137) 0) text: STONE enters warily, looking toward PETERS and the captive BOBBY. STONE
137) 1) text: Peters! It's me, Andy Stone! Hands in the air, Stone moves down the stairs, stepping gingerly over the fallen surrogates. PETERS finishes CUFFING BOBBY'S WRISTS to a chair with plastic cuffs. She moves to get a look at Stone, across the expanse of glowing monitors. She's holstered her gun. PETERS
137) 7) text: We spend years trying to nail you for funding the Dreads-- and now you hand yourself over to us on a silver platter. Hijacking an agent, destroying federal property, creating a hostage situation... Peters pulls her gun and points it at BOBBY'S HEAD. He cowers in his chair. STONE (CONT'D)
139) 1) text: --the RIOT AGENTS all FREEZE'IN PLACE for a second-- and then drop at once. Unlike with Stone, there's no twitching, smoke or exploding eyeballs. The sudden silence is eerie. PETERS rises and moves to STONE, the grotesque, empty- eyed surrogate. Her expression is grim, but she's accomplished an important part of her mission. BOBBY looks around at the many fallen bodies. BOBBY
142) 0) text: ON THE TERMINAL - numbers still HIGHLIGHTING, flying past at incredible speed. MOVE TO FIND PETERS, with an open TOOLBOX. She's expertly wiring the O.D. to the keyboard, cutting, splicing and reattaching wires. BOBBY wheels closer, tries to KICK the O.D. Without flinching, PETERS KNOCKS him back across the room, the chair FALLS OVER and Bobby moans.
149) 2) text: WIDER, a dozen SURROGATES, different ages and sexes, lined up in their charging bays. Clearly, Canter can become anyone he wants to be. GREER is momentarily stunned to see-- THE PROPHET, a spare surrogate, in a charging bay. GREER moves carefully onward. Around a corner, he sees-- --a PROJECTOR DISPLAY SCREEN. It's PETERS' POV on the FBI SURVEILLANCE CENTER, a glance toward the motionless RIOT AGENTS, to BOBBY struggling on the ground. PETERS' POV SETTLES on the numbers HIGHLIGHTING on the terminal. THE 0. D. is connected to the keyboard, BLUE DIODES FLASH, the jerry-rigging complete. REAL CANTER is visible from behind in an elaborate prosthetic WHEELCHAIR, a SENSORY PROJECTOR on his head. GREER moves toward him and RIPS OFF the headgear. REAL CANTER opens his eyes, startled. GREER
150) 0) text: PETERS is frozen in place by the-terminal. BOBBY, on the ground, realizes something's happened. He strains to see the numbers screen. ON SCREEN -- THE NUMBERS have stopped scrolling. A dialogue box: "FULL DATABASE SELECTED - UPLOADING SOFTWARE TO NETWORK" with a bar moving up slowly.
152) 2) text: How do I shut it down? (CONTINUED)     CONTINUED: BOBBY (BAFFLED)
152) 4) text: Bobby, this is Agent Greer! ON THE CATWALK - a HUMAN agent, he's a SNIPER in black, creeps into position, readying his rifle. PETERS/GREER helps BOBBY up, so that he can see the computer screen. Bobby remains cuffed.
152) 7) text: How?1 BOBBY
152) 9) text: This can really send a virus to every surrie on the network? BOBBY
152) 11) text: (pauses, surprised) So people aren't in any danger... BOBBY
154) 0) text: PETERS/GREER reaches for the keyboard again, hesitates. A moment of internal conflict. BOBBY stares, confused. BOBBY
154) 1) text: Do it! BANG! A CLEAN HEADSHOT drops PETERS/GREER in her tracks, ELECTRONIC GOO sprays the COMPUTER SCREEN. BOBBY spins in his chair. BOBBY (CONT'D) NOT
156) 0) text: BOBBY KICKS at the COMPUTER frantically, CRYING OUT. THE SNIPER reaches him, CUTS his HANDS free with a KNIFE. HUMAN SNIPER
156) 2) text: Freed, Bobby lunges at the keyboard, hitting keys in a frenzy, but-- ON SCREEN - "DISCONNECTING" changes to "OPERATORS DISCONNECTED..." Then, quickly-- "TRANSMITTING."
