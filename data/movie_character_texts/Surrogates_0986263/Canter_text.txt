1) 0) text: A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather, climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN. He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the building's entrance. A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT. THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at TUXEDO. SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER," along with other personal information below. THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety switches and buttons. The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can
36) 11) dialog: That's right. You're with the FBI.
37) 2) dialog: What progress have you made with the investigation?
37) 4) dialog: I allowed Tony to borrow one of my surrogates when he wanted to spend time in D.C. I encouraged him to take advantage of the cultural
37) 7) dialog: (closing the door) I wrote the code that remains at the core of all surrogates. It wasn't difficult for me to make my synth units accessible to my son.
37) 16) dialog: I suppose...
37) 19) dialog: It was attacked?
37) 22) dialog: No, but-- at the beginning, all of us at VSI were worried about it. It's why every surrogate has a built-in fail-safe, they disconnect before they can transmit a potentially dangerous signal.
37) 24) dialog: I... the sad fact is, Tony and I were just getting to know each other... he grew up with his mother in California. Canter's voice drifts off, he's starting to look far away, pained. He sits slowly behind his desk.
37) 25) dialog: If this wasn't an accident... then it's because of me that he's...
38) 0) text: --a small, PRIVATE AREA, bathed in RED LIGHT, with a very fancy, elaborate SENSORY PROJECTOR. REAL CANTER is much older than his surrogate, his face stubbly. His body is twisted and nearly useless, his head held up by a brace. A victim of some horrible degenerative disease, Canter only has the use of one arm, via an elaborate electronic armature. He's just disconnected his HEADSET. There are TEARS streaming down his cheeks. His projector SCREEN faces him, with his working arm he calls up an old MEMORY FILE.
39) 0) text: GREER and PETERS move from the entrance to Canter's residential high-rise.
49) 0) text: CANTER'S IMAGE on a COMPUTER SCREEN. It's his surrogate face, seated at his desk. This is a video-phone connection.
49) 1) dialog: Tell me, have you made any progress whatsoever? REVERSE ANGLE, Greer and Peters sit before the screen.
49) 4) dialog: Don't blow me off like I'm some goddamn reporter. I have resources of my own, do I have to do your jobs for you?
49) 13) dialog: What. What are you doing?
49) 15) dialog: I'm a target for assassination! I assume you're at least aware of that. WITH PETERS, she looks briefly over her shoulder at Greer with a "help, get me out of this" expression. He remains focussed on the image of the assassin, she turns back to Canter on the screen, maintaining her placating tone.
49) 17) dialog: I've heard enough of your condescending pap. The people who did this are going to be punished. CANTER DISCONNECTS, his angry face VANISHES. PETERS rises and moves quickly toward Greer.
91) 11) text: Check out Richie Rich. THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing a HOLSTERED SIDEARM. (CONTINUED)     69 CONTINUED: (2) ARMANDO

107) 4) text: Don't be ridiculous. (takes a sip, winces) This stuff is awful. He'scalling up a new file-- ON SCREEN - the name "LIONEL CANTER" followed by the words "CLASSIFIED - SCAN REQUIRED." A moment later, we see GREER'S IMAGE, a LIGHT FLICKERS from the webcam on the MONITOR FRAME. Then the words "UNAUTHORIZED USER." (CONTINUED)    
107) 8) text: What do you suppose VSI has against Canter? PETERS
107) 12) text: Wait a minute. You think VSI hired Strickland to kill Canter? GREER
109) 12) text: Not quite. What I can't figure out is why. Why kill Canter? STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to his desk, types into his COMPUTER. Greer approaches slowly. STONE
109) 15) text: Greer slips a LETTER OPENER off of Stone's desk as he nears. His hand is SHAKING. Suddenly-- --STONE yanks open a DRAWER and lunges for a GUN. But before he can bring it to bear-- --GREER STABS him in the back of the head, SKEWERING STONE'S CPU. STONE FREEZES, hunched over his desk, gun in hand. Greer just stares at what he's done for a moment, amazed. Then he waves a hand in front of Stone's open eyes, makes sure he's out, and-- --carefully pries off a plate and removes STONE'S MOTHERBOARD, places it on the desk. GREER pulls the gun out of Stone's hand, rolls him back in front of his desk, propped up to face the computer. Greer crouches behind him, operating the keyboard by reaching around his boss' body. ON COMPUTER - Greer types in a request for a FILE on LIONEL CANTER. The words "CLASSIFIED - IDENTITY SCAN REQUIRED" appear. GREER pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer, ducking down, lifts Stone's head by the hair. The monitor momentarily displays STONE'S FACE. A LIGHT goes on in the corner of the FRAME, scanning Stone. "AUTHORIZED USER" appears. GREER peeks up again, continuing his work. ON SCREEN - a HEADSHOT OF CANTER, reams of CLASSIFIED INFO. Greer hits PRINT.
115) 3) text: According to this, their number one supporter is Lionel Canter. PETERS
115) 5) text: Says he's funneled billions into their organization. Not to mention direct support for the man who calls himself the Prophet. Canter's bought him land, lawyers... and enough weapons to start a war.
117) 2) text: Not enough for a courtroom. But VSI knew that if Lionel Canter suffered a mysterious brain hemmorhage, the powers that be wouldn't be terribly upset. PETERS
117) 3) text: He's not some kind of monster, you know. Canter's initial research was in prosthetics-- for amputees, quadriplegics... people with degenerative diseases. Maybe he feels his technology's been perverted. Maybe it has. GREER studies her with interest, her tone is strangely passionate. GREER
117) 16) text: I don't believe you-- they killed Canter's son, a college kid, his whole life ahead of him! Don't we owe him something? She's genuinely upset. Greer won't meet her eye. (CONTINUED)    
117) 19) text: They will come after Canter again-- but you're just going to deposit your pension checks, look the other way and let him die. GREER
128) 22) text: (under his breath) Canter. REAL PETERS
136) 5) text: Listen to me. Dr. Canter is committing a crime via surrogate-- right now. If you don't cooperate and let me up there, you become an accomplice. CLERK
136) 13) text: I'm calling the police. The CLERK goes stock still, he's checked out-- he's obviously making the call from home. Greer shoves the inert body aside, it falls flat. He reaches for the elevator key, snatches it up when-- ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from behind, choking him. They stagger backward, GREER aims the gun behind his head and FIRES, blowing a HOLE in Armando's forehead. GREEN COOLANT, FRIED ELECTRONICS fly from the exit wound. They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from the frozen surrie's grip, clutching his ear, deafened by the gun's loud report. As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in the tableau-- the gun-wielding man, the two surries on the ground-- and dashes outside again. GREER hurries for CANTER'S PRIVATE ELEVATOR. He turns the key-- no light, nothing. He makes a frustrated NOISE and dashes for a nearby door to the stairwell.
141) 0) text: GREER has come out on the roof. There's an enormous CELL TOWER and DISH up here. He moves to the edge, peers over warily. ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street. GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves along the edge, looking for something. ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop. GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge, trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the momentum going the right way-- --but his grip gives a moment too soon-- GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way. But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back. HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn, blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion.

149) 2) text: WIDER, a dozen SURROGATES, different ages and sexes, lined up in their charging bays. Clearly, Canter can become anyone he wants to be. GREER is momentarily stunned to see-- THE PROPHET, a spare surrogate, in a charging bay. GREER moves carefully onward. Around a corner, he sees-- --a PROJECTOR DISPLAY SCREEN. It's PETERS' POV on the FBI SURVEILLANCE CENTER, a glance toward the motionless RIOT AGENTS, to BOBBY struggling on the ground. PETERS' POV SETTLES on the numbers HIGHLIGHTING on the terminal. THE 0. D. is connected to the keyboard, BLUE DIODES FLASH, the jerry-rigging complete. REAL CANTER is visible from behind in an elaborate prosthetic WHEELCHAIR, a SENSORY PROJECTOR on his head. GREER moves toward him and RIPS OFF the headgear. REAL CANTER opens his eyes, startled. GREER

151) 8) text: How many people are you? You're really the Prophet? CANTER

151) 10) text: --the image of the O.D. DEVICE UPLOADING SOFTWARE from PETERS' POV. Canter tries to block Greer's view-- CANTER (CONT'D)
151) 11) text: There's nothing you can do-- GREER PUSHES CANTER'S WHEELCHAIR out of the way violently. Greer sits on the floor, leaning against the wall. He takes a breath and puts on the PROJECTOR HEADSET. He slips on the FINGERSLEEVE, presses his fingers together and--
153) 2) text: CANTER stares at GREER, seeing that Greer realizes what's at stake-- the fate of humanity. CANTER
155) 0) text: GREER yanks off the headset, breathing hard, eyes wide with shock. CANTER regards him from his wheelchair. He's been watching the MONITOR, knows what just happened. CANTER

155) 7) text: What's going to happen? CANTER
155) 9) text: No--! Before Greer can stop him, CANTER BITES INTO IT and swallows. Greer tries to get the capsule from Canter's mouth-- but the man is DEAD within moments.
