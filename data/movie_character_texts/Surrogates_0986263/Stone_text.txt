33) 17) dialog: Get a room, you two. He leans between them, hits a button on Greer's computer. ON SCREEN - A NEW HAVEN PD LOGO at the top of the screen, indicating this is an EVIDENCE FILE. In a large WINDOW, TUXEDO'S POV RECORDING plays. We now see the foreplay in the alley from the other perspective. FOOTSTEPS, Tuxedo pulls away from the BLONDE-- --and turns to confront THE HELMETED ASSASSIN. TUXEDO's
33) 30) dialog: Lightning strike, according to forensics. A massive power surge shoots through the network...
33) 32) dialog: Got a better idea? In any case, let's be discreet about this. There'll be panic in the streets if the public gets the idea that using their surries can kill them... Greer is rewinding the IMAGE. He points to the face of the ASSASSIN, partly shielded within his helmet. They only get a partial of his face, it ENLARGES and HIGHLIGHTS.
33) 44) dialog: Stone here. Under no circumstances do you discuss this matter with anyone, inside or outside the Bureau. Got me?
76) 39) dialog: How ya' feeling, Greer?
76) 48) dialog: The pilot? They found him dead in his stim chair. Same with one of the Baltimore cops, other's in a coma. Four Dreads were killed on the ground, half a dozen wounded. Greer closes his eyes in misery.
76) 50) dialog: I would have to disagree. You requisitioned that chopper without authorization. You violated our treaty with the Dreads-- we're expecting retaliation. Those poor cops had no idea what they were up
76) 53) dialog: I'm sorry, Greer,. but- - you're suspended, pending further action. Greer nods slowly, knew this was coming. PETERS takes a step back, looking on carefully. Greer takes his LAPTOP COMPUTER off the bedside table, opens it so that Stone can see it.
76) 63) dialog: It's more than that. It means nobody is safe. The Dreads want us all to be like them-- living in fear, no better than animals. And we've only just freed ourselves, begun to explore our true potential.
76) 65) dialog: We will. Our way of life will be protected, whatever it takes. An attractive SURRIE NURSE enters the room.
76) 69) dialog: Just take some time to heal.
76) 71) dialog: Hasn't been-recovered. I'm afraid we can't supply you with a new one until this matter is resolved. Peters, make sure he gets home in one piece. PETERS nods, looking at Greer sympathetically. GREER sinks back into his pillow, anxious.
108) 4) text: Just cleaning out my desk. A moment later, STONE pokes his head out. STONE
108) 7) text: I almost forgot. Victor Welch sends his regards. Stone shakes his head, feigning incomprehension: STONE
108) 9) text: Guy at VSI. You looking forward to moving to the private sector--? Nakata is listening curiously. Stone angrily gestures for Greer to come into his office, he doesn't want to have this conversation in public. Greer keeps speaking as he heads inside. GREER (CONT'D)
108) 10) text: Will you finish out the year? We're sure gonna miss you around here... STONE SLAMS the door.
109) 1) text: I know it's hard to resist, better hours, better pay-- STONE
109) 4) text: (beat, grins) No. I was just fishing. STONE
109) 6) text: All surveillance on the Prophet goes through this office. Jack Strickland was one of your stoolies. Why the hell didn't you say something? STONE just stares at him, narrowing his eyes. GREER (CONT'D)
109) 10) text: --because you gave it to him. VSI makes them-- they hand one to you-- and you chose the trigger man. Your own little black op. If anyone looks, they blame the Dreads. But Strickland didn't follow the plan, did he? He didn't give you back the 0. D. like he was supposed to. STONE
109) 12) text: Not quite. What I can't figure out is why. Why kill Canter? STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to his desk, types into his COMPUTER. Greer approaches slowly. STONE
109) 15) text: Greer slips a LETTER OPENER off of Stone's desk as he nears. His hand is SHAKING. Suddenly-- --STONE yanks open a DRAWER and lunges for a GUN. But before he can bring it to bear-- --GREER STABS him in the back of the head, SKEWERING STONE'S CPU. STONE FREEZES, hunched over his desk, gun in hand. Greer just stares at what he's done for a moment, amazed. Then he waves a hand in front of Stone's open eyes, makes sure he's out, and-- --carefully pries off a plate and removes STONE'S MOTHERBOARD, places it on the desk. GREER pulls the gun out of Stone's hand, rolls him back in front of his desk, propped up to face the computer. Greer crouches behind him, operating the keyboard by reaching around his boss' body. ON COMPUTER - Greer types in a request for a FILE on LIONEL CANTER. The words "CLASSIFIED - IDENTITY SCAN REQUIRED" appear. GREER pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer, ducking down, lifts Stone's head by the hair. The monitor momentarily displays STONE'S FACE. A LIGHT goes on in the corner of the FRAME, scanning Stone. "AUTHORIZED USER" appears. GREER peeks up again, continuing his work. ON SCREEN - a HEADSHOT OF CANTER, reams of CLASSIFIED INFO. Greer hits PRINT.
110) 0) text: GREER emerges, a stack of PAPERS in his hand. He gives a nod to NAKATA, who nods back as he answers his RINGING PHONE. Before he can even say a word: STONE (FILTER)
110) 1) text: This is Stone! Nakata looks toward the office, starting to rise. NAKATA
111) 0) text: Upscale. The REAL STONE, a good deal heavier than his surrogate, is sitting in boxer shorts at the edge of his STIM CHAIR, a phone in his hand. STONE
117) 12) text: So what do we do about Stone? GREER
135) 0) text: A group of AGENTS in RIOT GEAR are gathered here, WEAPONS ready. One turns to see-- STONE approaching (his surrie is operational again), flanked by a couple of other AGENTS. RIOT AGENT
135) 1) text: She'll only speak with you, sir. STONE
135) 3) text: She's got a human hostage. Stone pauses, takes a breath. STONE
137) 0) text: STONE enters warily, looking toward PETERS and the captive BOBBY. STONE
137) 1) text: Peters! It's me, Andy Stone! Hands in the air, Stone moves down the stairs, stepping gingerly over the fallen surrogates. PETERS finishes CUFFING BOBBY'S WRISTS to a chair with plastic cuffs. She moves to get a look at Stone, across the expanse of glowing monitors. She's holstered her gun. PETERS
137) 2) text: Who was it, Stone? Who was it at VSI that hired you to kill me? Stone blinks, trying to process this. (CONTINUED)    
137) 4) text: Did you feel even a second of remorse, when you found out you'd murdered an innocent boy. He was eighteen! STONE
137) 6) text: Just tell me what I need to know. Stone considers this a bit, smiles. STONE
137) 7) text: We spend years trying to nail you for funding the Dreads-- and now you hand yourself over to us on a silver platter. Hijacking an agent, destroying federal property, creating a hostage situation... Peters pulls her gun and points it at BOBBY'S HEAD. He cowers in his chair. STONE (CONT'D)
137) 9) text: An eye for an eye... She points it at the back of Stone's head and-- --STONE's eyes go wide in agony-- and EXPLODE. He goes TUMBLING back down the stairs, SMOKE pouring from his head, BODY twitching crazily.
139) 1) text: --the RIOT AGENTS all FREEZE'IN PLACE for a second-- and then drop at once. Unlike with Stone, there's no twitching, smoke or exploding eyeballs. The sudden silence is eerie. PETERS rises and moves to STONE, the grotesque, empty- eyed surrogate. Her expression is grim, but she's accomplished an important part of her mission. BOBBY looks around at the many fallen bodies. BOBBY
140) 0) text: The PHONE IS RINGING. Move from it to-- STONE, in his stim chair, projector on his head... eyes rolled back, dead. BLOOD begins to seep from his ears.
