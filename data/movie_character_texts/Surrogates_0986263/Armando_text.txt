34) 16) dialog: Dr. Canter's rules. LIGHT flashes in their faces as they're scanned. The elevator doors open, and the three of them get on. CLOSE ON SCANNER - after they've entered the elevator, small HEAD-SHOTS of GREER and PETERS, vital stats below, appear one after the other on the SCREEN.

36) 0) text: THE ELEVATOR opens into a marble entrance area. It's traditional, tastefully opulent-- artwork, sculpture. A small, automated VACUUM CLEANER moves along a Persian rug. Armando moves ahead of them to announce their presence. Greer and Peters speak quietly.

91) 11) text: Check out Richie Rich. THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing a HOLSTERED SIDEARM. (CONTINUED)     69 CONTINUED: (2) ARMANDO
92) 1) text: You left this on my desk. ARMANDO has gotten behind the wheel, starts moving. Greer looks at the boy, amazed. GREER
136) 3) text: I wouldn't be. I'm here to arrest him. ARMANDO moves closer at this. CLERK
136) 6) text: Without a warrant, I'm afraid I can't help you. ARMANDO takes Greer by the arm in a painful grip. ARMANDO
136) 7) text: You're gonna have to leave, sir. Armando escorts Greer none too gently to the door. GREER
136) 8) text: Ow! Easy, I'm only human. As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left arm-- then gasps and clutches his chest, as if having a coronary. He stumbles, falls to his knees. Armando bends over him-- ARMANDO
136) 9) text: Are you OK? Greer suddenly thrusts his hand beneath the man's jacket. Armando reacts, begins to struggle with Greer-- BANG BANG beneath his suitcoat. Armando's ARM SPASMS WILDLY. He takes a few steps back, SPARKS and HYDRAULIC FLUID coming from his chest. GREER is holding the man's GUN now, aimed at him. ARMANDO (CONT'D)
136) 13) text: I'm calling the police. The CLERK goes stock still, he's checked out-- he's obviously making the call from home. Greer shoves the inert body aside, it falls flat. He reaches for the elevator key, snatches it up when-- ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from behind, choking him. They stagger backward, GREER aims the gun behind his head and FIRES, blowing a HOLE in Armando's forehead. GREEN COOLANT, FRIED ELECTRONICS fly from the exit wound. They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from the frozen surrie's grip, clutching his ear, deafened by the gun's loud report. As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in the tableau-- the gun-wielding man, the two surries on the ground-- and dashes outside again. GREER hurries for CANTER'S PRIVATE ELEVATOR. He turns the key-- no light, nothing. He makes a frustrated NOISE and dashes for a nearby door to the stairwell.
