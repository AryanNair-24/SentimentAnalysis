96) 2) text: MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in Greer's apartment with BRIAN and a French hunk named ANDRE, who speaks with a slight ACCENT. Everyone is pretty high. Andre closes one eye, then the other, pupils turned inward. ANDRE

96) 6) text: While you're at it-- I am so sick of twelve-inch dicks. MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a small JACKER, like the one we saw in the underground club.

104) 9) text: This place is a cross between a beautician's and an auto body repair shop. SURRIES in chairs that maneuver into all kinds of positions. Not only are they having nails and hair done, but legs lengthened, breasts enlarged, etc. (Operators check in their bodies and leave them there for modifications.) BRIDGET (CONT'D)
104) 14) text: No, Maggie, face to face. The two of us, for real. BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable. BRIDGET
