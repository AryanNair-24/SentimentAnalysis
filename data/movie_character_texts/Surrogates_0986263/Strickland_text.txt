52) 1) dialog: .maybe I'm not done with the O.D. Maybe you're not gonna get it back at all. Guy could have a lot of fun with your little toy... oh you can do better than that. I'll be in touch... He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his helmet, STARTS the bike and peels out.
56) 0) text: STRICKLAND moves briskly on his BIKE. He glances in his MIRROR and sees-- --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him. He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the corner ahead of him, SQUAWKS the SIREN. STRICKLAND changes direction, veers into a narrow alley.
57) 0) text: LOPEZ and GREER are directly overhead, watching STRICKLAND maneuver his bike quickly into the alley.
58) 0) text: The alley is a DEAD END, a FENCE blocking the exit. STRICKLAND skids the bike into a CRASHING STOP, knocking over piles of GARBAGE. A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side, pursuing. It stops at a narrowing space, cops squeeze out either door, aiming GUNS.
60) 0) text: STRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as-- GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER. STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner.
61) 0) text: LOPEZ turns the bird forward to pursue, as GREER reloads. They round the corner. No sign of Strickland on the pavement. GREER looks to his left, beyond the PILOT-- STRICKLAND has scaled a fire escape, aiming the DEVICE right at Lopez. Greer sees what's about to happen--
62) 0) text: STRICKLAND raises the device to track Lopez and hits the button-- we see the RED DIODES GLOW and--
67) 9) dialog: Oh my G-god-- why? What do you people want from me?!
67) 11) dialog: They were just surries! Goddamn machines!
75) 0) text: Early morning. STRICKLAND sleeps fitfully in this gloomy, dingy space. He comes to, startles at the sight
75) 3) dialog: No, Prophet, I---
75) 5) dialog: Please, I haven't done anything...
75) 7) dialog: I-- I swear to God I don't know--
75) 9) dialog: He never said his name, we talked on disposable cellphones-- I've never even seen his face! I couldn't tell you who he was if my life depended it!
88) 9) text: What happened to Jack Strickland? BUD
88) 13) text: Strickland was carrying a weapon. If it isn't recovered, there could be serious consequences-- for all of you. IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV. MILLER
89) 5) text: Didn't come up. Said they wanted Strickland's weapon. PROPHET
89) 6) text: Well, maybe I'll just have to bring it to their doorstep... In the Prophet's hand, we now see-- --the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his targets.
94) 1) text: This Strickland character. I don't believe he could have been acting on his own. GREER
95) 1) text: Somebody hired Strickland. You'll know who that is when you trace the weapon. GREER
102) 27) text: I found out about Strickland. She gestures to the boxes of documents. PETERS (CONT'D)
102) 30) text: The case files were removed, but there was a paper trail from payroll... Strickland was an informant. GREER (PERKING UP)
103) 0) text: CLOSE on a PHOTO of the DEVICE in Strickland's hand. The image has been ENLARGED, giving a pretty clear view of the weapon. BRANDON
107) 12) text: Wait a minute. You think VSI hired Strickland to kill Canter? GREER
109) 6) text: All surveillance on the Prophet goes through this office. Jack Strickland was one of your stoolies. Why the hell didn't you say something? STONE just stares at him, narrowing his eyes. GREER (CONT'D)
109) 10) text: --because you gave it to him. VSI makes them-- they hand one to you-- and you chose the trigger man. Your own little black op. If anyone looks, they blame the Dreads. But Strickland didn't follow the plan, did he? He didn't give you back the 0. D. like he was supposed to. STONE
