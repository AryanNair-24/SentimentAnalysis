She's Greer's wife, a stylish young woman, looking ridiculously good for someone who's just gotten up. Maggie starts at the sight of Greer, begins to retreat. It's as if she's stumbled upon him in the bathroom.
30) 1) dialog: Oh, sorry--
30) 3) dialog: But where's your...
30) 5) dialog: You just get in?

30) 20) dialog: 
30) 23) dialog: Because I think we're doing just fine.
30) 25) dialog: It's better.
30) 28) dialog: (likes the idea) Bridget said she got an amazing deal on a surrie rental in Tahiti-- she looked just like a native.
30) 37) dialog: 
30) 39) dialog: Sleep well. She takes her breakfast through a door in the hall just off the kitchen-- we can't see inside the room. We hear the DOOR LOCK behind her. GREER looks after his wife, a bit dejected. In the quiet he registers a voice from the TV: COMMERCIAL V.0. Remember... it wasn't long ago. ON TV - the sign "AIR QUALITY - UNHEALTHFUL." PEDESTRIANS with surgical MASKS and even GASMASKS. The sign "QUARANTINE." BODIES in a MASS GRAVE. The sign "TERROR ALERT - HIGH." A BUSY CITY STREET. Suddenly, a massive EXPLOSION, a car bomb going off. From the blast, BLEACH TO WHITE.

76) 0) text: CLOSE ON A MEDICAL MONITOR - high-tech imaging of a HUMAN BRAIN. MOVE DOWN to find GREER (the real one), asleep. An IV, BLEEPING monitors. Uneaten LUNCH on a tray. MAGGIE, her surrogate that is, sits in a chair beside the bed, her hand resting on GREER's. He stirs-- she pulls her hand back, returns to her fashion magazine. A TV plays above his bed, Greer blinks, squints at this. ON TV - a small BOY CLIMBS a very tall TREE above a suburban sidewalk, pleasant MUSIC. Suddenly, a BRANCH BREAKS, the boy tumbles with a CRY. GREER winces distastefully. ON TV - now we see the BOY again, perfectly fine, standing beside his mother. She strokes his head with a smile. They look down at his broken SURROGATE on the ground beside the fallen BRANCH. COMMERCIAL V.0. Imagine a world where children are safe. Always... GREER, watching the screen, addresses Maggie.
76) 2) dialog: (not looking up) Hm? Do what?
76) 4) dialog: Sure. Why not? They're getting cheaper all the time. COMMERCIAL V.0. A world where every child is secure and fulfilled...
76) 16) dialog: 
76) 18) dialog: Not like it's an issue. ON TV - the VSI LOGO. COMMERCIAL V.0. Do what you want. Be what you want. AT THE DOOR, PETERS hovers, making up her mind to enter. She steps into the room.
76) 30) dialog: Hi. I'm Maggie, Tom's wife.
76) 32) dialog: (to Greer, brightly) You should have mentioned her. I need to get going anyway, I'll let you two talk business.
96) 2) text: MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in Greer's apartment with BRIAN and a French hunk named ANDRE, who speaks with a slight ACCENT. Everyone is pretty high. Andre closes one eye, then the other, pupils turned inward. ANDRE
96) 3) text: Think my nose is too big... MAGGIE
96) 6) text: While you're at it-- I am so sick of twelve-inch dicks. MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a small JACKER, like the one we saw in the underground club. The foursome pass a single ELECTRICAL TUBE around, attached by a cord to the device. Andre and Bridget have clearly coupled up, Brian touches Maggie's leg casually from time to time. ANDRE
96) 8) text: (coming out of it) Why is that? Why do we all have to be men and women? I'd rather be-- I dunno, a lion. Or an eagle. MAGGIE
96) 10) text: A cloud? Maggie shrugs. She lifts the hair from the nape of her neck, moves the GLASS TUBE there. Brian holds her close. The ELECTRICAL ARC-- MAGGIE gasps with pleasure, transported. A moment later, Andre notices that GREER has entered quietly during the above, staring at the foursome. (CONTINUED)    
96) 12) text: Don't look now. Some homeless meatbag just wandered in. Maggie has blanked out for the moment. Bridget turns. BRIDGET
96) 13) text: That's Maggie's husband. Hi Tom. She gives him a little wave. Greer moves past them, toward the kitchen, and disappears. Maggie comes out of her trance, blinks and sighs. MAGGIE
97) 0) text: GREER has removed an old, yellowed FIRST-AID KIT from under the sink, during the scene he cleans up cuts, opens his shirt to check his bruised ribs, etc. MAGGIE
97) 2) text: Obviously. You know I don't like you jacking in the house. He finds an untouched, dusty bottle of SCOTCH, sniffs it and pours a drink. Maggie looks him over. MAGGIE
97) 3) text: Somebody beat you up? How could you go out like that? As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his injuries gently, truly concerned. Greer flinches back. MAGGIE (CONT'D)
97) 8) text: So what's his name? MAGGIE
97) 10) text: I suppose it doesn't matter. Since, as you keep telling me, it doesn't mean anything. Nothing does. Greer pours another drink. MAGGIE
98) 0) text: MAGGIE, BRIDGET, BRIAN and ANDRE are still partying-- in fact, Bridget and Andre are starting to make out-- when GREER re-enters, in a RAINCOAT, he's a little tipsy. The BOTTLE pokes out of a pocket. BRIAN
98) 5) text: Greer starts to move across the room again, heading for the door. Brian smirks, speaks quietly, thinking only the others will hear. As he touches Maggie's leg: BRIAN
98) 7) text: Excuse me. Brian turns, starts to rise. Greer grabs the man and HURLS him backwards onto the GLASS COFFEE TABLE which SHATTERS. The other three back away. After a stunned moment, Brian starts LAUGHING, very hard-- obviously, he hasn't felt a thing. MAGGIE
98) 8) text: Tom, the table! Greer steps over the couch calmly and begins PUNCHING and KICKING the surrie on the floor, working off pent-up rage. BRIAN just keeps LAUGHING. Soon Greer's hands are cut and bleeding, he's panting, exhausted. MAGGIE finally succeeds in pulling him away.- BRIAN sits up, his FACE is DENTED, the plastic skin STRETCHED and TORN. BRIAN
98) 12) text: Guess the party's over. MAGGIE follows GREER to the door. They speak in hushed TONES: (CONTINUED)    
98) 16) text: I'm sorry. I just want us to-- to connect again. To have a family, to have a life. (grabs her arms) We can't do it through this wall of plastic. MAGGIE pulls away, his BLOODY HANDS have left marks on her blouse. MAGGIE
104) 1) text: She wanted blue eyes the size of golf balls, bee-sting lips and a tiny ski-jump nose... MAGGIE
104) 3) text: Exactly. Nearby, MAGGIE works on a brown-skinned HAND. She stares through a mounted MAGNIFYING LOUPE, embedding tiny JEWELS in the SKIN of the fingers. She uses TWEEZERS and a tiny BLOWTORCH. After a moment, we realize the HAND has been disconnected from the body, mounted on a brace. MAGGIE
104) 5) text: Yes, thank God, we're doing a modified Audrey Hepburn. MAGGIE glances over at Bridget's work admiringly. MAGGIE
104) 10) text: Hiya, Tom. MAGGIE
104) 12) text: Worked late. I'd really like to sit down and talk with you. MAGGIE
104) 14) text: No, Maggie, face to face. The two of us, for real. BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable. BRIDGET
104) 15) text: These smile muscles need to set. She exits with a look at Maggie. Maggie stops working and turns to Greer, speaks passionately. MAGGIE
104) 17) text: Honey, if you're worried about the way you look-- it doesn't matter, it never did-- MAGGIE
104) 21) text: And I'm so sick of being surrounded by things-- young, beautiful things. MAGGIE
104) 23) text: Because it's bullshit. Because we're human, like it or not. MAGGIE
104) 24) text: Jesus, Tom. You sound like a Dread. Maggie turns back to what she was doing. Greer has trouble swallowing his anger. GREER
104) 25) text: I may just have to kick down your bedroom door. MAGGIE
104) 27) text: Then maybe I should just move out. MAGGIE
104) 29) text: That's a commercial. Greer turns and exits. Maggie glances after him with a mixture of anger and regret, then returns to her work. DISSOLVE TO:
134) 0) text: MAGGIE is hard at work, HOT-GLUING a new head of STREAKED HAIR around the motionless face of a BEAUTIFUL SURROGATE. She glances at a small CELLPHONE, sitting on a WORK TRAY nearby. It FLASHES-- CLOSE - "THOMAS GREER" scrolls on the CELLPHONE READOUT. MAGGIE wants to pick up, but both hands are occupied. She sighs, returns to her work.
161) 0) text: ALL EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS of the beauty shop are motionless. CAMERA FINDS MAGGIE on the floor among them, staring sightlessly at the ceiling.
170) 1) text: Maggie--? He KNOCKS gently, then tries the door-- it isn't locked.
171) 1) text: Maggie, it's me. She pulls away from his touch at first, struggles. MAGGIE
171) 2) text: No! Please no, don't look at me... Greer pulls away the covers to reveal the REAL MAGGIE. She's pale, emaciated and malnourished, tears running down her face. She shrinks away from him. MAGGIE (CONT'D)
171) 4) text: It's OK, it's OK... MAGGIE
