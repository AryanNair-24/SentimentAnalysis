10) 0) text: A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand. The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer, her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.
11) 0) text: Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a bedroom and a CRASH-- THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good- looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the
12) 0) text: RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom, gets to his feet and runs. GREER looks down from the broken window.
13) 0) text: PETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel, sees Greer is preparing to jump.
13) 2) dialog: Where'.s the sport in that?
14) 0) text: --LEAPS, GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls. He reaches the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed.
14) 8) dialog: You have the right to remain silent-- But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash, manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes. Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away, running from between buildings across a street-- WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still alive. He tries to get up, but-- GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes, points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head.
14) 9) dialog: Stay with me asshole--
16) 0) text: ON GREER'S SCANNER - "NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY," with an ID NUMBER, but no name. GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his scanner. He's angry but resigned, he was half expecting this. THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He calls out to Greer:
16) 2) dialog: (waves him off) Nah, go back to work. GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece. IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away.
16) 3) dialog: 
16) 5) dialog: He's a rental. He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY, oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck. We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away. Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and receiving impulses, they are completely inert. Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND.
18) 0) text: GREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving the body behind. He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his fingers.
18) 1) dialog: --trash pick-up on Maple and 4th.
18) 3) dialog: Any ID from the rental agency?
18) 5) dialog: 
18) 15) dialog: You think?
19) 2) dialog: Or something happened to the operator. GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head.
19) 3) dialog: Registered to a Cameron Michaels, out in Clarksburg...
19) 6) dialog: Optics are damaged.
20) 2) dialog: A tux? Kind of over-dressed for a jacker joint. GREER pulls out his scanner. BY TUXEDO's FACE, the SCANNER reads "NO SIGNAL." GREER seems surprised. PETERS looks over his shoulder.
20) 4) dialog: Little too pretty for that. GREER lifts one of Tuxedo's eyelids-- CLOSE, shattered GLASS, ELECTRONICS visible within.
20) 5) dialog: He's synth all right.
20) 7) dialog: So much for the identity chip.
20) 9) dialog: Clarksburg's just up the 270, let's talk to our witness.
20) 18) dialog: Got something better to do?
21) 0) text: GREER drives. PETERS has her eyes closed in the passenger seat. THE VOICE on the RADIO continues IN BG through scene.
21) 2) dialog: Welcome back.
21) 11) dialog: The Human Coalition isn't "the enemy."
21) 13) dialog: "Dreads..."
21) 16) dialog: Sounds like they're doing a bang-up job out there. Why'd you transfer?
21) 19) dialog: Till he retired. Had no idea he was that old.
22) 0) text: MOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex. A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows, all of which are BARRED. In this warm light, we glimpse OPERATORS in reclining chairs, motionless. They could be watching TV, but no sets are in sight. MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and pass a sign: "SURROGATE-READY UNITS AVAILABLE."
22) 8) dialog: Nothing to worry about.
22) 10) dialog: Who does?
23) 0) text: The LANDLADY undoes the MULTIPLE LOCKS on the door of a small one-room apartment. She opens it and lets GREER and PETERS inside. A RED GLOW from the far end of the room-- GREER flicks on overheads. The Landlady hovers by the door as they move into the place. It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE, contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to accomodate a curvaceous female body.
23) 1) dialog: Hello? A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech CHAIR. The two feds move quickly to see-- --CAMERON MICHAELS, a 40-ish, overweight, bald male in his underwear. BLOOD runs from his nose, his face twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR.
23) 10) dialog: Call the paramedics. While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad. ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard- core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as seen through the eyes of the BLONDE. GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and turns to look OS.
24) 10) dialog: Not cool. The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread scowls, zips up and moves away from Greer, plunks down at the end of the car. Greer pockets his badge calmly.
25) 0) text: GREER approaches an urban APARTMENT COMPLEX on foot, carrying a bag of TAKE-OUT FOOD. HIGH FENCES, SECURITY CAMERAS and SCANNERS, all commonplace in this world. We see the RED GLOW from a few windows.
26) 0) text: GREER moves tiredly down a long hallway to his apartment. He punches in a CODE at the door.
27) 0) text: GREER enters, crosses a living room that's been decorated in a spare, modern style.
28) 0) text: GREER sets the bag down on a table, fills a glass with WATER and moves down a hallway to a BEDROOM.
29) 0) text: GREER enters the bedroom, places the water glass on a bedside table beside-- --the REAL GREER. He looks five years older, twenty pounds heavier than his surrogate. He's in a STIM RECLINER, attached to a SENSORY PROJECTOR like the one we saw on Cameron Michaels. RED LIGHT suffuses the room.
30) 0) text: GREER (the real one) sits at the table in a bathrobe, finishing the food his surrogate brought home. As he empties the remains into the trash-- --MAGGIE enters. She's Greer's wife, a stylish young woman, looking ridiculously good for someone who's just gotten up. Maggie starts at the sight of Greer, begins to retreat. It's as if she's stumbled upon him in the bathroom.
30) 2) dialog: It's OK. Come in--
30) 4) dialog: Put him up. I was about to get some sleep. Maggie enters the kitchen, not looking directly at Greer. She puts some bread in a toaster, prepares coffee.
30) 6) dialog: Some poor cross-sexual had an aneurysm while he was online, had to get him to a hospital. Maggie winces, disturbed by her husband's job. She flips on a small flatscreen TV, volume low. NEWS and WEATHER.
30) 15) dialog: Bedsores? Want me to take a look?
30) 18) dialog: Well, there's room on the credit card.
30) 22) dialog: No, I just meant--
30) 24) dialog: But that's our surrogates. It's not the same...
30) 27) dialog: I was thinking more like a vacation. An island somewhere.
30) 29) dialog: I mean a real vacation-- just us. Leave our synth units home.
33) 0) text: Cluttered with papers, two desks. GREER sits before a TERMINAL, staring at his screen.
33) 1) dialog: They're uploading his memory file. Seems we're dealing with an actual homicide. PETERS, at the other (much neater) desk, leans in to look over Greer's shoulder while the file uploads.
33) 3) dialog: Well, you get a little tired of property crime, vandalism--
33) 12) dialog: What are you, quoting VSI?
33) 15) dialog: Yeah, yeah. Fact is, most of the people you refer to as Dreads are just too poor to afford a synth. You think they like living on reservations?
33) 27) dialog: Poor kid. Pathologist said his brains looked like soup.
33) 31) dialog: Two people in a narrow alley, surrounded by fire escapes, cell towers...?
33) 33) dialog: Is he the perp, or just some lookie-loo--?
33) 35) dialog: What you got?
33) 46) dialog: You still thinking lightning?
34) 0) text: Elegant, traditional decor. ARMANDO, the limousine driver from the opening sequence, is posted amidst the mirrors and plush furniture. An elegantly dressed CLERK is at the lobby desk, checking on a COMPUTER SCREEN. GREER and PETERS wait.
34) 15) dialog: is this necessary?
35) 0) text: GREER turns to ARMANDO, who's staring straight ahead.
35) 1) dialog: Kid liked the wild side, huh. Did his father know? Armando doesn't answer, this is getting too personal.
36) 0) text: THE ELEVATOR opens into a marble entrance area. It's traditional, tastefully opulent-- artwork, sculpture. A small, automated VACUUM CLEANER moves along a Persian rug. Armando moves ahead of them to announce their presence. Greer and Peters speak quietly.
36) 2) dialog: Canter must get a piece of every surrogate they sell. CANTER emerges from a study. His face is young, but there's some grey at his temples. Otherwise, he looks identical to the dead TUXEDO. GREER takes this in.
36) 3) dialog: Dr. Canter?
37) 3) dialog: I can't help noticing, your surrogate-- it's very similar to the unit your son was using... Canter pauses, then moves to a DOOR and opens it.- LIGHTS INSIDE FLICKER ON, revealing-- --a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS. Four surrogates here, all versions of the man we've just seen- Canter at different stages of life, from youth to almost elderly. Two of the charging bays are empty.
37) 15) dialog: Like getting the keys to dad's car.
37) 21) dialog: Dr. Canter-- we don't know of any way to kill an operator remotely. Do you?
37) 34) dialog: Guess the interview's over.
37) 37) dialog: Not really. You got kids?
37) 39) dialog: Lot of that going around. He starts to place the card on the desk before the immobile Canter. Armando steps forward warily-- Greer shows him the card before putting it down.
37) 40) dialog: If he thinks of anything else.
39) 0) text: GREER and PETERS move from the entrance to Canter's residential high-rise.
39) 2) dialog: Someone targeted Canter's surrie, got the wrong operator. They get to their car, parked in a RED ZONE. GREER curls his lip at a METER MAID-- a DRONE SURROGATE ON WHEELS, NO EARS, as it rolls calmly away from his car.
39) 3) dialog: I'm sure the guy's got enemies he never even heard of.
40) 0) text: MOVE OVER a DISPLAY depicting the HISTORY OF SURROGATES. MODELS are arranged chronologically, from primitive- looking, obvious ROBOTS, moving stiffly, to ANIMATED MANNEQUINS (like the landlady) to the MODERN UNITS, almost indistinguishable from human beings, whose repetitive movements are smooth, fully articulated. GREER and PETERS, in plainclothes, move past the display. Greer stops in his tracks, seeing-'-
40) 9) dialog: Damn. Why didn't I think of that? The two of them move on to an ELEVATOR BANK.
41) 0) text: A GORGEOUS ASSISTANT with plenty of cleavage enters with two cups of coffee. She takes them to GREER and PETERS, who sit at the table in this dramatic conference area.
41) 5) dialog: Just advertising the product. (sips his coffee) Ugh.
41) 7) dialog: Right, I keep forgetting that.
41) 19) dialog: Our immediate superior.
41) 26) dialog: Mm. Any idea what could cause a surrogate's head to explode from the inside? On the table, in a plastic EVIDENCE BAG, is a fried CIRCUIT-BOARD along with a pair of SHATTERED EYEBALLS. Greer passes this to Welch, who barely looks at it.
41) 36) dialog: Not much. He's dead.
41) 39) dialog: No one's talking lawsuit. we'd just like to know, is there any precedent for an operator being killed by signals from his synth unit?
41) 54) dialog: There is one more thing. The victim was Anthony Canter. The son of one of your company's founders. GREER studies them as they process this news.
41) 55) dialog: Kind of a strange coincidence.
42) 0) text: GREER and PETERS move from a glass corporate tower, across beautifully manicured gardens. GREER carries the evidence in a briefcase.
42) 2) dialog: 
42) 5) dialog: 
43) 0) text: AN OVERHEAD CONVEYOR carries PLASTIC RIBCAGES and SPINAL COLUMNS containing ELECTRONIC PARTS, FLUID SACS and TUBES. ARMS and LEGS, elaborate hydraulic apparatus, are attached by ROBOTIC ASSEMBLERS. There's no skin yet, just the exposed machinery, made mostly of plastic and microcircuitry. A WINDOW overlooks the factory floor. Here, TECHNICIANS sit at COMPUTER STATIONS, monitoring the processes below. GREER and PETERS stand before WATERS, who looks like a basketball player-- hugely tall, African-American, tattooed, in casual clothes. GREER waves a hand up in his face, trying to get his attention.
43) 1) dialog: Mr. Waters? Seth Waters? GREER checks the man's ID BADGE-- a PHOTO of a pudgy, bearded white man with glasses, the name SETH WATERS. Suddenly, WATERS snaps out of it, looks down at the two agents. Despite his appearance, his manner is nerdy.
43) 5) dialog: We're with the FBI. He studies the BADGES they hold out.
44) 11) dialog: May we take a look?
45) 0) text: WATERS opens the doors and flips on FLUORESCENT LIGHTS... they blink on to reveal-- ROW UPON ROW of SURRIE TEMPLATES, naked, hairless and robotic, not yet personalized with faces and skin. They stand packed like sardines, ready for shipment. WATERS leads GREER and PETERS to a CAGED-IN CORNER of the warehouse, unlocks the gate. Inside are STACKED BODIES in the uniforms of different SERVICES. Many are battered and scarred from battle, even in pieces. All are wrapped in CLEAR PLASTIC.
45) 12) dialog: Brand new camos, no mud, no dirt... this thing's never seen combat. Name and unit insignia removed... let me check out the motherboard.
48) 0) text: HANGARS, boxy buildings, HUMVEES, SOLDIERS marching in formation. BRANDON walks with GREER and PETERS.
48) 2) dialog: So no such thing exists?
48) 14) dialog: Not when his lips are moving. Greer shakes his head as they both get in the car. WITH BRANDON - Out of earshot of the feds, he speaks into a small earpiece.
49) 3) dialog: Sir, we are not at liberty to comment on an ongoing investigation.
49) 18) dialog: You handled that well.
49) 27) dialog: The freak who was working the door at the club. Got a look at our perp dead-on. ON SCREEN - The Assassin's features HIGHLIGHT, the words
49) 30) dialog: Eighty-seven percent match. Close enough for government work. GREER and PETERS quickly scan the man's rapsheet.
49) 32) dialog: And they let him off?
49) 34) dialog: 
50) 0) text: GREER and PETERS walk along a windowless, underground hallway, reach a SECURITY SCANNER.
50) 1) dialog: Ever come down here? It's like being inside God's head... The DOOR UNLOCKS and they enter--
51) 0) text: GREER and PETERS go down metal stairs into-a sprawling, high-tech surveillance center. COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS are arranged radially, at the hub is a central COMMAND STATION with large SCREENS facing in all directions. GREER and PETERS move toward the center. At first we see just the head and shoulders of scattered FIGURES, staring at the monitor screens. ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of SURROGATES, the Feds can have a direct surveillance feed from any surrogate's eyes. We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar-- intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex partner's face. The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES, specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have the same faces. PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work. They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS up here at once. ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry store-- packets of drugs changing hands. BOBBY eats candy, guzzles soda, waves them off for a moment, speaking rapid-fire into his HEADSET.
51) 18) dialog: They've been trying to puppet Bobby for years--
51) 27) dialog: Ten minutes ago? Where?
51) 29) dialog: 
51) 32) dialog: (on the move) Getting a chopper. Peters takes this in, calls after him:
54) 0) text: GREER is beside a PILOT, a handsome Hispanic surrie named LOPEZ. Greer shouts over the BLADE ROAR:
54) 1) dialog: We're close! Noise suppression! LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB becomes a barely audible WHIRR. We hear PETERS' VOICE over the radio:
54) 5) dialog: Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as close as you can. LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard--
57) 0) text: LOPEZ and GREER are directly overhead, watching STRICKLAND maneuver his bike quickly into the alley.
59) 0) text: GREER has seen this, horrified.
59) 1) dialog: Jesus, what is that? STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He hasn't spotted the chopper. GREER looks in the direction he's heading-- A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire, stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence. There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering, one or two people are waiting.
59) 2) dialog: He gets through the gate, we can't touch him. GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER DART into the chamber. LOPEZ maneuvers to give Greer an angle out the chopper's side.
60) 0) text: STRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as-- GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER. STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner.
61) 0) text: LOPEZ turns the bird forward to pursue, as GREER reloads. They round the corner. No sign of Strickland on the pavement. GREER looks to his left, beyond the PILOT-- STRICKLAND has scaled a fire escape, aiming the DEVICE right at Lopez. Greer sees what's about to happen--
61) 1) dialog: Pull up, Lopez, pull up!
63) 0) text: --LOPEZ is hit, his EYES FRAGMENT, shards of GLASS fly. GREER is close enough to get a partial hit, crouches in agony. SFX, an awful SCREAMING NOISE inside his head--
64) 0) text: SCREAMING NOISE CONTINUES as REAL GREER spasms in pain in his stim-chair, in the sensory projector's RED LIGHT.
66) 0) text: GREER regains his senses, just in time to see-- THE CHOPPER careening down toward the Dread encampment.
67) 0) text: THE CHOPPER CRASHES on its skids, at an angle, amidst LEAN-TOs and TENTS-- GREER is thrown out his side with the impact.
67) 10) dialog: You're a killer--
67) 12) dialog: 
67) 14) dialog: Strickland! Wait!
67) 22) dialog: I'm a federal agent--
68) 0) text: GREER lurches out of his chair, yanking the SENSORY PROJECTOR off his head-- the RED LIGHT switches to WHITE. He stumbles out of the room into the hall.
69) 0) text: GREER bangs on the door to Maggie's bedroom, rattles the knob. A RED GLOW from beneath her door.
69) 1) dialog: Maggie! Wake up! He's clearly in pain, clutches his temples. BLOOD begins to gush from his nose. Greer slides down against the door, unable to stand.
70) 0) text: THE DOOR rattles, we hear GREER calling:
70) 1) dialog: Please, I need your help... open the door! CAMERA MOVES through the RED-LIT room, to show the WIRES of a SENSORY PROJECTOR, a partial view of MAGGIE'S HEAD.
72) 0) text: MAGGIE almost trips over GREER, unconscious on the floor.
74) 0) text: A pleasant, rustic home. JENNIFER PETERS, somewhat less perfect than her surrie, disconnects from her SENSORY PROJECTOR. She looks concerned, very tired. She rises from her stim chair and moves into a kitchen. PULL BACK - we're watching her through a WINDOW, with a very large and powerful-looking STALKER, LATER - PETERS in bed, fast asleep. A SHADOW crosses her doorway, but moves on. AT HER sensory PROJECTOR, the STALKER is SCANNING through her hard-drive's memory. ON SCREEN - fast-forwarding rapidly through PETERS' POV, we see GREER in the alley with the fallen SURRIES...
76) 0) text: CLOSE ON A MEDICAL MONITOR - high-tech imaging of a HUMAN BRAIN. MOVE DOWN to find GREER (the real one), asleep. An IV, BLEEPING monitors. Uneaten LUNCH on a tray. MAGGIE, her surrogate that is, sits in a chair beside the bed, her hand resting on GREER's. He stirs-- she pulls her hand back, returns to her fashion magazine. A TV plays above his bed, Greer blinks, squints at this. ON TV - a small BOY CLIMBS a very tall TREE above a suburban sidewalk, pleasant MUSIC. Suddenly, a BRANCH BREAKS, the boy tumbles with a CRY. GREER winces distastefully. ON TV - now we see the BOY again, perfectly fine, standing beside his mother. She strokes his head with a smile. They look down at his broken SURROGATE on the ground beside the fallen BRANCH. COMMERCIAL V.0. Imagine a world where children are safe. Always... GREER, watching the screen, addresses Maggie.
76) 1) dialog: Would you do that?
76) 3) dialog: Get a surrogate for our kid. Our hypothetical kid.
76) 15) dialog: It just seems weird to me.
76) 20) dialog: Who's there.-
76) 29) dialog: (almost to himself) I thought you might've been telling another joke. Peters seems relieved. Maggie waits for an introduction, but Greer seems withdrawn, shy-- Peters has never seen his physical body.
76) 36) dialog: Except older and fatter. Sorry if I seem a little out of it.
76) 38) dialog: They're calling it a concussion-- felt like my head was going to explode. With a brisk RAP on the doorframe, STONE enters.
76) 47) dialog: You tell me. How's Lopez? Stone sighs, looking him over. Quietly:
76) 52) dialog: None of us did! We still don't know. I don't think Strickland even knew-- he thought he was just taking down "the abominations."
76) 54) dialog: I've been going through my memory files of the crash... ever seen anything like this before? ON SCREEN - a magnified CLOSE-UP of the DEVICE in STRICKLAND'S HAND, as he points it upward at the helicopter.
76) 64) dialog: We need to get this guy.
76) 67) dialog: (nervous, thrown) They said the end of the week--
76) 70) dialog: What about my surrogate?
77) 0) text: PETERS strides from the doors, GREER follows, dressed in casual clothes... then slows his pace, breathing hard. GREER'S POV - CARS zipping past on the street, RUSHING PEDESTRIANS, PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney. From Greer's now human perspective, surrogates seem artificial, appearance too perfect, eyes empty of souls. This should be reeling, vertiginous. PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He has trouble speaking.
77) 1) dialog: I haven't been out without a surrogate in a long time...
77) 3) dialog: They wanted to give me something for the anxiety... they call it corporeaphobia.
77) 5) dialog: Jesus Christ.
78) 0) text: A low-end place, BODIES displayed in the windows in their charging bays, SIGNS reading "HURRY 4 A SURRY! GIANT SALE! SYNTH UNITS NEW &amp; USED!" PETERS guides GREER inside.
79) 0) text: COFFIN-SIZED BOXES, SENSORY PROJECTORS and STIM CHAIRS stacked willy-nilly. BRIGHT LIGHTS, VIDEO SCREENS running PROMOS. A slick, blond Aryan SALESMAN approaches with a grin. He sizes GREER up, instantly recognizing signs of withdrawal. He speaks with an incongruous ASIAN ACCENT.
79) 2) dialog: I like to see my own face when I look in the mirror.
79) 29) dialog: No. I'm a grown man for Chrissake, I should be able to walk down the street without completely freaking out.
80) 0) text: A BARTENDER puts a SODA WATER and a GLASS OF SCOTCH on the bar in front of PETERS and the shaky GREER.
80) 2) dialog: (lifts his glass) Here's to self-medication. He takes a sip and spits it out. The BARTENDER turns.
80) 4) dialog: What is this? The BARTENDER gives him a once-over.
80) 6) dialog: You have any real booze?
80) 16) dialog: You know, they really don't look human. You can't tell when you're inside them, but... GREER turns to PETERS, studies her like the others.
80) 18) dialog: But I'm not really looking at you.
80) 20) dialog: I'd like that. PETERS blinks, Greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her. He looks away.
80) 21) dialog: You know, when we started working together, I thought you were kind of a stiff.
80) 23) dialog: It's more than that... you're different. Or maybe I am. Greer's embarrassed, shrugs it off. He puts down a bill and rises.
80) 24) dialog: You probably oughta head back to the office.
80) 33) dialog: I'll be OK. He moves toward the door, she tags along.
80) 34) dialog: I'm thinking you should double- check Strickland's records, go back to the hard copies. See if you can find out why they dropped charges.
80) 36) dialog: It's like riding a bike.
81) 0) text: subway, GREER and PETERS walk, he spots a sign for the changes direction to head for the escalator.
81) 2) dialog: It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take a trip to East Baltimore. He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo.
81) 3) dialog: Was it always this steep?
81) 5) dialog: Since I'm stuck in my skin, I oughta take advantage of it. Hell, as long as Strickland has that device-- I'm safer this way. He clutches the handrail, starts moving down.
83) 12) dialog: I'm sure.
84) 0) text: Late afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE SURROGATE, built into the seat.
84) 2) dialog: Just a little carsick. The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE.
85) 0) text: AT THE GATE: METAL SIGNS read "HUMANS ONLY - NO SURROGATES." GREER goes through a big,.old-fashioned (present-day) METAL DETECTOR, the light flashes GREEN. A DREAD GUARD waves him past. Greer gestures toward one of the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez.

86) 0) text: GREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant neighborhood-- rowhouses, gardens. Very few cars. DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks. A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking. Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself. A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN.

He stands before a platform atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the gathered throng of DREADS.
88) 8) text: Who are you? GREER

88) 18) text: No, that's OK. With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form should have a very different, painfully visceral feel, unlike when he was a surrogate.] (CONTINUED)

88) 22) text: It's a bitch being real. GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving his head into the man's torso, knocking the wind out of him before the other two can pull Greer back. ADAMS
88) 24) text: (catching his breath) So give him some more. Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating, continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's limp in their arms. Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets, examines them. As he does so, GREER spits BLOOD on the man's face. Miller seems about to whomp him again, but stops himself. MILLER (CONT'D)
88) 25) text: Not gonna give you the satisfaction. (to Bud and Adams) Get him out of here. Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the RV, leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and Adams, lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre.

94) 5) text: To kill someone remotely-- it would take a virus presumably, one that could get past every firewall protecting a surrie's circuitry-- then once in the CPU, override all the fail-safes and cause catastrophic brain damage... GREER
94) 11) text: Maybe that's exactly where you should be looking. Greer takes a second to absorb this. GREER

A moment later, Andre notices that GREER has entered quietly during the above, staring at the foursome. (CONTINUED)

97) 3) text: Somebody beat you up? How could you go out like that? As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his injuries gently, truly concerned. Greer flinches back. MAGGIE (CONT'D)

98) 2) text: Can I ask you something? Is it true you guys are tapping into our surries? Watching everything we do, twenty-four seven? GREER (A BEAT)
98) 5) text: Greer starts to move across the room again, heading for the door. Brian smirks, speaks quietly, thinking only the others will hear. As he touches Maggie's leg: BRIAN
98) 6) text: Wouldn't want him spying on us tonight... Greer spins near the door and, without breaking stride, returns to the couch. GREER
98) 7) text: Excuse me. Brian turns, starts to rise. Greer grabs the man and HURLS him backwards onto the GLASS COFFEE TABLE which SHATTERS. The other three back away. After a stunned moment, Brian starts LAUGHING, very hard-- obviously, he hasn't felt a thing. MAGGIE
98) 8) text: Tom, the table! Greer steps over the couch calmly and begins PUNCHING and KICKING the surrie on the floor, working off pent-up rage. BRIAN just keeps LAUGHING. Soon Greer's hands are cut and bleeding, he's panting, exhausted. MAGGIE finally succeeds in pulling him away.- BRIAN sits up, his FACE is DENTED, the plastic skin STRETCHED and TORN. BRIAN
98) 11) text: I was getting sick of it, anyway. As Brian picks bits of GLASS out of his plastic flesh, Andre suddenly realizes his JACKER is SMASHED, examines the pieces with a MOAN. GREER

102) 6) text: No. Of course not. Greer studies her a beat, decides she's sincere. A sigh. Peters sits on his desk, studies him. PETERS (CONT'D)
102) 7) text: You look terrible. GREER
102) 8) text: Not half as bad as I feel. Greer refills his coffee cup with Scotch, holds the bottle out to her questioningly. PETERS
102) 9) text: No thanks. GREER
102) 10) text: Come on. Just pretend to get drunk with me. Peters shakes her head with a smile. Greer shrugs, takes a long drink, sighs and rubs his sore neck. GREER (CONT'D)
102) 11) text: Feel like I've been asleep for years-- now I wake up an old man. Rip Van Frigging Winkle... Peters moves behind him, begins rubbing his shoulders, a massage. GREER (CONT'D)

102) 25) text: Maybe not. I have a feeling people are going to come to their senses eventually. GREER
102) 26) text: (shaking his head) You can't unring a bell. (turns toward her) Thought you were the one all into the brave new world. PETERS is staring at her own plastic hand. She looks up at Greer, changes the subject. PETERS
102) 30) text: The case files were removed, but there was a paper trail from payroll... Strickland was an informant. GREER (PERKING UP)
102) 32) text: Wasn't in the paperwork. But he must've been selling intel on the Prophet. Greer has risen, moving restlessly around the room. GREER
103) 1) text: Where'd you get this photo? GREER sits opposite COLONEL BRANDON at the man's desk, a FLAG and other MILITARY MEMORABILIA on display. Greer eyes the colonel, knows something's up. GREER

103) 6) text: If this is true... we're going to have to do everything in our-power to recover it. Do you have any idea how serious this is? GREER
103) 8) text: This is absolutely off the record. (off Greer's nod) It's called an Overload Device, or O.D. They're brand new, only a handful exist. But I checked, ran every serial number-- all accounted for. GREER
103) 10) text: It's a DARPA design, subcontracted to Pierson Defense. The idea was to create a non-lethal weapon that could disable every surrie in the field. You beam a software virus straight to the CPU. The fail-safes kick in and the operators are cut off. Circuits all melt down in seconds, you're left with a field full of scrap. GREER
103) 13) text: Just a few lines of code, the connection stays open. We tried it on soldier volunteers... once. The virus caused every neuron to fire at the same time. Melted their brains. GREER

104) 18) text: Exactly! What matters is who I choose to be. As the conversation gets more heated, co-workers pointedly turn away, while eavesdropping. GREER
104) 22) text: Well that's your problem, isn't it. if you can be young and beautiful and feel good all the time-- why would anyone choose anything else? GREER
104) 24) text: Jesus, Tom. You sound like a Dread. Maggie turns back to what she was doing. Greer has trouble swallowing his anger. GREER
104) 26) text: (not looking up) I'd never forgive you. GREER
104) 28) text: Do what you want... GREER (A BEAT)
104) 29) text: That's a commercial. Greer turns and exits. Maggie glances after him with a mixture of anger and regret, then returns to her work. DISSOLVE TO:

107) 6) text: GREER sits back, frustrated. PETERS
107) 7) text: What does AOS stand for? I keep coming across it on these invoices. "Advance On Salary?" Greer thinks- a moment of revelation. He moves to look over Peters' shoulder. GREER
107) 10) text: 'Course, since he owns the patents on surrogate technology, they must have to pay him billions. GREER
107) 12) text: Wait a minute. You think VSI hired Strickland to kill Canter? GREER

109) 11) text: Are you done with this paranoid fantasy--? GREER
109) 12) text: Not quite. What I can't figure out is why. Why kill Canter? STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to his desk, types into his COMPUTER. Greer approaches slowly. STONE
109) 15) text: Greer slips a LETTER OPENER off of Stone's desk as he nears. His hand is SHAKING. Suddenly-- --STONE yanks open a DRAWER and lunges for a GUN. But before he can bring it to bear-- --GREER STABS him in the back of the head, SKEWERING STONE'S CPU. STONE FREEZES, hunched over his desk, gun in hand. Greer just stares at what he's done for a moment, amazed. Then he waves a hand in front of Stone's open eyes, makes sure he's out, and-- --carefully pries off a plate and removes STONE'S MOTHERBOARD, places it on the desk. GREER pulls the gun out of Stone's hand, rolls him back in front of his desk, propped up to face the computer. Greer crouches behind him, operating the keyboard by reaching around his boss' body. ON COMPUTER - Greer types in a request for a FILE on LIONEL CANTER. The words "CLASSIFIED - IDENTITY SCAN REQUIRED" appear. GREER pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer, ducking down, lifts Stone's head by the hair. The monitor momentarily displays STONE'S FACE. A LIGHT goes on in the corner of the FRAME, scanning Stone. "AUTHORIZED USER" appears. GREER peeks up again, continuing his work. ON SCREEN - a HEADSHOT OF CANTER, reams of CLASSIFIED INFO.

134) 0) text: MAGGIE is hard at work, HOT-GLUING a new head of STREAKED HAIR around the motionless face of a BEAUTIFUL SURROGATE. She glances at a small CELLPHONE, sitting on a WORK TRAY nearby. It FLASHES-- CLOSE - "THOMAS GREER" scrolls on the CELLPHONE READOUT. MAGGIE wants to pick up, but both hands are occupied. She sighs, returns to her work.
136) 0) text: GREER, face red, out of breath, is displaying his badge to the CLERK, who checks his computer. (CONTINUED)

136) 4) text: I see... do you have a warrant? GREER
136) 6) text: Without a warrant, I'm afraid I can't help you. ARMANDO takes Greer by the arm in a painful grip. ARMANDO
136) 7) text: You're gonna have to leave, sir. Armando escorts Greer none too gently to the door. GREER
136) 8) text: Ow! Easy, I'm only human. As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left arm-- then gasps and clutches his chest, as if having a coronary. He stumbles, falls to his knees. Armando bends over him-- ARMANDO
136) 9) text: Are you OK? Greer suddenly thrusts his hand beneath the man's jacket. Armando reacts, begins to struggle with Greer-- BANG BANG beneath his suitcoat. Armando's ARM SPASMS WILDLY. He takes a few steps back, SPARKS and HYDRAULIC FLUID coming from his chest. GREER is holding the man's GUN now, aimed at him. ARMANDO (CONT'D)
136) 10) text: You asshole. I just made the last payment. GREER rises and hurries to the CLERK, points the gun at his head. (CONTINUED)    
136) 13) text: I'm calling the police. The CLERK goes stock still, he's checked out-- he's obviously making the call from home. Greer shoves the inert body aside, it falls flat. He reaches for the elevator key, snatches it up when-- ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from behind, choking him. They stagger backward, GREER aims the gun behind his head and FIRES, blowing a HOLE in Armando's forehead. GREEN COOLANT, FRIED ELECTRONICS fly from the exit wound. They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from the frozen surrie's grip, clutching his ear, deafened by the gun's loud report. As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in the tableau-- the gun-wielding man, the two surries on the ground-- and dashes outside again. GREER hurries for CANTER'S PRIVATE ELEVATOR. He turns the key-- no light, nothing. He makes a frustrated NOISE and dashes for a nearby door to the stairwell.

138) 2) text: THE BULLET RICOCHETS about the narrow area, scaring the hell out of him. The LOCK is intact. GREER
141) 0) text: GREER has come out on the roof. There's an enormous CELL TOWER and DISH up here. He moves to the edge, peers over warily. ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street. GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves along the edge, looking for something. ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop. GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge, trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the momentum going the right way-- --but his grip gives a moment too soon-- GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way. But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back. HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn, blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion.

146) 0) text: GREER has almost given up hope when he starts at a noise and spins, ready to shoot at-- --the AUTOMATED VACUUM humming around a corner. As it moves past his feet, Greer registers-- --a thin strip of RED LIGHT at floor level. After a moment, he begins rapping at the wall, realizing it's false.
148) 0) text: GREER hears FOOTSTEPS of the approaching cops as he tries desperately to find a way into the hidden space. He discovers a LATCH at waist level, the wall becomes a pocket door. He lets himself in and closes it behind him JUST AS--
149) 0) text: Eerie RED LIGHT, a narrow, snaking passageway. GREER listens as the FOOTSTEPS pass outside, turns to see-- THE STALKER-- the hulking, silver-eyed surrogate who broke into Peters' place. He's inert in his CHARGING BAY. Beside him is the BOY who picked Greer up in the limo. (CONTINUED)    
149) 2) text: WIDER, a dozen SURROGATES, different ages and sexes, lined up in their charging bays. Clearly, Canter can become anyone he wants to be. GREER is momentarily stunned to see-- THE PROPHET, a spare surrogate, in a charging bay. GREER moves carefully onward. Around a corner, he sees-- --a PROJECTOR DISPLAY SCREEN. It's PETERS' POV on the FBI SURVEILLANCE CENTER, a glance toward the motionless RIOT AGENTS, to BOBBY struggling on the ground. PETERS' POV SETTLES on the numbers HIGHLIGHTING on the terminal. THE 0. D. is connected to the keyboard, BLUE DIODES FLASH, the jerry-rigging complete. REAL CANTER is visible from behind in an elaborate prosthetic WHEELCHAIR, a SENSORY PROJECTOR on his head. GREER moves toward him and RIPS OFF the headgear. REAL CANTER opens his eyes, startled. GREER

151) 11) text: There's nothing you can do-- GREER PUSHES CANTER'S WHEELCHAIR out of the way violently. Greer sits on the floor, leaning against the wall. He takes a breath and puts on the PROJECTOR HEADSET. He slips on the FINGERSLEEVE, presses his fingers together and--

152) 6) text: OK... the software from that thing's already in the system, you have to abort transmission. PETERS/GREER (DESPERATE)

155) 3) text: You know why. I won't be responsible for the death of humanity. I like the way you put it-- unringing a bell. GREER puts his head in his hands, realizing the enormity of what he's just done. GREER
155) 6) text: I only sought to give people like me the chance to live normal lives. But my partners at VSI overrode me. They saw a much larger market-- surrogates for everyone. Healthy people. Children. A world without risk, without pain. Without feelings. Nothing at stake. Nothing to live for. Greer rises shakily. GREER
155) 8) text: The day of resurrection. As he speaks, he raises a small white capsule to his lips. GREER

165) 0) text: GREER hobbles through the dreadful aftermath-- SMOKING AUTO PILEUPS, BODIES everywhere, most fallen in their tracks, a few remain on their feet. CAR HORNS, ALARMS in the distance. - A few disheveled DREADS are here, taking it in with delight and amazement. They WHOOP as they TIP OVER a couple of the standing surries. GREER passes a CAR on the sidewalk, its DRIVER slumped against the wheel-- the RADIO BLARES: RADIO VOICE

172) 0) text: --OUT THE WINDOW. MOVE to show exterior DOORS OPENING and GREER'S NEIGHBORS EMERGING, blinking in the unfamiliar sunlight. Most wear robes, sweatclothes. They're all ages, some overweight, others homely-- it's almost a relief after all the young, perfect people. DOWN THE STREET, OTHERS EMERGE, regard each other warily, like people after an earthquake. Some begin speaking to each other for the first time, in whispers at first, others take in the SUNSET which bathes the neighborhood in orange light. FADE TO BLACK.
