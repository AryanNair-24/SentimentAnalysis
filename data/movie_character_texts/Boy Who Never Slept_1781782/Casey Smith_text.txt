Well, heave you've ever read or heard  about the LSD experiments the  government did?  They experimented  on some their top scientists without  their knowledge.  They were dosed  with an insanely high amount and  tripped for like a week.  Afterwards  they returned to their normal jobs  and continued working for the  government, except for one guy, who  went completely insane and then tried  to sue the government for causing  his mental illness.  He tried to  kill everyone that turned completely  homicidal.  My mother works as a  nurse at Precious Heart Hospital and  the third floor is completely devoted  to mental patients that can't come  back into society and most of them  are former drug addicts.  People  that abuse meth really bad can go  into a homicidal psychosis  permanently, where they are always  trying to kill random people and  have delusions of persecution.
