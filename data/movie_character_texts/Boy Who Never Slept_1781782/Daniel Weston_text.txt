43) 10) dialog: Doesn't it make you stupid?
43) 12) dialog: Yeah, but I don't think it's worth  the bad things It can do.
43) 14) dialog: Crazy, you definitely don't make it  sound very appealing.
43) 16) dialog: No thanks. I've talked to too many  hippy fucks who try to tell me  everything they've learned from  tripping. It usually consists of  seeing how it's all energy that comes  up from the ground and flows through  everything, cause everything is  connected and that they've learned  so much, but can't describe it. I'm  like OK, you've learned nonsense...  great.
43) 18) dialog: It was great actually.  She's a really  cool girl.
43) 20) dialog: No... and I don't want to right away.   I really like this girl.
43) 22) dialog: Haha...
43) 24) dialog: (Laughing) You're a fucking pervert.
44) 0) text: Daniel sits on his bed, writing rapidly.
44) 2) dialog: Slowly running my hand over her face,  the tips pressing ever so softly  against her skin, from her lips, to  her neck, to her chest... over her  belly and down to her... (sigh) Gazing into her eyes, enveloped in  utter stillness, thrust against her  skin, stillness...kisses, lips parted  slightly as my tongue caresses the  soft warmth of her tender neck. The  small quivers of skin, eruptions  spilling gently against my fingers  as I run them across her naked back,  hands exploring the intricacies of  her soul. Long kisses... hot, as I  press my lower lip against her skin,  moving slowly, building into fast,  deep kisses that touch every inch of  her body. Moaning, clenched in my  arms... hot... sweaty... hard, then  soft... the shock and vibration of  her body as I stroke her to  distraction, continuing the rhythm,  with every thrust slowly increasing,  harder... faster... eyes locked...  building... skin inflamed... hot,  scorching, no release... then...  ahhhhhhhh, ecstasy, sweet, hot and  intense.  When you're lying in post- coital sweat, every fiber of your  body screaming with exquisite  sensitivity , drained, the muscles  relaxed, poured onto the bed as the  breath steadies, lying next to  perfection... then, my friend, you've  found heaven.
44) 3) text: Daniel smiles.  He looks down at his writing again.
44) 6) dialog: (Softly, smiling to  himself) Well it's quite obvious I'm a horny  bastard.
45) 0) text: Daniel and MELISSA are running around having fun and bein goofy.
45) 1) dialog: Have you seen Dirty Dancing?
45) 3) text: They continue to play around. They are laughing and havin fun. Melissa runs and jumps on Daniel he isn't ready and  almost falls over and they are unsuccessful.  They both l
45) 4) dialog: Wait, you have to warn me first OK?   Let's try it slowly this time.
45) 6) text: They try again.  She doesn't balance right and again they fall over, laughing. They go over to a tree. Daniel helps Melissa climb; she h trouble.
45) 7) dialog: Ok, put your foot here. Now pull.   Good.
45) 9) dialog: Yes you can. I've got you. Push.   Higher. Come on. I've got you. Use  some upper body strength.
45) 12) text: She continues to dangle. Daniel laughs, watching, and sma her bottom. They laugh again. It's obvious they're having fun. FADE TO BLACK.
46) 0) text: Daniel and Melissa are hanging out. They are sitting on  Daniel's bed. Melissa is holding the script for Harmony.
46) 2) dialog: That was supposed to be the most  powerful part. The realization that  all his problems, all his hate, and  everything that was combined and  traced out towards the world is really  a reflection of his own cruelty rather  than the cruelty of the world. The  metaphor of the demon being a young  version of himself.
46) 4) dialog: You should help me write something.
46) 6) dialog: UM... help me with some ideas.
46) 8) dialog: (teasingly) Give me some crazy ideas. I know  you're a literature nut.
46) 10) dialog: That would be cool... how do you  know so much about publishing and  editing and stuff?
46) 12) text: Daniel is surprised.
46) 13) dialog: Crazy. How come you never mentioned  that before?
46) 15) dialog: Hmm.  I need to write something  bigger; better than Harmony.
46) 17) dialog: I want something... I'm a  perfectionist. I hate reading my own  work.
46) 19) dialog: When I read something like that, I  think 'ah, this is horrible' which  is normal, I guess. I know its okay,  but its not what I want.
46) 21) dialog: Where did that come from?
46) 23) dialog: Just thoughts, huh? There are a lot  of things I look at. How they're  body moves, how they move their  hands... but mostly their eyes. Their  eyes show if they're in pain happy,  or sad; if they're anxious or they  want something. Get an in depth look  at their personality.
46) 25) dialog: Yes, and a lot more.
46) 27) dialog: I see beauty, and innocence, and a  die-hard romantic... but you are  kind of hard to read.
46) 29) dialog: You just are. I don't make the rules.  Why are you laughing?
46) 31) dialog: And much more... what's your biggest  fear Melissa?
46) 33) dialog: I guarantee that won't happen...
46) 35) dialog: Well for one thing, hormones and  nature will make you fall in love  sometime no matter what...
46) 37) dialog: If you put two people on an island  with no one else they'll fall in  love.  Nature has a part in love too  you know.  But it's not a bad thing..  nature is beautiful, love is  beautiful.  I just understand how it  works.  Nature is a catalyst... for  your feelings... it doesn't create  your feelings... but it can help you  realize them.  Does that makes sense?
46) 39) text: Daniel smiles.
46) 41) dialog: It's not silly, it's cute. You're  cute.
46) 43) dialog: Being alone... like ending up alone.
46) 45) dialog: Yeah, but being in love doesn't mean  you won't be alone... the only thing  that really exists is the moment  right now... that's my biggest fear...  being trapped in fleeting moments  where all I can think about is how  much I love someone and not being  able to express it... being forever  alone...no one to care about or share  myself with... I hate being alone.
46) 47) dialog: Why's that?
46) 49) dialog: Oh god, please don't say that.
46) 51) dialog: You just called me a nice guy.
46) 53) dialog: Girls don't like nice guys
46) 55) text: Melissa leans over and kisses Daniel softly on the cheek.
46) 57) dialog: Once.
46) 59) dialog: Yeah.
46) 61) dialog: She was very career oriented, which  is cool, but I was still an undergrad  and she graduated and was going to  leave for grad school. I had to stay  and finish my degree. I don't do  long distance relationships, so it  was goodbye. I don't want someone  without ambition, but I do want  someone who will support me and will  make decisions in our best interest.  And at the time I didn't plan on  being suck in this same city.
46) 63) dialog: Still waiting for my inspiration. I  am going to write something incredible  someday.
46) 65) dialog: She moved, met someone else, and got  married.
46) 67) dialog: Well, she's a little older than me,  so it was probably her "time."
46) 69) dialog: Two years.
46) 71) dialog: Sarah.
46) 73) dialog: I'll always love her. I think if you  really love someone that your feelings  will never go away.
46) 75) dialog: Of course not.  I think it's hot.   What's sexier then a beautiful young  girl.
46) 77) dialog: Oh, come on now... I love how you  look at me, how you talk, the  excitement in your eyes when we talk  about playing tag on moon... why  would you ask me that?
46) 79) dialog: (softly) Melissa...
46) 81) dialog: Can I kiss you?
46) 82) text: Melissa looks into Daniel's eyes.  He slowly moves his fi to the side of her face.  He runs them down her neck and  slowly on to her chest. Melissa closes her eyes, then opens them and looks excite but slightly nervous. Daniel leans forward and kisses her.  They pull apart,  smiling.
46) 84) dialog: I like you too.
47) 2) text: Casey moves a little closer to Daniel and looks at him.   Daniel smiles and has a funny grin.
47) 3) dialog: What do you mean?
47) 5) dialog: Glowing? What?
47) 7) dialog: No. Well, not yet anyway.
47) 9) dialog: I'm not, I really like this girl.
47) 11) dialog: We talk about everything and nothing  at the same time.

50) 8) dialog: What would happen if your parents  found out about me?
50) 10) dialog: But what would happen if they did?
52) 0) text: Daniel is drinking an energy drink and staring into a not book.  He is attacking it with the pen and writing very  rapidly.  He stops, looks around, smiles and continues to write. FADE TO BLACK.

56) 5) dialog: (interrupting) Melissa's pregnant.  Fuck man, what  the fuck am I going to do? (pacing back and forth  nervously)
56) 7) dialog: That's what she told me... my life's  over.  She's mad at me, her parents  are going to find out... I'm going  to jail... I'm a fucking idiot.
56) 9) dialog: Why do you keep saying that?
56) 11) dialog: Well, Melissa isn't like that.

66) 9) dialog: She was an angel, about to get her  first taste of mortality, the  realization that it wouldn't last  forever.  That incredible feeling...  that you're free.
