37) 0) text: Girl is SARAH. Daniel and Sarah are walking together, but not too close.
38) 1) dialog: Why are you still here?  You graduated  two years ago.  Shouldn't you be  moving on?
38) 3) dialog: Don't wait too long.  So how was  your weekend?  Did you go out?
38) 5) dialog: Is that good?
38) 7) dialog: Ahh. Okay.
38) 9) dialog: I'm sure.  So nothing came of that?
38) 11) dialog: Interesting enough to what?
38) 13) dialog: Um... thanks.
38) 15) dialog: Yes you did.  But that's okay. You  can care about someone, even love  them, and not be 'in' love with them  or 'blown away.'
38) 17) dialog: Right. Anyway, it would be hard to  know what your feelings really are  without spending time in the flesh.
38) 19) dialog: Mmmm.  Apparently it's not, because  as you say, you have no problem with  that area.
38) 21) dialog: Maybe, but only a little part.
38) 23) dialog: We're fine.
38) 25) dialog: Thanks, we are. Stop trying to change  the subject. Why haven't you met  Melissa yet?
38) 27) dialog: That's odd... don't you guys talk  all the time?
38) 29) dialog: What things?
38) 31) dialog: No wonder she doesn't want to meet  you right away.
38) 33) dialog: Right.  Then you'll start drinking  and call her and all this shit will  come out and you won't even remember  what you said to her.
38) 35) dialog: Yeah. Famous last words, Daniel.
38) 37) dialog: Promised who? You even used to call  me drunk.
38) 39) dialog: You used call me and beg me to live  with you, kiss you..., all that stuff.
38) 41) dialog: If I had a boyfriend who was doing  that. You have a habit of doing this  and not just in isolated incidents.
38) 43) dialog: No more whacked out phone calls,  obviously. And honestly, I would  want to meet her in person, to try  and see if your feelings are real  and if she feels the same. You'll  gain a much clearer and accurate  idea of the situation and the type  of relationship that may exist between  the two of you, in the real world,  not virtual land.  Now, there is a  huge risk in that, because what if  they are real and she still doesn't  feel the same for you?  It will hurt  like a bitch, but at least you'll  know, and you can stop putting  yourself out there.  Even though  that's a worst case scenario, there  is a positive side to it, because  you will definitely get closure either  way.
38) 45) dialog: I think she does; she's just nervous.  Just explain it to her the way I've  explained it to you. If she really  cares about you as a true friend,  and not some trophy who is infatuated  with her, then she'll want to do  whatever she can to help salvage the  friendship while still respecting  your honest feelings for her.
38) 47) dialog: Okay, let's get your terminology  right first.  You won't be "taking  her out" you'll be "meeting" her.   It's the difference between sounding  sleazy and sounding decent.  Those  are the little things that freak  girls out.
38) 50) dialog: My husband's waiting for me, but  it's been fun catching up with you,  and I'm sure we'll see each other  around. (teasingly) Since you're here.
38) 52) dialog: (smiling) No problem.
38) 55) dialog: You too.
38) 58) dialog: Yeah, you too, good bye.
38) 59) text: Sarah walks away and Daniel sits there alone for awhile,  thinking. He looks a little pathetic.
