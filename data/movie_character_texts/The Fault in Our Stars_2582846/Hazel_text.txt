0) 450) dialog: Um, no.
0) 469) dialog: "Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears.
0) 471) dialog: (beat, composing herself) "I can't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I love you." Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO: BLACK. Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.
0) 489) dialog: He loved you so much too. More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a d breath, wills herself to walk towards it. Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee. Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catc herself.
0) 490) dialog: It's ok, you hear me? It's ok. She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around. Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lig and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining o the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.
0) 500) dialog: I was his girlfriend. Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.
0) 501) dialog: There's a beautiful quote in Gus's home that reads "if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain." Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:
0) 505) dialog: I'll be fine.
0) 507) dialog: No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for a while. Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking l As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.
0) 510) dialog: How did you even --
0) 512) dialog: And you just... bought a ticket?

0) 535) dialog: You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. We had an awesome trip.
0) 537) dialog: You think I care about that? I don't give a shit, Van Houten. Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.
0) 538) dialog: You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. And I'd like you to get out of my car right now so I can go home and grieve.
0) 542) dialog: Get out of the car! Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He sta there as Hazel peels out. In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT
0) 548) dialog: 
0) 557) dialog: He was really fighting for breath, I guess. He eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything. Dying sucks.
0) 560) dialog: Happens all the time.

0) 565) dialog: I know.
0) 567) dialog: I know.
