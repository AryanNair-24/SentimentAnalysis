36) 2) dialog: Don't. I tried to wake him once, he nearly took my head off. Let's give him a few minutes.... (realizes) What are you doing out this late? Walter shrugs innocently. They sit on a rise, overlooking the lake. Hub stands there, motionless. The wind BLOWS.

There was no way he'd let any challenge pass. It became a race.... The two ride at breathless speed, flat-out, neck and neck GARTH (Cont'd) Many considered Hub the finest horseman in North Africa. He'd never lost a horse race, not one. But this rider stayed right with him, neck and neck, as the race went on and on. And on. Hub looks at the mysterious rider in wonder GARTH (Cont'd) Then: a horse stumbled, the horses collided, and both riders flew into the sea. Hub leapt up, his sword drawn, ready for anything. So he thought. He wasn't ready at all for what he saw next.... Hub pulls his sword, whirls... stares: the rider sits up out of the sea, disguise gone, water streams from her long black hair. She meets Hub's eyes, smiles, and LAUGHS GARTH (Cont'd) She was the Princess. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was....
46) 21) dialog: Now most people don't believe in such things nowadays: they say it's something you only find in stories. But when those two first laid eyes on each other, it was honest-to-god, no-kidding, sure- enough, once-in-a-lifetime... "Love At First Sight". MUSIC SWELLS. The horses caper and court in the surf behind the couple who have eyes only for each other.
46) 24) dialog: Aren't you jumping ahead of the story?
46) 26) dialog: Well... Things weren't easy for them, back then: they were from different worlds. She was from a royal family, her father a Sultan. But none of that mattered to them. They arranged often, to meet....
46) 30) dialog: They made plans to run away together. But there was one big problem: she was promised to another man, a powerful Sheik from a nearby kingdom, an evil Sheik who wore a patch over one eye.
46) 32) dialog: Surprisingly, despite his ruthless ways, the evil Sheik was said to be quite young and handsome....
46) 36) dialog: The evil Sheik heard Jasmine loved another: he threatened her father to hand Jasmine over at once, for their wedding to take place that very night. Her father had no choice. And so the evil Sheik took Jasmine off to his kingdom and locked her away in his harem.

46) 43) dialog: As they galloped for the gates of the city, there was only one horseman brave enough to stand in their way: the Sheik.
46) 45) dialog: It was a thrilling battle on horseback, between two expert swordsmen... but Hub drew first blood, a mighty stroke that cut a big long scar down the side of the sheik's once-handsome face. After a short but thrilling swordfight, Hub and Jasmine race through the gates, toward the desert and freedom. GARTH (Cont'd) They galloped away, got married, and lived together happily ever after. The End.
46) 51) dialog: Nurse! What's going on? (she hurries off) I wish somebody'd tell us something! Anxious, both turn to Hub's doorway. Suddenly, medical supplies fly out of the room, SMASH against the wall.

48) 12) dialog: I don't know.
48) 14) dialog: Maybe there's still things worth living for, brother... BURP! Startled, Hub and Garth look over at Walter: he grins, embarrassed, his face smeared with grease.
50) 7) dialog: Hub: he's just a dumb kid. Don't kill him. The punks LAUGH. Frankie takes a fighting stance. (CONTINUED)

50) 24) dialog: Son, you need all the help you can get. Frankie snatches up his knife, crouches in front of Hub and SWISHES the knife back and forth dramatically.
50) 28) dialog: Sheesh. Oldest trick in the book With a HOWL, Frankie rushes Hub, SLAMS into him, fists flailing: The Fight Is On. The boy flails at Hub, lands an occasional blow, but mostly just expends energy. Hub, however, calmly and collectedly takes the young man apart (CONTINUED)
50) 32) dialog: Then you three better get in there and help him. The other hoods charge in. And, for a minute, it appears Hub is at a disadvantage.... But not for long. Anxious, Walter joins Garth: Garth casually cleans his fingernails with one of the hood's switchblades.
50) 34) dialog: My brother always hogs the bad guys. He's selfish that way.
50) 37) dialog: Naa. After forty years, I'm used to it. Besides... right now, he needs them worse than I do. Hub fights, a grin on his face: he's having the most fun he's had in years.

56) 2) dialog: He's giving them his "What Every Boy Needs to Know About Being a Man" speech. Below, Hub paces back and forth like Patton addressing the troops. The hoods stand up straighter GARTH (Cont'd) A lot of men have heard that speech over the years. A lot of men.
56) 4) dialog: Oh, I guarantee it... Assuming he's still around, of course. Walter nods, troubled at that.
56) 6) dialog: Sure I did: "They got married and lived happily ever after. The End." Remember?
56) 10) dialog: You don't believe all this "Africa" stuff...
56) 12) dialog: Well... After Hub rescued Jasmine, several years passed. Wonderful years.
56) 14) dialog: No two people were ever so happy, so in love. It was perfect.... Except for one thing.
56) 17) dialog: Yes, the Sheik. He hated Hub for stealing Jasmine and for scarring his face. He put a price on Hub's head: ten thousand pieces of gold a fortune. Assassins came from thousands of miles away....
56) 19) dialog: Many dangerous men tried to kill Hub and get the fortune. They turn a corner: THREE ASSASSINS rush them. The lovers dart into a stall: Hub yanks out a tent pole, the awning falls over the assassins, traps them. (CONTINUED)
56) 24) dialog: Hub was furious at the constant danger to Jasmine; he knew the Sheik would never stop. There was only one thing to do. So: one day an assassin led Hub, bound in chains, into the Sheik's fortress to claim the ten thousand pieces of gold.

56) 40) dialog: We were greatly outnumbered. We fought incredible odds.... Garth tries to juggle gold and aim, but Hub is faster and dispatches Garth's target first. Garth scowls as Hub defeats the bad guys before Garth can fire a single shot. GARTH (Cont'd) Then we split up: we each knew what we had to do.... At the doorway, Hub heroically salutes Garth, runs swiftl away. Garth hobbles out with his heavy burden of gold.
56) 42) dialog: High in his opulent bed chamber, the Sheik slept. Until he awoke with Hub's sword at his throat.... Hub stands atop the bed, his blade pins the Sheik GARTH (Cont'd) Terrified, the Sheik knew his life was over, that Hub would certainly kill him. Hub smiled... then lowered his blade. He threw the Sheik a sword, honorably offering his lifelong enemy a fair fight. "Defend yourself!" Hub cried. The evil Sheik grins. The fight begins: CLANG-CLANG! And almost instantly, faster than the eye can follow, Hub sends the Sheik's sword flying and pins the Sheik once again, against a pillar, his blade to the Sheik's throat. GARTH (Cont'd) It was over in a second: Hub had humbled him. The Sheik knew he was surely now a dead man, with no right to even beg for mercy.... As Hub smiles and raises his blade high, the Sheik falls to the floor, WHIMPERING, closing his eyes.... And nothin happens. The Sheik looks up: Hub stands in a window. (CONTINUED)
56) 46) dialog: Personally, I think the Sheik just got too darn busy once they discovered oil in his kingdom and he became one of the five richest men in the world....

56) 59) dialog: One of the ways.... Walter blinks. Below, Hub watches the hoods drive away.
56) 62) dialog: Will you? Hub leans back painfully, exhales.
56) 64) dialog: You've been busy. Terrorizing doctors and nurses, beating up teenagers, chasing after lions. You've had a full day.

56) 75) dialog: Nope...!
