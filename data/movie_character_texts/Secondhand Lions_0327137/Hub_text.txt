8) 3) dialog: Ha! Winged him!
8) 5) dialog: You get ammo! I'll cover him!

8) 10) dialog: Damn it!
9) 1) dialog: We're old, dammit! Leave us alone
9) 4) dialog: Help out? Look at him: the kid's a damn weenie!
11) 2) dialog: Venison! Not steak! Walter frowns, decides to try the sausage: not bad. HUB (Cont'd) Pork!
11) 7) dialog: Know what I hate about houseguests? This! Dinner table chit-chat! Acting so damn nice and polite!
12) 12) dialog: No TV. The brothers sit back reflectively.
13) 4) dialog: Find it yourself! Better yet learn to do without!
13) 6) dialog: ...and fixin' to die any minute! If we kick off in the middle of the night, you're on your own. Eyes huge, Walter stares at them, his imagination whirls:
13) 9) dialog: Jumpy little feller.
14) 4) text: Puzzled, he runs his fingers through sand that covers the trunk bottom. Enchanted, he SNIFFS a handful: it smells exotic. MUSIC ECHOES, evocative, Arabic perhaps. Beneath the sand he sees something, picks it up: it's a faded photo of the most beautiful woman he's ever seen; dark hair, olive skin, piercing eyes. Walter wonders. BANG! A door SLAMS. Walter leaps to the window, looks out: below, Hub strides purposefully out of the house carrying a toilet plunger; he disappears into darkness. Walter runs out of the room, leaps down the stairs.
15) 0) text: Walter bursts out the front door, runs after Hub.
16) 0) text: Walter arrives at the lake, looks around: no one there. It's spooky. A NOISE: startled, Walter turns... Hub looms over him, the toilet plunger raised in attack.
17) 0) text: Morning. Walter, the dogs, and the pig all sleep curled up together. Walter stirs, sits up, looks around: The lakeshore is deserted, Hub is gone. Walter wonders: was it all a dream? A rooster CROWS. Frantic, he runs toward the house.
19) 7) dialog: Brand new mattress. And I'm still waking up tired and sore. Garth smiles knowingly, then sees Walter staring at Hub. Garth wonders, dishes out eggs and sausage. Walter eats, then freezes, he's being watched: in the window, the pig now has an angry rooster perched on its head; now two animals glare murderously at him. SIGH.
19) 12) dialog: ...but that was long ago, and we're old and worthless now! All eat. Silence. Walter tries again.
19) 14) dialog: Stories! Ain't nothing sadder than a couple'a has-beens jabbering about the "good old days". Those days are through, and so are we! All eat in silence. Long pause.
20) 1) dialog: I_ hate this!
20) 3) dialog: Why the hell do we want any damn vegetables, anyway?
20) 5) dialog: To hell with that! He throws down his hoe, storms off.
22) 1) dialog: Hell! We don't want any damn kids! (CONTINUED)
24) 3) dialog: If we're lucky, we won't live that long! Walter slinks in. Hub and Helen stand toe-to-toe.
24) 5) dialog: Whether we take him to the orphanage or tie him up and throw him in the lake, it's our business, not yours! Walter GASPS: all turn, see him standing there, wide-eyed
27) 0) text: A new 1962 Buick pulls up to a stop sign with three unhap men inside, out looking for Walter. Hub GRINDS the gears.
27) 2) dialog: Stop whining! Hub GRINDS the gears again. Ralph glowers.
29) 1) dialog: Lawyer. Stay in the car. Ralph starts to argue, sees Hub's glare, sits back down. Hub nods "go ahead" to Garth, settles back to wait.
29) 5) dialog: What? Me? You go.
30) 0) text: Walter studies his paper. Garth sits on the curb beside Walter, motions for Hub to sit. Hub scowls, but sits. They look at Walter's paper, a page ripped from a phone book: it's the area code map of the United States.
30) 5) dialog: Family...!
30) 16) dialog: Why? Sounds like his mind's made up. Good luck in Montana, kid! Hub stands to go; Garth yanks him back down.
30) 18) dialog: A man needs a good map, that's for sure.... All nod: all agree on the importance of good maps.
30) 20) dialog: Dammit kid! It ain't our fault you got a lousy damn mother! Hub is puzzled why Garth now glares furiously at him. HUB (Cont'd) What?! Walter stands. Consults his map, orients himself. (CONTINUED)
30) 24) dialog: I'll say one thing for this kid: he sure pisses off the relatives. That gives Garth an idea, an inspired idea:
30) 27) dialog: It's so crazy, it just might work!
30) 29) dialog: Make up your mind! We got salesmen back home, waitin' on us!
31) 0) text: The relatives sit beaming at Hub and Garth with phony smiles: they're still here. Hub looks over at Walter:
31) 1) dialog: So, kid! How's that root beer? Walter sips a huge root beer, nods: it's good. Then, he blinks: the relatives now glare murderously at him. Hub and Garth lean back, satisfied: "The Plan" is working. Helen gives Ralph a "go on" sign. He clears his throat: (CONTINUED)
31) 6) dialog: Speak for yourself!
31) 8) dialog: Damn!
31) 13) dialog: I like a challenge.
31) 15) dialog: Come out where we can see you! (CONTINUED)
31) 20) dialog: I'll cover him, you sneak around.... Walter tugs at Hub's shirt; Hub wheels around, SNAPS: HUB (Cont'd)
31) 23) dialog: What the hell for?
31) 28) dialog: We'll see what the man's selling... then we shoot him.
31) 42) dialog: 
31) 47) dialog: Then LEAVE! Garth pulls out a huge money-wad, peels off big bills. Helen fumes, storms off; her furious family follows. As Garth counts out money, the Salesman nearly faints: the once-in-a-lifetime moment every salesman dreams of. The relatives drive away: all glare daggers at Walter.
36) 41) dialog: 
36) 45) dialog: Neither one of you got a lick of sense! Go to bed! Hub storms toward the house, shaking his head. Garth and Walter exchange shrugs, stand, and follow.

39) 0) text: Hub, Garth, and Walter hoe: all three wear new bib-overal and straw hats. The plants are knee-high now, identical. Walter watches Hub, fascinated: Hub attacks the ground as if it was a fight to the death.
39) 1) dialog: We need this much damn garden?
39) 13) dialog: Now wait one damn minute! What's this row? Garth looks. The packet shows a big bushy plant of:
39) 15) dialog: Lettuce! Squash! Sweet potatoes! Carrots! Bok Choi... Bok Choi?
39) 18) dialog: Corn.
39) 21) dialog: Yeah! Like corn!

39) 51) dialog: We want that lion!
39) 58) dialog: Kid, at our age, this is as sporting as we get.
39) 64) text: Walter sweats, pulls, ducks. The crate side falls, SPLAT! Hub and Garth aim, the DRUMS BEAT TO A CRESCENDO... and nothing happens. The DRUMS TRAIL OFF. Pause. Walter peeks between his fingers.
39) 65) dialog: Hey! Come on out of there! Nothing. All look in: a mangy lion looks out at them.
39) 69) dialog: It's alive! That's the main thing!
39) 71) dialog: That wouldn't be sporting, shooting it inside a crate!
39) 73) dialog: Wait 'till it sticks its head out. Then we blast it. Garth shrugs: sounds fair enough. Walter peers in.
39) 81) dialog: Get off me!
39) 84) dialog: So kid. You want to take care of it? Nurse it back to health? (Walter GULPS, nods) Good. Then we shoot it! Hub and Garth head back to the house, arguing:

45) 0) text: Hub tosses the last of the bags into their old farm truck straightens his back. Garth and Walter watch, concerned.
45) 1) dialog: There. If you two old ladies want to get in now, we can go home. Hub hops down off the dock... suddenly his eyes roll up in his head: he collapses and he crumples to the ground.
46) 52) dialog: Where the hell are my pants?! Garth and Walter sit back and EXHALE, relieved. CRASH: DOCTORS and NURSES spill out: Hub storms out, head bandaged, wearing a hospital gown, carrying his clothes trailing an I.V. bottle. He glares at Garth and walter HUB (Cont'd) Who brought me here? You two? Garth and Walter shake their heads innocently.
47) 1) dialog: Hospitals! Lot of good they are!
47) 3) dialog: Did not!
47) 5) dialog: I want to go THIS way! Ahead out the front windshield, Walter sees the familiar gas station/country store now draped with new signs: (CONTINUED)

48) 2) dialog: What the hell does that mean?
48) 4) dialog: Hell no!
48) 6) dialog: Being useless! Pause. Finally Garth nods, he understands. HUB (Cont'd) Me and you, we shoulda died in the last battle of the last war.
48) 8) dialog: It's a damn shame! All around us people died, good people. And we didn't, we're still here. Why? What the hell for? (CONTINUED)
48) 13) dialog: When we were young there was always a reason. A point. Things made sense. There were always things worth dying for. Freedom. Honor Virtue. Now there's no point to anything. What do we do? We garden.... We outlived our time.
49) 0) text: Bearing "Get Well" balloons, relatives peer into Hub's room: they see an empty bed. Helen grabs a DOCTOR.
50) 1) dialog: These days, nothing makes sense. Nothing matters. Through double screen-doors, a convertible SCREECHES UP music BLARING. FOUR HOODS jump out: leather jackets duck tails. They SLAM open both doors, swagger in, stare around insolently as if they own the place. Walter watches the old woman scurry into a door marked "Ladies Room". SLAM. CLICK: she locks the door. Three hoods help themselves to six-packs from a cooler The leader, FRANKIE, sees the uncles, swaggers over.
50) 3) dialog: Get lost, boy. We're busy here.
50) 5) dialog: Here's a perfect example of what I'm talking about. Since this boy was suckling on his momma's teat he's been given everything but discipline. Now his idea of courage and manhood is to get together with a bunch of punk friends and ride around irritating folks too good-natured to put a stop to it. Garth nods sadly. The punks are flabbergasted:
50) 12) dialog: I'm Hub McCann. I've fought in two world wars and countless smaller ones on three continents. I've led thousands of men into battle with everything from horses and swords to artillery and tanks. I've seen the headwaters of the Nile and tribes of natives no white men had ever seen before. I've won and lost a dozen fortunes killed many men, and loved only one woman with a passion a flea like you could never begin to understand. That's who I am. Walter's huge eyes shine. HUB (Cont'd) Now. Go home... boy. With one last patented-Hub-look, Hub tosses Frankie away.
50) 19) dialog: Damn it Garth! Did I ask you to butt in?!
50) 21) dialog: Hell, there's only four of ‘em!
50) 26) dialog: You're holding the knife wrong.
52) 8) dialog: Kid! Go get some meat! Beside Hub, Frankie presses a rag to his bloody nose:
52) 10) dialog: You're in no shape to go home now... GROANS from corpses in the rear. Walter runs up with steaks: Hub and Garth slap the steaks onto black eyes.
52) 22) dialog: The kid. Where'd he go?
52) 24) dialog: 
54) 0) text: Uncles, relatives, and hoods madly tear out of the house, trailing guns and ammunition, sprint toward the cornfield Hub and Garth freeze: in the distance, the lion pins Walt on the ground. Helen SCREAMS. Hub aims.

54) 8) dialog: Attack! All rush in, guns aimed, and freeze: the lion licks Walte who SQUEALS and tries to temper the lion's wet affection.
54) 10) dialog: Jesus! KID! (CONTINUED)
54) 14) dialog: You people tryin' to ruin our whole damn crop? Get out of the cornfield!
55) 5) dialog: That is a consideration. (CONTINUED)
55) 9) dialog: The lion stays. Walter CHEERS, the hoods grin. Helen storms off.
55) 13) dialog: She thinks she's in the jungle.... (all realize he's right) She's a zoo animal. This cornfield's the closest thing to a jungle she's ever seen.... The jungle's in her blood. She knows it's where she belongs. The hoods shake their heads, amazed at all this. Far off, jungle drumbeats ECHO, exotic birds CALL
56) 0) text: Walter and Garth sit, enjoying the evening. Down by the hood's car, Hub intensely lectures to the young men. In the cornfield the lion ROARS happily; COUGH-COUGH-COUGH Garth expertly shuffles a deck of cards, with impressive professional-gambler flourishes, deals a hand of solitair
56) 61) dialog: Those young men will be OK now.
56) 63) dialog: Damn it. I feel... old.
56) 65) dialog: Lucky those boys don't know squat about fighting. It won't be long "til the kid here can whup my ass. The more Hub thinks about it, the more it bothers him. HUB (Cont'd) Won't be long, I'll be helpless in a fight. Useless. (CONTINUED)
56) 69) dialog: I'm going to bed. G'night kid.
56) 71) dialog: "Walter". Doesn't seem... manly enough. How 'bout I call you "walt"?
56) 73) dialog: Goodnight. Walt. He goes inside. Garth can't believe what he's just seen.
58) 0) text: Hub watches DRIVERS unload a broken-down WWI-era biplane. Garth and Walter stare; they're joined by dogs, the pig.. the lion sticks her head out of the cornfield and gapes.
58) 2) dialog: Yup. Always wanted one.
58) 4) dialog: Yup. They're dangerous, all right. Plenty dangerous.... Hub smiles, a disturbingly dark smile. Walter and Garth circle the plane dubiously: half the propeller is missing Even the animals look worried. Hub calls to the DRIVER: HUB (Cont'd) Does this thing come with a... book, instructions...?
58) 6) dialog: h ha!
58) 8) dialog: "To climb, pull back on the stick (MORE ) (CONTINUED)

61) 0) text: Hub stands at the shoreline, looking out over the water Walter appears, followed by dogs and pig. Walter stretche way, way up, and drapes the blanket over Hub's shoulders. Walter paces, deeply troubled. The animals wonder what's going on. Walter has to talk to Hub, he just has to.... (CONTINUED)
61) 3) dialog: What the HELL?!!! (see Walter) It's the middle of the night! What in blazes are you... Hub realizes there's a blanket over his shoulders. HUB (Cont'd) Oh. I wondered where all the blankets were coming from.. (sees Walter's look) What is it? What's the matter? Walter tries to speak, but all courage is gone. His mouth opens and closes, but no sounds emerge. HUB (Cont'd) What...? What is it? Walter struggles, makes some progress: SQUEAKING NOISES.
61) 4) text: HUB (Cont'd) What? You got something to say, spit it out! Walter SWALLOWS HARD, shaking, hyperventilating; he blurt
61) 6) dialog: She died. She died in childbirth. Her and the baby.
61) 13) dialog: I went back to the only life I knew. Back to The Legion.
61) 15) dialog: For the next forty years there was always one more war to fight. Then I got too old and came here.
61) 17) dialog: You should go in now. You'll catch cold.
61) 19) dialog: It doesn't matter....
61) 21) dialog: Dammit, if you want to believe in something, believe in it! Just because something isn't true, that's no reason you can't believe in it! Walter blinks, confused. Hub SIGHS.... (CONTINUED)
61) 25) dialog: Thanks.
61) 27) dialog: When you're ready.
61) 29) dialog: 
61) 32) dialog: Now wait one minute...! Walter goes for broke, speaks in a rush: (CONTINUED)

61) 40) dialog: I'll write it down!
61) 42) dialog: You won't be living here then...
61) 44) dialog: Now you're just being silly.
61) 48) dialog: All right, dammit! You win! I'll stick around and be your damn uncle! But don't expect me to be happy about it! Hub thrusts out his hand to shake on it. Walter SNIFFLES, grabs Hub in a big hug, mid-thigh. Hub looks startled... then, he reaches down and gently pats Walter's head.
68) 0) text: Lights CLICK on: Hub and Garth run out, carrying shotguns
69) 0) text: Hub, Garth, and Mae run toward the frightful HOWLS: GGGGRRROOO... The cry CHOKES and cuts off, mid-roar there's one last death-rattle WHEEZE... then SILENCE.

70) 9) dialog: A lot of stitches. But Walter only cares about Jasmine: he cradles the limp head of the valiant lion in his lap.

71) 0) text: Inside the cornfield, wearing Sunday best: Walter, Hub, Garth, and the animals surround a grave-mound: they've buried the lion where she belonged, in the cornfield. Walter SNIFFLES as he POUNDS in a wooden cross, says a silent prayer, and looks up at his uncles. Pause.

73) 3) dialog: Stan, you were lucky... lucky that lion got you before we did! Stan's eyes grow very wide. HUB (Cont'd) Know they do to men who hurt kids back in North Africa, Stan? (Stan shakes his head) Well! First they take a rope....
75) 1) dialog: ...and then, after every bone in the body is broken, they take a razor sharp sword and two hundred pounds of salt.... Just getting warmed-up, Hub sees Walter and Mae approach. HUB (Cont'd) Oh well. To make a long story short, Stan: you and me can be friends.... or we can be enemies. Hub gives him that look: the helpless Stan quakes.

83) 0) text: Hub, Garth, and the animals listlessly sit on the porch in their "waiting for salesmen" places. Long pause.
