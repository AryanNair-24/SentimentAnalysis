2) 5) dialog: In the summer of 1922, the tempo of the city approached hysteria...
2) 12) dialog: The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired... making the liquor cheaper.

2) 18) dialog: And I was one of them.
3) 3) dialog: I rented a house twenty miles from the city, on Long Island.
3) 6) dialog: I lived at West Egg...
4) 3) dialog: ...in a forgotten grounds-keeper's cottage squeezed among the mansions of the newly rich.
5) 3) dialog: To get started, I bought a dozen volumes on credit, banking and
5) 7) dialog: All new to me...
6) 8) dialog: Yes sir, of course nothing is one hundred percent. Well, I wouldn't go investing every penny. But...
7) 3) dialog: At Yale, I'd dreamed of being a writer.
7) 6) dialog: But I gave all that up.
8) 3) dialog: With the sun shining and the great bursts of leaves on the trees, I planned to spend the summer studying.

8) 13) dialog: Owned by a gentleman I had not yet met, named...
10) 3) dialog: She lived across the bay...
11) 3) dialog: In old money East Egg.

11) 22) dialog: But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs.
13) 12) dialog: Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see...
13) 48) dialog: She was the most frightening person I'd ever seen--
13) 54) dialog: But I enjoyed looking at her.

17) 6) dialog: And something told me it was... Mr. Gatsby.
17) 9) dialog: He seemed to be... reaching toward something out there in the dark.
18) 42) dialog: The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place...
19) 3) dialog: New York's dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city...
19) 6) dialog: ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
19) 10) dialog: ...This fantastic farm was ever- watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg...
19) 13) dialog: ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes brooded over it all like the eyes of God.
20) 3) dialog: Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club....
20) 6) dialog: But the day took an unexpected turn...
21) 3) dialog: What are we doing?
23) 101) dialog: I had been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon...
23) 105) dialog: That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all... And suddenly, I began to like New York.
23) 119) dialog: High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street...
24) 3) dialog: ...and I was him too, looking up and wondering...
25) 3) dialog: I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life...
28) 5) dialog: But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling...
28) 9) dialog: ....that Gatsby was watching me.
30) 3) dialog: You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited...
30) 6) dialog: The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby's...
31) 3) dialog: And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby's door...
33) 4) dialog: A caravansary of...
33) 7) dialog: Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby's beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors...
33) 11) dialog: Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven!
33) 22) dialog: Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk.
37) 57) dialog: His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in.
40) 3) dialog: We rode in the hydroplane... And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until...
42) 30) dialog: The way he spoke... No wonder people thought he was lying...
42) 50) dialog: Just when I thought it couldn't be any more fantastical...
42) 54) dialog: He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army!
42) 83) dialog: What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true?
42) 128) dialog: I didn't know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all...
42) 132) dialog: Even Gatsby could happen...
51) 3) dialog: What was in the letter?
54) 14) dialog: I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew?
55) 3) dialog: When I returned home, Gatsby's was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn't a sound.
67) 3) dialog: Looking over my story so far, I'm reminded that for the second time that summer...
67) 6) dialog: I was guarding other people's secrets.
68) 3) dialog: Once again I was within...
68) 6) dialog: And without...
75) 41) dialog: Five lost years struggled on Daisy's lips. But all she could manage was...
75) 52) dialog: Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.
77) 14) dialog: If only it had been enough for Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy...
78) 3) dialog: But he had a grand vision for his life, and Daisy's part in it.
79) 3) dialog: It wasn't until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy...
80) 13) dialog: His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota...
80) 16) dialog: But he never accepted them as his parents at all.
80) 19) dialog: In his own imagination, he was... a Son of God...
80) 22) dialog: Destined for future glory...
81) 3) dialog: Chasing this destiny, a sixteen year old Gatz ran far, far away.
82) 3) dialog: One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril...
82) 19) dialog: This was his opportunity, and he seized it.
83) 5) dialog: He sailed the yacht out of danger - and into his future...
84) 3) dialog: Gatsby showed skill and ambition, and for five years they sailed the world...
85) 3) dialog: How to dress, act, and speak like a gentleman...
86) 8) dialog: Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody's fortune... But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated out of his inheritance by Cody's family... He'd been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor.
86) 17) dialog: By midsummer Gatsby was front page news...
87) 3) dialog: Where did the money comes from?
87) 6) dialog: That's what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom's mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby's glittering parties...
99) 3) dialog: Gatsby disappeared to deal with a dispute of some sort. Daisy waited...
102) 47) dialog: He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something...
102) 51) dialog: Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy...
102) 61) dialog: Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy's house by colossal accident.
102) 68) dialog: But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself.
107) 8) dialog: He knew that if he kissed this girl his mind would never again be free to romp like... the mind of God... That falling in love would change his destiny... forever.
109) 4) dialog: She blossomed for him like a flower...
109) 7) dialog: And the incarnation was complete.
112) 3) dialog: There were no more parties...
112) 6) dialog: Gatsby's lights went out one by one.
112) 9) dialog: Daisy visited discreetly. But...
112) 14) dialog: The very same fame that had once been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby, became... a threat.
115) 7) dialog: Is everything alright?
116) 5) dialog: I hear you fired all your servants?
121) 59) dialog: She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen...
124) 14) dialog: Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control...
125) 52) dialog: I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back.
125) 217) dialog: Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had "killed a man."
125) 235) dialog: He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on...
125) 264) dialog: Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness...
125) 267) dialog: The formidable stroke of thirty died away, as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight, towards death...
137) 10) dialog: I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was...
137) 40) dialog: That was the night he finally told me the truth. All of it.
138) 10) dialog: He revealed his humble beginnings, his transformative voyage with Dan Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he'd joined Wolfsheim in the business...
139) 3) dialog: It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby's... extraordinary gift for hope.
139) 7) dialog: A gift that I have never found in any other person...
139) 11) dialog: And which it is not likely I shall ever find again.
139) 29) dialog: It had all been for her. The house the parties, everything.
141) 39) dialog: I was always glad I said that... It was the only compliment I ever paid him.
142) 3) dialog: That morning, Wall Street boomed, its usual golden roar... But I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work. I waited for Gatsby to call with news...
143) 3) dialog: While he waited for Daisy...
149) 3) dialog: After all these years, I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day as an endless drill...
149) 6) dialog: ...of police and photographers and tabloid reporters.
149) 10) dialog: The headlines were a nightmare... They pinned everything on Gatsby.
149) 16) dialog: The affair with Myrtle...
149) 20) dialog: The hit and run...
149) 24) dialog: Everything.
150) 3) dialog: And there was nothing I could say except the one unutterable fact that none of it was true...
153) 5) dialog: Gone away...? Do you know when they'll be back.
155) 3) dialog: Hello...? Hello!?
156) 3) dialog: They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and people and then retreated back into their money and their vast carelessness...
157) 3) dialog: I rang, I wrote, I implored...
157) 9) dialog: But not a single one of the sparkling hundreds who had enjoyed his hospitality all summer, attended the funeral...
157) 12) dialog: And from Daisy, not even a flower.
157) 15) dialog: I was all he had; the only one who cared...
159) 4) dialog: After Gatsby's death, New York was haunted for me...
159) 7) dialog: That city... My once golden... shimmering mirage, now made me sick.
160) 3) dialog: On my last night in New York... I returned to that huge, incoherent house once more.
161) 3) dialog: Wolfsheim's 'associates' had cleaned the place out...
162) 3) dialog: I remembered how we had all come to Gatsby's, and guessed at his corruption... While he had stood before us concealing an incorruptible dream...
163) 3) dialog: The moon rose higher... And as I stood there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.
163) 6) dialog: He had come such a long way...
163) 9) dialog: And his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.
163) 14) dialog: He did not know that it was already behind him...
163) 17) dialog: Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us...
163) 20) dialog: It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster...
163) 23) dialog: Stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning...
163) 27) dialog: So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly, into the past.
