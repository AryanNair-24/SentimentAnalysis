The Winchester flips full circl into the air as the bunk behind it is shredded from above With an odd kind of inevitability, as though seeking its  rightful place, the Winchester arcs into a shaft of light where it is met by Emmett's steady, waiting hands. Before has even settled, he has cocked and fired twice through a hole in the roof. Emmett stops and lowers the carbine. Th Man on the Roof falls spread-eagled through the weakened  ceiling.
