23) 15) text: The Second Man lurches up to the bar and pins Mal's arms  behind him. The First Man moves quickly, cocking back his arm for a punch square in Mal's face. As the blow is  unleashed, Mal bends forward with terrific speed and forc pulling the Second Man onto his back. The Second Man's fa is suddenly where Mal's was an instant ago, and the First Man's punch lands hard on it. Mal slams the Second Man's  back against the edge of the bar; he falls to the floor. blocks a blow from the First Man and steps in with a flur of body blows. Back at the Tough Men's table, the Third Man pushes back chair as if to rise. Emmett has just picked up a chicken  leg; now he waves it ever so slightly at the Third Man: " out of it". The Man looks at Emmett and Paden, then settl back into his seat. Mal sends the First Man crashing down through a table wit final blow. He turns in time to see the Second Man, back his feet, grab Mal's whiskey bottle and break it against bar. Mal looks for a frustrated moment at the splashing  whiskey -- what a waste. The Second Man lunges with the s glass. Mal lifts the heavy statuette easily with one hand and uses its upraised arms to catch the Man's wrist and t the bottle painfully from his grasp. Mal's other hand hit the Man once in the throat, and he is down. The Proprietor rises from behind the bar, a sawed-off sho in his hand. Mal spins, swinging the statuette brutally  against the Proprietor's arm. The shotgun clatters to the floor as the Proprietor recoils in pain, crashing into a  shelf of glasses. The fight is over. Suddenly, standing in the doorway holding a leveled gun i an enormously tall figure -- SHERIFF LANGSTON. Dressed ra elegantly in suit and bowler, he dwarfs the man at his si DEPUTY KERN. He surveys the scene as the three injured me stir back to life. When he speaks, it is, surprisingly, w a British accent --

His hat lands on the saloon floor, spins on on its brim, and settles into stillness like a tossed coi Silence in the saloon. Then, in a far corner, the BANGING chairs and a door SLAMMING. Paden's gun points that way, there is no one there. Only an overturned chair, and an e pair of boots -- Paden's. Paden picks up his hat and walks toward his boots. Emmett moves to the dead man, unbuckles the gunbelt, and pulls i free of the body. He picks up the bone-handled Colt and p it in the holster, then stops abruptly. We hear the stead advance of FOOTSTEPS across the saloon floor. Emmett's ey follow the off-screen presence. Paden, seated, is pulling on his newly-regained boots wit delighted air when a shadow surges up and engulfs him. He looks up. Sheriff Langston towers over him.

71) 37) dialog: Stella, this is one of my oldest  surviving friends. Treat him right.
71) 39) dialog: (laughs) Oh, yeah, you two are going to get  along fine. You got a lot in common.
71) 41) dialog: Kelly, get over here. (to Paden) You didn't come all this way just to  pay me back that money, did you? (turns to Kelly) Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
71) 43) dialog: Give the man a line of credit. He  already owes the house thirteen bucks.
71) 45) dialog: You got a place to stay?
71) 47) dialog: Stella, we still got an extra room  out back, don't we?
71) 50) dialog: What brings you into my saloon?

71) 57) dialog: Welcome to heaven.
77) 8) dialog: (interested) Pleasure is mine. Always happy to  meet a friend of Paden's. (yelling to Stella) Stella, bring Kelly out here, will  you?
77) 10) dialog: You're Kate Hollis' brother, aren't  you? (Emmett nods) You're the one who killed old Murdo  McKendrick.
77) 13) dialog: Can't be having that now can we?
77) 16) dialog: We're going to make some adjustments.  I wanted you to be here when I offered  Paden your job. I think he could do  it without getting greedy. Stella  and I are tired of you skimming our  profits.
77) 19) dialog: I'm done talking. Get out.
77) 21) dialog: (smiling) Really?
77) 23) dialog: How about it, Paden? You want the  job?

77) 36) dialog: Didn't have much choice.
78) 1) dialog: I never enjoy killing a man.
78) 5) dialog: That's him.
78) 7) dialog: I gotta get somebody to clean up  this mess.
81) 0) text: The room is crowded but silent, frozen. Near the middle o the bar the sexy, young, saloon girl, PHOEBE, stands  frightened between Jake and Tyree, the mean fellow we saw released at Chimayo -- now a deputy for Sheriff Cobb. The two men appear about to draw.
86) 1) dialog: He must be pretty good.
86) 3) dialog: What about his brother?
86) 6) dialog: Things are getting messy around here. (he looks at McKendrick) I hear Ezra Johnson got himself  killed.
86) 8) dialog: Did you hear his son is still around?
87) 1) dialog: This'll be for Paden.
87) 3) dialog: It's an advance. We want him to know  he's going to be happy here.
87) 5) dialog: I thought you two would get along.
88) 2) dialog: He says he doesn't care about  anything, but he does. There's just  no telling what it's going to be.
88) 4) dialog: Howdy, Mr. Slick.
88) 7) dialog: Let me tell you about your friend  Paden. Me and him and Tyree and a  few other boys did a good bit of  riding together a few years back.  Business, you know, and business was  pretty good. We were moving around a  lot, the way you have to in that  work, and somewhere along the line  we picked up this dog. One of the  boys took to feeding it, so it  followed us everywhere. Anyway, this  one time we were leaving a little  Missouri town in quite a hurry, with  a bunch of the locals on our tails.  The dog somehow got tangled up with  Tyree's horse and Tyree went flying.  Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped  up, so he shot the dog. Didn't kill  him, though. Before you know it,  Paden's off his horse and holding  the dog. He'd gone all strange on  us. Said we should go on without  him. I thought he was kidding at  first. But he wasn't. Tyree was ready  to plug 'em both. And all this with  the posse coming down on us. Here I  thought we were pals after all that  riding. And suddenly he's more worried  about a mutt. So we did like he asked  and left him. He went to jail for a  dog.
88) 9) dialog: And you want to hear the funny part?  Paden didn't even like the damn dog.
88) 16) dialog: C'mon, Paden, I'll buy you a drink.
88) 18) dialog: I took out thirteen dollars.
88) 20) dialog: I told you this was a sweet set-up.
88) 22) dialog: Maybe you could run it without Stella.
88) 26) dialog: Easy, boy. Just an idea.
88) 28) dialog: You know, Paden, what makes all this  work is me doing my job. The fellows  you came to town with are causing  some trouble. It's going to take a  little straightening out. I have my  responsibilities. I want you to  understand. It has nothing to do  with us.
88) 31) dialog: Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between  us.
88) 33) dialog: So we understand each other?
101) 1) dialog: You must be Ezra Johnson's boy.
101) 3) dialog: Don't shoot the sheriff. It's against  the law.
101) 5) dialog: So's killing a deputy.
101) 7) dialog: We're going to give you a fair  trial...
101) 9) dialog: ...followed by a first-class hanging.
101) 11) dialog: Or you can ride out of here before  dawn.
101) 13) dialog: All you gotta do is tell me where to  find your friend Emmett.
118) 3) dialog: Give it up.
118) 5) dialog: I hate to see this kind of thing in  my town.
118) 7) dialog: I'm going to have to look into this.
118) 9) dialog: (looks at him) I thought we talked about that.
118) 12) dialog: You're still worried about the dog,  aren't you?
118) 14) dialog: You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything  will be put straight in a few days.
118) 17) dialog: I never could count on you to be  reasonable. (turns back to Paden) Don't force me to make an adjustment  around here.
118) 19) dialog: I'm not thinking about your future,  Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
118) 21) dialog: Not a thing. She's just a mutual  friend. (a beat) But if you wind up on the wrong side  of this, she's going to get hurt.
118) 23) dialog: I'm just trying to save you from  yourself. Don't change your luck.
118) 25) dialog: Get some sleep, Paden. Things'll  look better tomorrow.
133) 1) dialog: Get Kyle and Dusty over here. And  keep your eyes open. I'm running out  of deputies.
134) 3) dialog: And you don't know where Paden is?
134) 5) dialog: Let me know if you do. And tell Stella  I want to see her.
160) 3) dialog: This is as far as it's going.
160) 9) dialog: This used to be a peaceful town.
160) 12) dialog: Hide and watch.
183) 1) dialog: What a waste. This could have been  such a sweet deal for us.
183) 3) dialog: Good-bye, Paden.
