34) 5) dialog: Are you alright?
34) 7) dialog: Hello?
34) 9) dialog: That’s not the point Ed- A CRACKING SOUND. They turn to see the broken body liftin its head, revealing...a GRIZZLED ZOMBIE. It hisses.
34) 10) dialog: Oh thank God for that. The irony of this hits SHAUN as ED hits the gas.
35) 0) text: SHAUN and ED pull up outside Barbara and Philip’s. The on other car in the street is a gleaming JAGUAR XJ6 sitting the driveway. ED whistles.

35) 4) dialog: I left half a Mars Bar in the glove box once, he chased me round the garden with a piece of wood.
35) 6) dialog: Come on, it seems clear enough.
35) 8) dialog: What? Why?
35) 10) dialog: Okay. Uncertain, SHAUN runs up the path. ED calls after him.
35) 13) dialog: Hey Mum.
35) 15) dialog: You alright?
35) 17) dialog: Where’s Philip? 59.
35) 19) dialog: He’s not my Dad.

35) 56) dialog: How much do you love Philip?
35) 58) dialog: I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982. 62.
35) 60) dialog: Mum, how much do you love Philip?
35) 62) dialog: I’m sorry but...what would you think if I told you that he has, over the years, been quite unkind to me.
35) 64) dialog: Mum, he chased me with a piece of wood.
35) 66) dialog: Did he tell you that?
35) 68) dialog: Motherfucker.
35) 70) dialog: Sorry Mother...Mum. Did you know that, on several occasions, he touched me? BARBARA flashes SHAUN a look.
35) 71) dialog: Sorry, that’s not true. Look, Mum you don’t understand- BARBARA stops what she’s doing. Turns to SHAUN. 63.
35) 78) dialog: It wasn’t as easy as all that. ED tuts at SHAUN. PHILIP stands by the JAG.
35) 80) dialog: I think it’s best if we go in the- (looks to ED) Where’s the car? ED looks sheepishly off. We follow his gaze to see the RENAULT MEGANE wrapped around a lamppost. A write-off.
35) 82) dialog: You were parked.
35) 84) dialog: Umm. ..Philip?
35) 86) dialog: Look out! Too late. The ZOMBIE grabs PHILIP and takes a huge bite o of his shoulder.
35) 89) dialog: Philip, give me the car keys!
35) 91) dialog: Phillip... SHAUN spins and deftly smashes the 2nd ZOMBIE in the face knocking the whistle down his throat. 65.
35) 92) dialog: ...give me the car keys! PHILIP gives them to SHAUN, who throws them to ED.
35) 93) dialog: Ed! Get Mum in the car.
35) 96) dialog: Maybe I should drive.
35) 98) dialog: Go on then. Just be caref- He’s drowned out by ED’s HARD HOUSE tape. They scream off
36) 0) text: London whizzes by. We catch whispers of ACCIDENTS, a CAR driving erratically with a BABY CARRIAGE on the roof. We ZOMBIES beating down the doors of houses. A huddle of ZOM KIDS are gathered around a body next to an ABANDONED ICE CREAM VAN. SHAUN attempts to bandage the profusely bleeding PHILIP w his jacket. The HARD HOUSE blares from the stereo.
37) 2) dialog: Mum, this won’t take a second. SHAUN tries the door, it won’t open. He turns to PHILIP.
37) 3) dialog: Have you still got the child locks on?
37) 5) dialog: Ed, stay moving. Any problems-
38) 0) text: A worried DAVID and DIANNE huddle round the entry phone, which buzzes with sounds of PITCH BATTLE. LIZ emerges fro her room and joins them. There is a noise at the window- It’s SHAUN. At the glass.
38) 1) dialog: Guys? Let me in, please.
38) 3) dialog: I've come to get you.
38) 5) dialog: It’s okay, it’s not mine. LIZ opens the window. SHAUN tumbles in, bat in hand. LIZ looks at him, half way between angry and impressed.
38) 7) dialog: I’ve come to take you somewhere safe.
38) 9) dialog: You don’t know that. 68.
38) 13) dialog: Believe me, it only takes one of them to know you’re in here. Liz, I tried calling but I couldn’t get through. I had to come up with a plan.
38) 15) dialog: I don’t care what the telly says, we have to get out of here. If we stay, they will break down the door, they will come up here and they will tear us to pieces and that’s really going to exacerbate matters for all of us.
38) 17) dialog: Listen to me. Please. You have to trust me. I’ve been out there, I’ve seen what’s happening. They’re not just going to give up and go away. They’11 keep coming.
38) 19) dialog: This isn’t about you and me Liz. It’s about survival. We need to be somewhere more secure, somewhere on the ground. Somewhere we can survive. LIZ'’s reluctance seems to waver.
38) 21) dialog: What? What?
38) 31) dialog: Liz? All eyes are on an uncertain LIZ. From outside, we hear a building chorus of moans. LIZ takes a deep breath.
38) 33) dialog: Right...uh, I’ve got a car outside, but it’s going to be a bit cramped. So, have either of you got transport?
38) 35) dialog: Good. Where?
38) 37) dialog: David?
38) 39) dialog: Okay then, let’s just gather any blunt objects. If you get cornered, bash them in the head, that seems to work. Just keep together, stay sharp and follow me.
38) 41) dialog: (firmly) We’re going to The Winchester. CLOSE on the incredulous faces of LIZ, DI and DAVID. EXT. LIZ’S FLAT -MOMENTS LATER CLOSE on the terrified faces of LIZ, DI and DAVID; as the clumsily battle the ZOMBIES on their doorstep. LIZ wields hockey stick, DAVID an umbrella, DIANNE a piece of driftw SHAUN guides them through the crowd with his cricket bat.

38) 49) dialog: I know, I know. Be careful will you Ed?
38) 51) dialog: He’s not my Dad.
38) 53) dialog: I know. Ed, will you please be careful?!
38) 56) dialog: I want to get there in one piece. And why are we going this way?
38) 58) dialog: But the other road goes straight to The Winchester.
38) 61) dialog: It’s a pub, it’s safe, it’s secure-
38) 64) dialog: (floundering) It’s got heavy doors. It’s got dead bolts. You’ve been to a lock in.
38) 70) dialog: Big Al also says dogs can’t look up.
38) 74) dialog: Of course they can-
38) 76) dialog: Look, the pub’s the right place to go. Everything’s gonna be fine. Promise. Hearing the ‘P’ word, LIZ, DAVID and DI frown at SHAUN.
38) 78) dialog: I turned it off, alright?
38) 80) dialog: What? PHILIP is fading, he tugs on SHAUN’s arm and whispers.
38) 82) dialog: What? 74.
38) 84) dialog: Yeah...well, I wasn’t the easiest person to live with.
38) 86) dialog: Philip, you don’t have to explain...
38) 89) dialog: (tremulously) Ed, could you pull over?
38) 92) dialog: Ed! Will you just pull over, please.
38) 94) dialog: 
38) 97) dialog: Christ! What the hell are you doing?
38) 99) dialog: Stop-telling-me-to-chill-out! ED huffs in sulky protest. SHAUN gathers himself.
38) 100) dialog: And no, everyone is not alright.
38) 102) dialog: Uh, well...Mum?
38) 104) dialog: Mum, it’s Philip...he’s gone.
38) 106) dialog: Mum, he’s dead.
38) 111) dialog: Ed, the child locks! ED slopes towards the door, but LIZ quickly steps in befo him to open it. DAVID and DI fall out, followed by SHAUN. turns to see PHILIP lunge at him. SHAUN slams the car doo
38) 112) dialog: Safety first Philip. SHAUN swings round and glowers at ED. He glowers right ba
38) 114) dialog: We have to keep moving.
38) 116) dialog: We haven’t got time.
38) 120) dialog: He’s not my Dad!
38) 122) dialog: He’s not Mum. He was but he’s not anymore-
38) 124) dialog: That’s not even your husband. I know it looks like him but believe me, there is nothing of the man you loved in that car now. Nothing. BEHIND we see ZOMBIE PHILIP reach forward and SWITCH THE HOUSE OFF. He sits back and looks almost peaceful.
38) 125) dialog: Let’s go shall we?
39) 0) text: SHAUN walks briskly along a high-fenced back alley.
39) 1) dialog: Everyone okay back there?
39) 8) dialog: Totally, totally.

39) 14) dialog: D’you think it’s happening there?
39) 16) dialog: Look Liz...about last night. I know a lot of things were said, but I just wanted you to know that-

39) 27) dialog: Yvonne? YVONNE is heading in the opposite direction with an uncan similar bunch of FRIENDS and FAMILY.
39) 29) dialog: Uh...surviving.
39) 38) dialog: Yeah, we're heading to the Winchester.
39) 40) dialog: Yeah.
39) 42) dialog: You too. YVONNE and SHAUN hug. This time it’s real and affectionat The two groups move their separate ways. There is a weird poignancy to this passing...before YVONNE calls out.
40) 1) dialog: What’d I tell you? Pub’s just over there. We see the WINCHESTER’s sign in the distance.
40) 3) dialog: What’s the matter David, never taken a short cut? SHAUN attempts to vault the fence in a super cool fashion However it breaks under his weight, an entire section of fence FALLING FLAT. SHAUN quickly gets up and beckons the others to follow. BARBARA dawdles behind in a dazed fashi
42) 1) dialog: Right...Everyone just stay where they...hang on, are we all here? DI does a quick head count.
42) 3) dialog: There’s six of us. A YELP from next door.
42) 4) dialog: Mum! SHAUN jumps onto a TRAMPETTE and vaults the fence with lightning speed...
43) 1) dialog: Mum, are you okay?
44) 5) dialog: Feel free to step in anytime!
44) 8) dialog: Right-
44) 10) dialog: -Everyone just stay where they are. I’ll check if the coast is clear. SHAUN climbs up...then climbs down.
44) 12) dialog: No.
44) 14) dialog: Lots. We CRANE UP over the fence to reveal a HUNDRED WALKING DE between them and the pub. The GANG peer through the gaps.
44) 39) dialog: This is the night. ED makes a sarcastic ZOMBIE noise. SHAUN tuts.
44) 41) dialog: What? 86.
45) 2) dialog: Get round me. The GANG surround SHAUN. He kneels at the letter box.
45) 3) dialog: John, Bernie, are you there? (louder ) John! John! Bernie! Some of the nearby ZOMBIES are faintly suspicious. SHAUN (CONT’D) DAVID It’s Shaun and Ed.

45) 13) dialog: There's a-
45) 16) dialog: What am I doing? What are you doing you stupid moron? 87. over to A HALLOWEEN RING TONE. SHAUN glares furiously at ED, almo daring him to answer it. He does, holding up a hand. SHAUN SMACKS THE MOBILE FROM ED’S HAND. It skitters away. 88.
45) 18) dialog: No, you fuck off. Fuck-fucking-off! SHAUN smacks ED hard with each successive ‘fuck’.
45) 20) dialog: I’ve spent a lifetime sticking my neck out for you, you idiot and all you ever do is fuck things up. Fuck things up and make me look stupid. Well, I’m not going to let you do it. Not today. ED is for once, speechless. LIZ taps SHAUN on the shoulde

45) 29) dialog: They’11 follow us. Keep up the act. I’m going to have to do something. 89.
45) 31) dialog: Oiiiiiiiiiiiiii! EVERY SINGLE ZOMBIE turns their attention to SHAUN.
45) 32) dialog: Wait ‘til I’ve gone, then get inside.
45) 34) dialog: (looks directly at Ed) I won't be gone long. (to LIZ) Promise. SHAUN looks at ED who looks back, concerned. A moment of silent understanding. SHAUN jumps down right into the thi of the approaching hordes and sprints off, yelling and wa his arms, drawing all the ZOMBIES away. He disappears out sight. The GANG are all shocked by this, particularly ED.
46) 46) dialog: Hello Mum. SHAUN IS BACK. Striding in from behind the bar. There’s s and delight from all but DAVID. SHAUN strolls over to LIZ
46) 47) dialog: Everything okay? SHAUN pops a Pork Scratching into his mouth.
46) 48) dialog: Any sign of John and Bernie?
46) 51) dialog: Did you check upstairs? SHAUN goes to the back corridor and tries a door marked ‘PRIVATE’. He forces it a little. It won’t open.
46) 53) dialog: What’s the phone situation?
46) 56) dialog: Promised didn’t I? DAVID steps in.
46) 58) dialog: I just gave them the slip. It wasn’t too difficult. They’re not all that. SHAUN casually leans back against the bar.
46) 60) dialog: Do I look like I’ve been bitten? DAVID eyes SHAUN’s bloodstained shirt, suspiciously.
46) 62) dialog: (indicating stains) Look, this is all from earlier and this is from Philip.
46) 64) dialog: Pen.
46) 66) dialog: There is a back door. Through the yard. I tried to tell you before you went and smashed the window.

46) 72) dialog: Thanks babe. SHAUN takes a long swig. Everyone looks at him expectantl
47) 1) dialog: Anybody want a peanut? The GANG sit in the dark, in their OPENING SCENE position their usual table, BARBARA is huddled nearby. Empty glass and mountain of empty snack packets on the table. Chairs tables are stacked against the doors and windows. The gen mood has soured. DAVID looks at SHAUN smugly.
47) 2) dialog: How about another drink? 96. Nobody does. SHAUN looks to the pool table.
47) 3) dialog: How about pool? Again, no response.
47) 4) dialog: Probably a bit noisy...with the...uh ball release... SHAUN fiddles with his beermat.
47) 5) dialog: Ed, why don’t you do your ‘Clyde’?

54) 34) dialog: -twenty nine bullets-
54) 36) dialog: -twenty nine shells, so we should work together on this. I need someone to help me reload and everyone else to keep look out. I’ll fire. As Bertrand Russell once said, “the only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation”. I think we can all appreciate the relevance of that now.

54) 222) dialog: But- LIZ bundles SHAUN behind the bar. They crouch down, kicki the back door shut and holding it with their feet.
54) 223) dialog: Ed! No answer.

55) 0) text: They pull ED down into a dark cellar, filled with boxes a laundry. SHAUN grabs some piping from the floor and shove through the handle of the trapdoor, wedging it shut. ED slumps against the wall, the beer cloth already sodden with blood. LIZ grabs some linen from the washing line an uses it to bandage ED’s wounds. In the far corner of the cellar, a shaft of orange street light illuminates the outline of the BARREL HATCH.

55) 3) dialog: 
55) 6) dialog: WHY WON’T IT OPEN? 123. SHAUN drops down again and slides down the wall, utterly defeated. He laughs grimly.
55) 7) dialog: So that’s that then. We’re trapped. ‘Let’s go to the Winchester’. Who the fuck came up with that idea? (puts head in hands) Oh man, I’ve really ballsed this up. LIZ leaves ED and sits with SHAUN on the floor. The noise from upstairs is muffled, the cellar oddly quiet.
55) 9) dialog: I have Liz. I’m useless. I couldn’t save us. I couldn’t save Di and David. I couldn’t even save my own mother. I should have been there. I can’t-

55) 20) dialog: There’s only two shells. What about Ed?
55) 22) dialog: How are we gonna do this?
55) 24) dialog: Maybe one of us has to ‘do’ the other and then ‘do’ themselves.
55) 26) dialog: I really don’t know if I’ve got it in me to shoot my mum, my flat-mate and my girlfriend all in the same evening.
55) 28) dialog: Well, you don’t want to die single do you? They laugh and look deeply into each other’s eyes. 125.
55) 30) dialog: Besides, I’ve changed y’know? I haven’t had a fag since yesterday. I promise.
55) 34) dialog: They were in the bin!
55) 36) dialog: Sneaky cow. They each take a cigarette. LIZ shrugs.
55) 38) dialog: Aah, I won't say anything. SHAUN ignites his lighter. The flame illuminates A RED BU on the wall, above which is a sign reading... ‘WAY OUT’ SHAUN holds the lighter up to reveal an electric door mechanism. They were sitting on the SERVICE LIFT all alon He and LIZ exchange a look. They nod. A silent agreement. CRACK. The CELLAR DOOR splinters. DEAD FINGERS claw throu as the smoke thickens. They are almost inside. SHAUN runs to ED’s side. He is pale and visibly fading.
55) 39) dialog: Come on. We’re leaving. 126.
55) 41) dialog: But we can all get out.
55) 43) dialog: What are you talking about?
55) 45) dialog: Nah. You have it. I can’t hit anything with it anyway. ED takes the RIFLE from SHAUN.
55) 46) dialog: I’m sorry Ed.
55) 48) dialog: I’m sorry I shouted at you earlier.
55) 50) dialog: It’s okay.

57) 0) text: Bare feet lumber into shot. Slowly we PAN UP. SHAUN. His is tired, but happy. He yawns. We are back in the lounge. The room is tidy, but the deco little different. More homely. There are photos of Shaun Liz on the wall, next to two mounted rifles and posters advertising a club at which Shaun now Deejays. 130. We also see pictures of David and Di and Barbara and Phil arranged like little shrines. LIZ sits on the sofa, idly flicking through the cable channels. She is wearing BARBARA’S RING. SHAUN kisses her
