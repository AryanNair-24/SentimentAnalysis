0) 16) dialog: We have a laugh don’t we?
0) 18) dialog: But with Ed always here, it’s no wonder I end up bringing my flatmates out. Then that only exacerbates things.

16) 7) dialog: Cuh! DIANNE is relieved. DAVID remains affronted. LIZ storms i the lounge, with SHAUN in tow, helping her with her coat.
16) 9) dialog: Oh stop making these promises!

16) 27) dialog: “To A Wonderful Mum”?
16) 29) dialog: They are for your Mum aren’t they?
16) 31) dialog: Smooth. LIZ returns her head to her hands.
16) 33) dialog: You're tired? It’s not the strongest defence is it? I’m tired Shaun.
16) 35) dialog: The ‘S’ word again.
16) 37) dialog: You can’t just keep saying ‘sorry’ and expect things to be okay. You wave it around like a ‘get out of jail free’ card.
16) 39) dialog: What if you are? It’s not like you ever do anything about it. Nothing ever changes. (she sighs) Look, I’ve got to do something. If I don’t, I’m going to end up in that pub, every night for the rest of my life, like those other sad old fuckers, drinking myself to death, wondering what the hell happened.
32) 41) text: SHAUN, ED and BARBARA are greeted by a grateful LIZ on the doorstep. They sit inside, drinking tea and eating biscuits. Why do we have to go to Liz’s?

38) 6) dialog: Sorry, what are you doing? SHAUN stands and catches his breath.
38) 14) dialog: Oh, you made a plan?
38) 16) dialog: Smooth.
38) 18) dialog: Shaun-
38) 21) dialog: What? What?
38) 32) dialog: Alright Flash, what did you have in mind?
38) 40) dialog: So what is the plan then? SHAUN flips up his cricket bat and gathers himself.
38) 42) dialog: Where’s the car? HONK! The Jag pulls up, knocking a ROADSWEEPER ZOMBIE flying...
38) 45) dialog: Hello.
38) 63) dialog: What makes it so secure?
38) 65) dialog: Several.
38) 101) dialog: What’s wrong?
38) 117) dialog: What about the blunt objects?
39) 5) dialog: David!
39) 7) dialog: (whispering to Shaun) Do you though?
39) 9) dialog: But are we close? SHAUN peers through fence slats into a nearby garden. The MULLET HAIRED FIFTYSOMETHING from the pub lies dead on th grass surrounded by a ravenous huddle of FEMALE ZOMBIES.
39) 11) dialog: Is your Mum going to be okay?
39) 13) dialog: They’re in Antigua.
39) 15) dialog: I hope not.
39) 17) dialog: Shaun, you said this wasn’t about you and me.
39) 19) dialog: You said it was about survival.
39) 21) dialog: You're not doing all this just to prove something are you?
39) 23) dialog: Because, I meant everything I said last night. Nothing’s changed- A SCREAM in the distance is answered by a chorus of dista and not so distant moans which seem to surround them.
39) 24) dialog: Maybe this isn’t the best time to talk about it.
39) 31) dialog: Hey Yvonne. Haven’t seen you since... YVONNE replies with her dance again, then turns to her pa
39) 36) dialog: Yeah... SHAUN looks at the ground. YVONNE looks awkward.
44) 1) dialog: Shaun, are you okay? CRASH. SHAUN tumbles through the fence, struggling with t PYJAMA ZOMBIE.
44) 2) dialog: Oi! LIZ and DIANNE leap into action. DAVID panics. ED slopes around for a weapon, but LIZ is already brandishing a KID CHAIR. ED shrugs and backs off.
44) 3) dialog: Break it up! LIZ whacks the PYJAMA ZOMBIE, breaking the chair over its head. SHAUN gets to his feet and turns to see DAVID stand around and ED texting someone. SHAUN can’t believe it.
44) 11) dialog: Is it clear?
44) 13) dialog: How many?
44) 18) dialog: This is hardly constructive David!
44) 24) dialog: Will you stop it!
45) 5) text: I can’t see them. More ZOMBIES cotton on to the GANG’s noise. LIZ looks BARBARA who is now rifling around in her handbag.
45) 6) dialog: Is everything okay Barbara?
45) 8) dialog: Shaun, we have to get inside.
45) 12) dialog: Is there another way in Shaun?
45) 19) dialog: Shaun-
45) 21) dialog: Shaun... SHAUN turns to see EVERY SINGLE ZOMBIE LOOKING AT THEM.
45) 22) dialog: You were saying about another way in?
45) 24) dialog: 
45) 30) dialog: What do you mean, “do something”? SHAUN makes a big decision. He runs over to a picnic tabl

46) 2) dialog: No Barbara.
46) 9) dialog: David, wait- DAVID goes ahead and flips the switches. Nothing happens.

46) 13) dialog: Do we David?
46) 20) dialog: He’1l be back soon.
46) 26) dialog: Look, let’s just keep quiet and wait for Shaun. We can barricade the window when he gets back.
46) 33) dialog: He’s coming back.
46) 35) dialog: I DON’T KNOW DAVID! I don’t know anymore than you do. What I do know is that we’re here now and we have to make the best of it. (takes a breath) Ed, get me adouble vodka.
46) 41) dialog: David-
46) 55) dialog: Nice of you to join us.
46) 73) dialog: So what’s the plan then?
47) 21) dialog: What about the lights?
48) 1) dialog: That’s it! 98. Curious, SHAUN peers out into the dark. He finds the rele switch and flips on the garden light. ZOMBIES...LOTS OF THEM. SHAUN snaps off the light and yan down the door blind in a moment of panicked denial. He ru back to the bar, past the door marked ‘PRIVATE’. Unseen by SHAUN, the DOOR HANDLE now TWITCHES...
49) 0) text: SHAUN returns to the bar, slamming the back door behind h DIANNE stood on a bar stool, flipping through the channel the wall-mounted television. We see the message- ‘STANDBY FOR FURTHER INFORMATION’ -displayed on every single channel. Only the fonts differ The BBC, very austere, MIV, very funky etc. Everyone star at the TV with growing concern. ED sidles up to LIZ.
49) 2) dialog: Um...yeah. LIZ gives ED a pound. He thanks with a smile. She smiles back. ED goes off. SHAUN returns. She nods to the TV.
49) 3) dialog: There’s never anything on is there? SHAUN says nothing. He looks ashen faced and guilty.
49) 4) dialog: What? SHAUN glances to the back door.

54) 116) dialog: Ed, don’t exacerbate things.
54) 122) dialog: Can we just stop and think about this?
54) 139) dialog: (incredulous) David, please! There are slightly more pressing matters at hand here.
54) 157) dialog: 
54) 159) dialog: Now, I can see what David is trying to say...
54) 161) dialog: ...even if he is being a twat.

ED slumps against the wall, the beer cloth already sodden with blood. LIZ grabs some linen from the washing line an uses it to bandage ED’s wounds. In the far corner of the cellar, a shaft of orange street light illuminates the outline of the BARREL HATCH.
55) 5) dialog: Shaun.
55) 8) dialog: No you haven't.
55) 10) dialog: You shouldn’t feel so responsible. You tried. You did something. That’s what counts. God knows where we'd be if you hadn’t.

55) 27) dialog: What makes you think I’ve taken you back? The CELLAR DOOR buckles. The COPPER PIPE BENDS.
