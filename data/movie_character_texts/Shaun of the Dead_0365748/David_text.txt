0) 25) dialog: That’s alright. That’s alright. We reveal DAVID and DIANNE, sitting next to LIZ. Both in their late twenties, DAVID is trendy but straight-laced, is colourful and chirpy. They hold hands.
0) 29) dialog: No thanks. No thanks.
0) 32) dialog: I know friends are important Shaun, but you've got to set aside quality time for just the two of you. I know I would, if I was Lizzy’s boyfriend. DAVID looks at LIZ with affection, as DIANNE chips in.
0) 38) dialog: It was last week.
0) 50) dialog: You still haven’t met his Mum?
0) 52) dialog: I can’t believe you haven’t met his mum.
0) 56) dialog: Are you ashamed of your Mum, Shaun?
0) 62) dialog: Shaun-
14) 5) dialog: Lizzy doesn’t want to see you, Shaun.
14) 7) dialog: She doesn’t want to see you. Furious, SHAUN looks up to the FIRST FLOOR WINDOW. 25.
15) 0) text: A worried DAVID and DIANNE stand by the entry phone, in t coats. Behind, LIZ emerges, also preparing to go out.
16) 0) text: DAVID and DAVID and DI sit on the sofa, listening through the wall.
16) 14) dialog: (disdainfully) At a rave.
16) 22) dialog: Basically, I think your nine lives are up- 28.
16) 24) dialog: I don’t know what you mean by that. SHAUN makes a ‘like you don’t know’ face and leaves.
16) 25) dialog: I don’t know what he means by that. DIANNE says nothing. INT. LIZ’S ROOM -CONTINUOUS LIZ is sat on her bed. Head in her hands. SHAUN enters.
38) 0) text: A worried DAVID and DIANNE huddle round the entry phone, which buzzes with sounds of PITCH BATTLE. LIZ emerges fro her room and joins them. There is a noise at the window- It’s SHAUN. At the glass.
38) 8) dialog: What do you mean safe? We were perfectly safe until you turned up.
38) 10) dialog: But there were only two of them outside a minute ago and now how many are there?
38) 12) dialog: Lots.
38) 22) dialog: What?
38) 24) dialog: I’m not going out there.
38) 26) dialog: I’m not going if Lizzy isn’t going.
38) 28) dialog: I’m not staying here on my own.
38) 30) dialog: Lizzy?
38) 38) dialog: I don’t think there’s any point owning a car in London.
38) 60) dialog: I still don’t actually understand why we are going to The Winchester. SHAUN looks at LIZ. They keep eye contact.
38) 67) dialog: I would think that’s deactivated.
38) 109) dialog: It won’t open! 76.
38) 113) dialog: Now what? The GANG are out in the open. The HARD HOUSE draws the attention of several nearby ZOMBIES, who begin to close i
38) 126) dialog: You're not seriously suggesting we walk are you?
39) 4) dialog: Do you have any idea where you’re going?
39) 6) dialog: Sorry Lizzy. 78.
39) 34) dialog: They’ve broken up.
40) 2) dialog: ‘Just over there’? What about the twenty garden fences? We CRANE DOWN to reveal a line of back gardens. SHAUN ste forward and peers into the next garden.
41) 1) dialog: Of course, in reality, we are trespassing. Am I right, Lizzy? LIZ doesn’t answer. She is distracted by evidence of othe lives affected by the crisis...a dog sitting next to a DE BODY...the twitching silhouette of a HANGED MAN...a ZOMBI PYJAMAS clawing at PATIO DOORS.
44) 7) dialog: I didn’t want to cramp your style. Incredulous, SHAUN shakes his head. He walks over to a child’s slide, by the fence.
44) 15) dialog: Oh well, that’s just great.
44) 17) dialog: I trust Shaun has another genius scheme up his sleeve?
44) 19) dialog: No Lizzy, this is a waste of time. We should have stayed at the flat.
44) 21) dialog: Because-
44) 23) dialog: Because of...Captain Wow!
44) 34) dialog: I feel silly.
45) 9) dialog: Break the window.
45) 11) dialog: We are totally exposed. Break the window.
45) 26) dialog: Get inside!
45) 28) dialog: What?
45) 35) dialog: Shall we go in then? As the GANG move toward the pub, BARBARA picks up the bun of flowers from the strewn rubbish and looks at the card.
46) 0) text: CAMERA PANS 360 round the pub lounge. It’s deserted, lit by fading shafts of daylight. The curtains have been draw over the broken window and billow ominously. We find LIZ DIANNE sitting silently with BARBARA staring at the openi ED stands forlornly by the fruit machine. DAVID paces. 90.
46) 3) dialog: It’s a good twenty minutes since he went.
46) 5) dialog: Either way we should think about blocking up the window. We’re totally exposed.
46) 7) dialog: I’m sure he’1l knock. Nobody moves. We can hear DISTANT MOANS outside.
46) 8) dialog: Oh for goodness sakes, let’s at least get some lights on. DAVID strides over to some light switches. LIZ leaps up.
46) 10) dialog: Power's off.
46) 12) dialog: No of course not-
46) 14) dialog: No, of course not Lizzy. I’m just trying to be pro- active. (MORE )
46) 16) dialog: We have to face some facts here; the power and phones are off, there’s no sign of the owners and there’s a bloody great hole in the window.
46) 18) dialog: Someone had to make a decision. I don’t know if you noticed but we were in a spot of bother back there. Somebody needs to take control of this situation and if no- one else is prepared to take on that responsibility, then perhaps I should. Nobody speaks. Again we hear the DISTANT MOANS.
46) 21) dialog: How can you know that? How do we know he’s even coming back?
46) 23) dialog: Wouldn’t he? Lizzy, are you really going to put your faith in a man who last night you spectacularly binned for, among other things, being unreliable? A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot and an impenetrable fortress are the same thing. A pub. We are in a pub. What the hell are we going to do?
46) 27) dialog: Ok, then what? I mean how long are we going to be here? Hours? Weeks? What about food? What are we going to eat?
46) 30) dialog: Phew, that’s okay then. Oh wait, there’s no power!
46) 32) dialog: Well as long as we’ve got nibbles, we're saved. That must be why Shaun dragged us here. Dragged us here and buggered off.
46) 34) dialog: Why, because he promised? Even if he does come back, do you really think his master plan will extend to anything more than sitting in the dark eating peanuts? He’s gonna stroll on in and make everything okay is he? He’s-
46) 39) dialog: Yeah, fuck it. Let’s all get bladdered shall we? Great idea. Why don’t we have some nibbles while we're at it? DAVID flounces behind the bar and rifles through boxes of snacks, before petulantly throwing them out into the loun
46) 40) dialog: We've got Mini Chedders....
46) 42) dialog: We've got Twiglets...
46) 44) dialog: ...we've got ‘Hog Lumps’... A HAND SNATCHES THEM FROM MID-AIR! A perfect catch.
46) 57) dialog: How did you lose them?
46) 59) dialog: So you haven’t been bitten then?
46) 61) dialog: Yes.
46) 63) dialog: And what's that? 95.
46) 65) dialog: And how did you get in?
46) 67) dialog: What stopped you?
46) 69) dialog: I wasn’t the one blowing our cover by having a tiff with my boyfriend.
47) 19) dialog: It’s not, I’ve already tried it.
47) 22) dialog: Yes, we don’t really want to advertise our whereabouts more than we already have. We may as well put a sign outside saying ‘All You Can Eat’.
49) 18) dialog: Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit! Everyone scatters as ZOMBIE JOHN LURCHES TOWARD THEM.
49) 27) dialog: What?
49) 40) dialog: I can’t find the switch!
50) 0) text: DAVID sees the fuse box. Panicked, he hits everything.
53) 0) text: DAVID desperately flicks more switches. The back yard lig comes on, throwing ZOMBIE SHADOWS onto the blind. DAVID freaks out and backs away, moving past the door marked ‘PRIVATE’ which is now slowly opening to reveal ZOMBIE BERNIE. In her slippers. DAVID yelps and retreats into-
54) 0) text: DAVID slams the corridor door and barricades it with chai
54) 2) dialog: I couldn’t find the switch! ZOMBIE JOHN rounds on LIZ, pushing her backwards over a table. ED gives up his broken cue and runs off.
54) 18) dialog: I'm a pacifist.
54) 31) dialog: How can five people operate one gun?
54) 56) dialog: Here they come! CRASH. The barricade of chairs and tables topples. Hands at the curtains. SHAUN has no choice, but to fight.
54) 61) dialog: Is it the safety button?
54) 72) dialog: 
54) 89) dialog: What the hell’s going on? (shouting to the others)
54) 93) dialog: I know first aid!
54) 102) dialog: We have to deal with her.
54) 105) dialog: She’s going to come back.
54) 107) dialog: She’s gonna change.
54) 109) dialog: She’s a zombie. SHAUN positions himself between BARBARA and the rifle.
54) 112) dialog: Move away. I’m going to count to- SHAUN leaps up, GRABS A BOTTLE FROM THE TABLE AND SMASHES He holds the broken bottle to DAVID’s throat.
54) 124) dialog: Tell him to take the bottle away from my throat.
54) 126) dialog: She’s going to change Lizzy. She’1l change and kill us all. You know I’m right. Your ex can’t seem to grasp that.
54) 128) dialog: She's not-
54) 130) dialog: What are you talking about?
54) 132) dialog: That is not true.
54) 134) dialog: (to Dianne) It’s not true!
54) 136) dialog: What?! 113.
54) 138) dialog: Liz, I want you to know that my feelings for you are essentially-
54) 141) dialog: I’m not the one being unreasonable ‘Pickle’.
54) 143) dialog: You said it yourself about your stepdad.
54) 145) dialog: She’s finished. Stop being such a hypocrite!
54) 147) dialog: I’m not a Chartered Accountant!
54) 150) dialog: I’m a lecturer!
54) 153) dialog: She’s not your Mum anymore! Any second now she’1l be just another zombie.
54) 160) dialog: Thank you Lizzy.
54) 165) dialog: You do it! Do it! BARBARA looks at DAVID, her expression twists into a scow ZOMBIE BARBARA hisses and LUNGES FORWARD.
54) 167) dialog: Well, I think we’re all agreed that you did the right thing there. DAVID replaces his glasses. CRACK! SHAUN punches him hard the face, sending him sprawling. DAVID rolls over, he now the rifle in his hands, HE POINTS IT AT SHAUN.
54) 170) dialog: Right, I’m leaving.
54) 172) dialog: Not staying here. DAVID walks to the BOLTED FRONT DOOR and starts to move t tables and chairs away. The NOISE outside RISES. 116.
54) 174) dialog: What, and you will in here? DAVID begins UNLOCKING THE DEADBOLTS to the front door.
54) 177) dialog: We will. We can run. (picks up a broken pool cue) We can defend ourselves.
54) 179) dialog: What do you mean, ‘what do you mean we’?
54) 181) dialog: So, you're staying here? With him?
54) 183) dialog: After all he’s got us into!
54) 185) dialog: Dianne, how-
54) 190) dialog: But-—
54) 192) dialog: DAVID crumples, the pool cue dropping from his hand. He s away from the door and slumps against the window in tears
54) 193) dialog: I’m sorry Dianne. I’m sorry Lizzy.
54) 195) dialog: I’m sorry Shaun. SHAUN nods. Silently accepting the apology.
54) 198) dialog: Still holding David's leg, DIANNE gets up and runs straig to the front door; UNLOCKING THE FINAL DEADBOLT!
57) 0) text: Bare feet lumber into shot. Slowly we PAN UP. SHAUN. His is tired, but happy. He yawns. We are back in the lounge. The room is tidy, but the deco little different. More homely. There are photos of Shaun Liz on the wall, next to two mounted rifles and posters advertising a club at which Shaun now Deejays. 130. We also see pictures of David and Di and Barbara and Phil arranged like little shrines. LIZ sits on the sofa, idly flicking through the cable channels. She is wearing BARBARA’S RING. SHAUN kisses her
