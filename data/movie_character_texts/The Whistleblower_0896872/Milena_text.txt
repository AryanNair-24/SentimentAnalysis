60) 0) text: The shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright.
60) 1) dialog: These girls are told they have been bought and must repay the debt. They are told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll be let go when they earn back that money. But they never are. Kathy stares at her, taken aback.

INSIDE THE ROOM: A VOLUNTEER NURSE sits by Raya's bed. She lies asleep. IN ANOTHER BED: Irka sleeps. Kathy watches. Hushed...
60) 19) dialog: Try the Global Displacement Agency. They have good medical care, lots of funding. They might take them. Whether they'll keep them or not... I don't know.
