0) 588) dialog: OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid. Bob stops walking.
0) 590) dialog: That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out. Pause. Bob gets into the backseat. Dignan looks back at h for a minute.
