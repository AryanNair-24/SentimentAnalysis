Miss Huller steps into view behind Ve degast and Tanner. The women recline in their chairs, cha ting over what they like. AN IMAGE flashes in Susie’s head next: Detective Halle ra up in some kind of web. His mouth is covered with it, so is silent. He hangs in a restless void, in some kind of s tained animal release.

Thank God you do not have them. >> Caroline is beginning to tear up, looking more and more d perate. Susie watches this in her mirror.

Susie slowly lets go of her concern for Sara and becomes dance. Everything begins to fade for Susie except the spe in the air she is creating with her movements, and Blanc is in one of the wings connecting with her in her mind. A is the dance. All is the dance. The piece is remarkable, giving the audience the feeling an entire community shattered, but still functioning.
