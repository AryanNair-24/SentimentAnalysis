The Twin Moons appear almost as halves rather than wholes, fragments of a form... Now we know tis but a trick of the eye and yon moons drift complete as ever... Looks can be decieving.

When we fulfill the prophecy together I hope that it can be an act of love as opposed to, well, you know, rape. Rape is so rude. In the meantime... make yourself at home.
