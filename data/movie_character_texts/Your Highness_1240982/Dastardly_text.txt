26) 17) dialog: Aggressive MUSIC KICKS in. A fully clothed man, well built and extraordinarily good looking: DASTARDLY enters with long 80’s rockstar hair. He is heavily armed with daggers, swords’ and leather accessories. The crowd goes wild. Dastardly begins what seems to be some sort of medieval strip tease as he juggles knives and gyrates in sexual gestures that seem dangerous considering the sharp metal he’s playing with. He stalks one of the prisoners and after some fancy sword spinning, he stab him to the death and then takes his shirt off. The crowd sweats in their cages.
