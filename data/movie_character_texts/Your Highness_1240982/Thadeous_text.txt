25) 15) dialog: I'll get rid of Courtney. I'11 push him into that quicksand right now if it means fair is fair.
25) 49) dialog: (singing) Not even fatigue could dampen the raging fire of revenge. Thadeous wished for the traitors lives to end... He swore he would... uh, I’m drawing a blank.
25) 51) dialog: No. Something bolder. He swore he would slash their faces with cuts from his sword! Fabious who's been listening the whole time begins to sing without even looking back at them.
25) 53) dialog: That, Courtney. Write that down. That’s what brave Prince Thadeous swore to do. Not bad Brother. Not bad at all.
25) 58) dialog: Whoa! Who the hell is that? The beauty smiles and summons him with her finger. She turns and disappears behind some trees. Thadeous climbs off his horse to follow her.

26) 18) dialog: Oh shit, I don’t like this a bit!
26) 20) dialog: Of course!
26) 24) dialog: I will... keep doing quest. A blade is thrown at Thadeous. With lighting fast speed, Fabious pushes Thad out of the way and snatches the blade. He jumps into the center of the arena. Dastardly bumps and grinds and feeds the crowd kisses. Marteetee blows kisses right back and drinks a goblet of wine. Without skipping a beat, Fabious maneuvers weaponless, trying to find his entrance to the fight as Dastardly dances and tosses his long hair around. Fabious makes a graceful rampage approach as he runs and leaps off a rock, tumbles on the ground, uses his leg to sweep the leg out from under Dastardly. He quickly grabs one of his swords and gets to his feet. Dastardly finds his stance as well and the fight is on. As the even match continues, we see why he is the warrior and hero called upon for a lifetime of adventure. - When Dastardly falls with a blade through his heart... Fabious raises his arms in bloodthirsty victory. THADEOUS (CONT’D) Oh Gods... I can’t breathe. That was insane. Where did you learn how to do that? Fabious spits. The crowd hushes. Marteetee stirs...
26) 29) dialog: Observe this unsightly freak. I will gouge him with my finger and show that true bravery runs in our family. In an instant, as its legs and head remain still, the torso of the monster turns 180 degrees to reveal the alter-ego of this two faced beast: Hideous and far more sinister features... Thadeous and Courtney scream bloody murder as they run for it. Nipple-Eye comes at them quick... Fabious tries to keep up but loses his footing, and jumps to the left just as Nipple-Eye pierces the Skinny Prisoner with the reveal of its switchblade bone arm. The CROWD CHEERS and bangs on their bars COURTNEY AND THADEOUS run to the far side of the cave... THADEOUS (CONT’D) Drop back! The slowest one gets eaten. Make the sacrifice, Courtney!
26) 31) dialog: Fabious, quick, do more of that fighting! Nipple-eye corners Fabious... Fabious freezes. The beast slinks back... then it opens its jaw. A very long TONGUE ejects from within. The tongue shoots out of Nipple-Eye’s mouth and slaps the sword out of Fabious’ hand, before he can move the tongue wraps around his neck! Fabious fights and plays tug-of-war with the tongue, as Nipple Eye tries to pull him within reach. Marteetee and the crowd CHEER!
26) 35) dialog: I can’t-- I
26) 44) dialog: No, no. We killed the last one, we did our share. It’s that asshole’s turn to fight now. Nipple Eye turns from The Prisoner and ROARS at them. It rears back about to charge the royal brothers when- The Hooded Prisoner jumps onto the creature’s back. GREEN BLOOD pours out as the warrior drills the sword into the back of the monster’s vulnerable neck tissue. The monster drops in a fit of spasms. Dead. The mysterious warrior cuts off a SIX INCH SPIKE that grows on the beast’s back and holds it up in victory. Marteetee throws a tantrum in the stands.
26) 50) dialog: She's incredible.
26) 52) dialog: She seems to be doing fine on her own. Nipple Eye SPRINGS BACK TO LIFE! It screams as it rises for the attack again! Thadeous screams as he sees the massive bone blade swinging his way, hot on his ass! It flails around in seizure, crashing right into the holding cells of the prisoners. The weight of his massive frame CRUSHES the small structures, FREEING THE PRISONERS. Nipple-Eye ricochets toward the balcony and knocks over a support post. The balcony collapses on top of the beast, spilling Marteetee onto the arena floor. He screams like a bitch as his escaped captives devour him.
27) 0) text: The gang, now armed, comes running out of the woods, to a clearing by a waterfall. They catch their breath. Thadeous and Isabel circle each other.

35) 42) dialog: No, mother fucker, we have nothing to do with cheeses!
35) 48) dialog: (ignoring him) Isabel may I speak to you outside for a moment?
35) 50) dialog: Put a fucking shirt on!
35) 52) dialog: Well I may not be able to provide you with that small offering but I can give you this... He pulls out another folded up piece of parchment.
35) 53) dialog: A song, that I wrote... From my heart.
35) 56) dialog: I wrote it after you left and my heart had a hole in it. T’is called: NIGHT WARRIORS. My minstrel Courtney will perform it. He is a trained artiste. Thadeous hands Courtney the lyrics. The Bartender hands him a lyre. Thadeous locks eyes, with Isabel.
35) 57) dialog: Every word, Courtney. Courtney hesitantly strums. The bar goes silent and all eyes turn to our heroes. Thad looks to Isabel and nods.
35) 65) dialog: (singing)
35) 73) dialog: No. See?! I knocked out an elf! Suddenly FIVE ENRAGED LITTLE PEOPLE emerge from a trap door in the floor launching a chain reaction of CHAOS. The entire bar BEGINS FIGHTING. An old school BAR ROOM
35) 78) dialog: Did you not like my poem? Adam swings one last punch, knocking Thadeous down. He collapses on the floor.
35) 82) dialog: Those are simply emotional walls she has built to ease the pain of our departure. Come, let us find The Blade of Unicorns. Let us rescue Belladonna! He stumbles, dizzy, drunk.
35) 85) dialog: On second thought... Maybe we should get a good night’s sleep first. He blacks out.
37) 26) dialog: Is that what you truly think of me, Brother?
38) 0) text: Thadeous and Courtney run like the wind. Thadeous stops, turns to Courtney, drops to his knees.
38) 1) dialog: Oh gods, Courtney, what has befallen us? What do we do? Thadeous drops to his knees and screams to the heavens. THADEOUS (CONT’D)
38) 6) dialog: Or maybe it’s some other cave. Both their eyes find the aged wooden sign that reads, ENCHANTED CAVE.
38) 8) dialog: Let us forget we ever saw this place.
38) 10) dialog: Don’t ever say his name in my presence again. You heard what he said about me!
38) 12) dialog: Of course not. But he’s changed. I swear to you. Never have I heard such vulgarities!
38) 14) dialog: (Getting angrier) There was no such insight said by stupid Fabious who is always
38) 19) dialog: FABIOUS who everyone LOVES, and always looks out for me, and has always been there... when I’ve needed him, and... Oh gods, Courtney, you’re right. Oh gods!
38) 21) dialog: You must turn away. I’m having an embarrassing... epiphany. Courtney turns away. With utter dread, Thadeous realizes- THADEOUS (CONT’D)
38) 24) dialog: Shut up! Thadeous stomps around in a circle, torn/frustrated. He then stops and looks to the opening of the Enchanted Cave. A low howl blows from it’s depths. THADEOUS (CONT’D) Fine!
39) 0) text: Thadeous walks into the dark cavern. Fog and large spider webs fill the interior. Courtney stays behind at the entrance holding the broken remains of Simon.
39) 1) dialog: And is the sword just suppose to be sitting in here somewhere?
39) 3) dialog: Well, we’ll find out won’t we. Just then the fog begins to grow thicker. THADEOUS (CONT’D) Courtney? Into the cavern full of jagged rocks. Within the hollow chamber, he hears a faint echoes of familiar voices: (CONTTNIED )
39) 9) dialog: Away with you, child. This is no place for androgenous sprites such as yourself. (pulls up his pants) This is a journeyman’s cavern. For men like me. Prince Thadeous! - BE
39) 12) dialog: How dare you... His hand rearing back to strike the boy, when--
39) 14) dialog: I am Thadeous! (CONTTNUED )
39) 17) dialog: I am Thadeous!
39) 18) dialog: I am Tha-dreous!
39) 19) dialog: Shut up! All the versions of Thadeous laugh at him.
39) 22) dialog: Mother? What great sorcery brings us together? Can this be..?
39) 24) dialog: But the quest for the blade, my brother, his love... the kingdom.
39) 28) dialog: You’re not my mother. He suddenly THROWS A PUNCH! Flinching at the show of force, the Beautiful maiden’s face contorts for impact, instinctively MORPHING back into it’s true form - The face of a LEEZAR MOTHER #1. The gig is up. THADEOUS (CONT’D) You devil wench! (points to himself) You attempt to fool ME? The master of illusion and entertainments!? Leezar’s Mother lashes out at Thadeous.
39) 30) dialog: I will not fail.
39) 32) dialog: Huh-uh! Enraged, Thadeous leans back. Now, with all his might, he PUNCHES THROUGH THE MIRROR... shattering his own reflection. Just then the whole cave begins to rumble. Thadeous covers his ears as knife-like shards of the mirror fall around him. Thadeous looks up stunned. As the smoke and debris settles, there, where the mirror once stood, lies a DOORWAY - Beyond it, a shaft of light streams from within. Collecting himself, he walks through... The gnarled rocks of the cave seem to fall away from this enclave, as the light adorns TREASURES and GOLD from ancient civilizations past. Thadeous is overwhelmed. Walking through the piled wealth, Thadeous’ eyes are suddenly drawn to the wall - The SKULL OF A UNICORN gazes into the beyond, mounted on the top of a sarcophagus. (CONTTNUED )
39) 35) dialog: I ask those who are doubtful to look upon me now! To gaze upon Lord Thadeous and dare speak their ghastly ills! Only a champion would hold the Blade of Unicorn in his hands! - And I, the real Thadeous, is that man!!! Music floods the cavern along with the rainbow light.
40) 0) text: Courtney fixes Simon like a jigsaw puzzle. Simon BLEEPS happily and begins flapping it’s clunky wounded wings. Wavering in the air ERRATICALLY LIKE he’s shit-housed. +.-out of the cave storms Thadeous. He raises the Sword of the Unicorn above his head. The afternoon sun catching the powerful blade just right.
40) 1) dialog: Let’s quest motherfucker. Courtney applauds him proudly. INT. LEEZAR‘S DUNGEON - NIGHT 57 In this TORTURE CHAMBER of sorts, Fabious is chained to the wall with his shirt off and his arms outstretched, Julie whips him and snickers. A GUARD inspects hot coals.
41) 0) text: In a small wooden boat. Under the mind of new found confidence, Thadeous and Courtney row across a creepy bog. Simon chirps at the head of the boat leading them through the fog. The boat then bumps onto land. The fog clears revealing... LEEZAR'S LAIR a tall.and large castle made of BLACK ROCK, many towers and spires reach into the heavens. There is a gate made of SHRUBBERY surrounding a large WOODEN DOOR. Thadeous sizes up TWO GUARDS that stand at the gate and without hesitation, he takes The Blade of Unicorns and impales them.

A_LOUD BEASTLY HUFF OF AIR echoes over them and lingers through the maze!!! From the FAR END of the PATH, they hear a loud GROWL. They turn to see a LARGE AND DAUNTING FIGURE. AN UNEARTHLY SHRIEK blasts at them. Out of the shadows charges A MINOTAUR: a man body, with the hideous head of a bull AND HIS DICK HANGING OUT! It RUNS AT THEM COUGHING...
42) 5) dialog: Did you see that?! Did you see it?!
42) 7) dialog: Trying to take a souvenir of the kill. I wish to make a necklace, but this horn is proving to be a bit of a bitch!
44) 0) text: Thadeous and Courtney enter the front gate into a foyer of stone ruins. Thadeous with sword in hand and the MINOTAUR’S DICK as a necklace. He shuts his eyes, and holds out his sword, as if it’s going to direct him. Nothing. THEN, from their left, they hear the loud STOMP OF MARCHING FOOT STEPS. They hide behind STATUES as TEN MASKED MINIONS MARCH BY. After they pass, ONE MINION TURNS AROUND... Thadeous and Courtney freeze as THEY ARE SPOTTED. Whispers turn to NOISE...then in a FLURRY OF BLADES, A MINION in the center turns and cuts the other MINIONS down. Thadeous and Courtney are stunned. The Minion looks up and then rips off its MASK. Stepping forward into the light, we see that it is ISABEL IN THE FLESH!
44) 2) dialog: I know you.
44) 6) dialog: You’re at the end of your quest? I’m at the end of my quest, to save my brother and his bride.

45) 7) dialog: Yes! Are you surprised?
45) 11) dialog: 
45) 18) dialog: That was impressive, but you should have been there when I fought bravely through the Labyrinth.
45) 20) dialog: Yes.
45) 23) dialog: I know. I killed him. Thadeous holds up the Minotaur dick that hangs from his neck. Fabious nods, impressed.
46) 7) dialog: Tis merely a truce after Courtney had him restored! Simon, what news dos’t thou bring? Simon BEEPS, Thadeous shakes his head.
46) 11) dialog: Fabious you have never asked of me for a single thing. I will stand with you on this night.
46) 13) dialog: Brother...I did not deserve to be your best man. The two fall into one hell of a handshake. Courtney's eyes brimming with tears. Isabel motions to the stairs.
46) 17) dialog: Ready! INT. LEEZAR’S OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS 67 The Mothers of the Dark Realm BEGIN CHANTING. Belladonna is strapped down, Leezar grins and rubs himself. Julie stands excited beside Boremont, holding a large TEACUP.

THE SONS OF KING TALLIOUS ROAR and charge into battle! Courtney and Isabel joining in. Fabious vs. Boremont Thadeous vs. Julie Isabel and Courtney vs. The 4 Mothers. Belladonna struggles to break free from her straps. Leezar approaches her with sexual hunger. The ceiling of the chamber is open. The TWIN MOONS as ONE illuminating THE ALTAR. Leezar removes his cloak and seductively walks towards her wearing a robe. The light of the moons illuminating his pale frame. He holds his staff up and bolts of lightning shoot from the tip.
46) 63) dialog: Did he just lay a fucking egg?
46) 66) dialog: If there’s one lesson to be learned in this tale it’s to never judge a book by its cover. Sure the second born Prince may seem like a good for nothing, but when put to the test, he pulls through just fine. What if the same be true for this poor creature? Thadeous leans in close to the CREATURE. THADEOUS (CONT’D) Shall we learn nothing?
47) 1) dialog: Courtney I want you to forget none of this. I expect you to have this tale memorized and perhaps choreographed to present to the kingdom upon our return.
47) 4) dialog: You've battled with honor. Why don’t you treat yourself and take rest back at our castle. We have pickles, slaves, and all the herbs you care to smoke.

50) 3) dialog: Even me?
51) 0) text: The COURTYARD is decked out once again for a royal wedding. The reception is underway. Fabious and Belladonna dance in front of the crowd and kiss, husband and wife. She dances worse than your average white girl. Courtney, Tumblebottom and the elves spin a choreographed Mime Routine of the Adventure. Thadeous watches proudly next to his father King Tallious.
51) 2) dialog: Well, I'd be remiss if I said I did it alone. Fabious did contribute what he could. Tallious points to Belladonna and Fabious kissing.
51) 4) dialog: Barring that another demented wizard doesn’t kidnap her and then have his head bitten off by a dragon's asshole... I'd say yes. Tallious puts his arm on Thadeous’ shoulder. Thadeous smiles. Finally respect. The moment is well earned. Feeling good. King still has his hand on shoulder. Thadeous still just stands there. No one says anything. Great moment gets a little awkward as we stay just a little too long, until--
51) 5) dialog: I'm going to get another drink. You need anything?
51) 7) dialog: Ah, lady warrior. His eyes are squinted shut. THADEOUS (CONT’D) You came back. And now you want me to pleasure you.
51) 9) dialog: Isabel? Fabious smiles and presents... STEVEN, the fat lizard animal companion that Thadeous and YOU have long since forgotten.
51) 11) dialog: Steven? Fabious puts Steven on Thadeous’ lap. He’s obviously disappointed, but instead of throwing a tantrum, he merely smiles and looks up to Fabious.
51) 12) dialog: Thank you, Fabious. Simon squawks in the corner.
51) 15) dialog: Still doesn’t mean you are allowed in my bedroom, Simon.
51) 17) dialog: Well, Steven, real handy you ended up being. Go sit in the corner while I finish strumming my filthies. Thadeous dumps Steven on the ground. He looks up, and there standing in the flesh is ISABEL. THADEOUS (CONT’D) Oh Jesus!
51) 19) dialog: Oh weird. I was just about to finish thinking of you. The two begin kissing passionately.
51) 21) dialog: And what might that be? She rips open her dress to reveal a STEEL CHASTITY BELT.
51) 23) dialog: What a horribly cruel thing to do!
51) 28) dialog: So in order for me to have sex with you we have to go on another quest and kill some bitch?
51) 30) dialog: Right now?
51) 32) dialog: Lady warrior. Of course I want to come, but we just got home’ and-
51) 34) dialog: Come on. Let’s not fight. Just give me five minutes. That’s all I want... Just to do nothing. She just looks at him. He tries to relax but can’t.
51) 35) dialog: Oh, fuckery. Let’s go! ROLL CREDITS, BITCH.
