1) 4) dialog: What "stuff"? This party isn't going to be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a wing platter from Costco?
1) 8) dialog: No you won't. Because I'm going to scrape the batter off.
1) 14) dialog: I went to medical school. You think I don't know how carbs work?
1) 17) dialog: Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any emergencies at the office this morning.
1) 19) dialog: 
1) 23) dialog: I did do that. I forgot about that. I need to get some batteries in there. Because dentists do have emergencies. We are doctors, you know? We take the same oath. The oath of saving lives. Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms. Billy swats his hand away.
2) 0) text: DOUG drives a Volvo station wagon along the streets of Cincinnati. BILLY is next to him, in the passenger seat, looking bored. Doug notices.
2) 1) dialog: You know, I use to race a car like this. Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw me coming.
2) 3) dialog: Yup. It could really... smoke some ass. Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This was a good time to break the "no saying ass" rule.
2) 4) dialog: Yes, sir. They called it the dragon wagon. You're lucky to be in here without a helmet, pal. We both are. Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars artificially. Billy is impressed.
2) 6) dialog: Heck yeah, you can jam the radio. Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.
3) 0) text: The Volvo pulls up to a red light. Radio Disney blares "MICKEY LOVES MAMBO" from the stereo. BILLY bobs his head along with the music. DOUG looks out the window and sees a mid-twenties guy in a Porsche, staring at him. Doug nods hello, then awkwardly faces forward.
11) 0) text: DOUG, now in his lab coat, sits at his desk, playing with a model of a mouth. The phone rings and Doug answers it.
11) 1) dialog: 
11) 4) dialog: Me? Oh, yeah. I've got a mouth right here in front of me. Doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic mouth.
11) 6) dialog: Well, it's not attached to a head, really. More research. Doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out. He fumbles to stop them from scattering everywhere.
11) 12) dialog: I don't know. Do you think we really need to stay at a hotel? I mean, Billy has his own room. Why don't we just buy new sheets? Like, hotel-colored ones. It'll be like the Ritz, but we won't have to pay to make phone calls!
11) 14) dialog: 
11) 15) dialog: What? I'm just saying-- Suddenly, the speaker comes on overhead.
11) 17) dialog: Emergency?
12) 0) text: Doug flies into an exam room, where a hygienist, DANA, is looking into a male patient's mouth.
12) 2) dialog: Acute molar abscess. That's going to need emergency surgery.
12) 8) dialog: Yeah.
13) 0) text: DOUG, looking depressed, pulls into the driveway. He looks over and sees BILLY and three of his friends shooting baskets. He smiles, gets out of the car and struts over.
13) 1) dialog: 
13) 3) dialog: Taking it into the paint. Who's got the D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya! Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug notices.
13) 4) dialog: Well, that's not really my shot. I usually hit from downtown, you know? Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back to the three point line.
13) 9) dialog: That's where the big games get won. Back here from the three-- Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it. It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his head, humiliated.
13) 10) dialog: That was a pass, dudes! It wasn't. Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside.
14) 0) text: DOUG enters and finds KELLY. She smiles and kisses him.
14) 2) dialog: I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go meet the guys for a beer.
14) 5) dialog: 
15) 0) text: Doug enters his bedroom and shuts the door behind him. He sits down on the bed and lets out a long sigh.
16) 0) text: The garage door on Doug's house rolls open like a theater curtain, and Doug, wearing the full leather biker getup, idles out of the garage on a gleaming, chromed-out Harley Davidson Fatboy. He looks around the neighborhood cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides into the street. The camera rotates around him and comes to rest on the back of his jacket, where we see a large patch that reads "Wild Hogs." The camera ZOOMS IN ON THIS, and it becomes:
17) 0) text: BOB creeps through the living room. From the kitchen, we can hear KAREN, HALEY and CLAIRE screaming things at him, about him, etc. He just tip-toes to the hall closet and opens the door. We don't see what's in it, but see Bob smile the same way Doug did, and...
18) 0) text: BOB, in leather biker gear, rolls out of his garage on another shimmering Harley Davidson. He looks around through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete bad ass. He looks down the street and spots DOUG, riding towards him. Bob rides down the driveway and joins alongside Doug. They nod silently to each other and tap fists like the toughest guys in the world. We see Bob is also wearing a "Wild Hogs" jacket.
21) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...
22) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all wearing "Wild Hogs" jackets. And on this, we:
23) 9) dialog: Guys! Come on. Let's go get a brew. I'm buying. Doug heads into the bar.
23) 11) dialog: 
24) 9) dialog: Hey, Paul. PAUL laughs at his joke.
24) 16) dialog: Because it's Bike Week. That's our annual trip, Woody. We're Wild Hogs.
24) 22) dialog: Hey! She took an embroidery class for those. What has your wife ever made us?
24) 27) dialog: It's not a big secret, Bob. She's a swimsuit model. She's hot. I mean, so is my Kelly. She's very hot. Even after ten years. Not that I'm not still good looking... Doug looks at the guys. They don't respond.
24) 29) dialog: Because it's gay, or because I'm not?
24) 35) dialog: I don't know. Good, I guess. Is ten the silver anniversary?
24) 41) dialog: Aluminum? Like, siding? (considers, then) Yeah, that feels about right. Aluminum is sturdy, lightweight... recycled. Woody smiles and puts a map down on the table.
24) 43) dialog: We don't need a map for Daytona. We just follow the group. Woody takes a drink from his beer, then looks at the group with a mischievous fire behind his eyes.
24) 45) dialog: What?
24) 48) dialog: No, it's not. It's the slogan for the Downtown trolley.
24) 56) dialog: Well, what kind of trip are you suggesting? Another bike week somewhere?
24) 64) dialog: Well, Daytona isn't the "backbone of America," but it is a tradition. We've been riding with this club for years. Do we really want to miss out on that? One of the bikers, KENT, approaches carrying a box.
24) 74) dialog: Look, We'll talk about it tomorrow. But we don't need some trip to go "live." We
25) 0) text: The anniversary party is in full swing. DOUG is watching
25) 2) dialog: 
25) 7) dialog: 
25) 14) dialog: oh.
25) 21) dialog: Oh, man. There should be laws against  that... Is Fred having a seizure? 
25) 23) dialog: Hey, we have fun all the time. But I'm not going to let myself look like that. He wears dress socks with shorts, too. I've seen it. Do you want me to do that?
25) 26) dialog: (sotto, to Kelly)  He's drunk. We should do something. 
25) 28) dialog: (sotto, to Kelly)  --No, he's fine. Let him talk. 
25) 39) dialog: No, no. No cheers-- Because that wasn't an accurate toast. I'm still the same, shitty son-in-law I used to be.
25) 48) dialog: 
25) 55) dialog: 
25) 63) dialog: So what are you saying?
25) 65) dialog: Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is lame. People like me need a fresh beat! Doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station. "Cand Sho " h y-50 Cent starts playing. Doug nods along with the beat, as the guests all now stare at him.
25) 66) dialog: (yelling over music) Awwww, yeah. This is the shit! It ain't 1980 anymore, man. Yeah!
25) 69) dialog: What!? I thought this was what you  wanted? I'm dancing! Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly  grits her teeth. 
25) 70) dialog: Come on, baby! Just because we're  married ten years doesn't mea n we're old  people. Let's dance! It fee ls goooood!  Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly  grimaces and grabs his chest.
25) 71) dialog: Nope, that feels bad--
25) 77) dialog: Yeah. I'm just-- Ow: That's-- Yeah, I should go to the hospital-- Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help him.
26) 0) text: Doug is in a bed, with Kelly next to him. A DOCTOR enters with a chart.
26) 2) dialog: Dr. Matthews, actually.
26) 4) dialog: 
26) 7) dialog: Stress-induced? I'm not stressed.
26) 9) dialog: I'm not middle-aged.
26) 15) dialog: I am middle aged, aren't I?
26) 18) dialog: What?
26) 25) dialog: I don't know. There's just a lot weighing me down these days, you know?
26) 30) dialog: 
26) 37) dialog: 
26) 40) dialog: I still have a thirty-- 
26) 43) dialog: We are going to be married fifty more years, Kelly. I'm going to find old Doug. I just have to figure out where to look. Kelly takes a breath, and pulls out a map. She hands it  to Doug, who looks at it. 
26) 44) dialog: Woody's map? 
26) 46) dialog: I thought you agreed it was a bad idea. 
26) 48) dialog: Really? (considers, then) I only got you an ankle bracelet.
26) 55) dialog: Yeah, I'm okay. Just stress.
26) 62) dialog: Bob. Let's forget about Daytona Bike week. Let's ride across U.S. 50.
26) 69) dialog: Yeah. I think that might be okay.
27) 0) text: DOUG is riding his Harley, which is loaded with gear (sleeping bag, spare gas tank, saddle bags). He approaches a freeway entrance ramp, where WOODY and DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes, next to an entrance ramp sign that reads: U.S. Highway 50. The guys all tap fists, then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear.
27) 6) dialog: Wow. That's...
27) 8) dialog: You're not wearing a helmet?
27) 10) dialog: You will if your head falls on it.
27) 16) dialog: Well, if we're going to make it in five days, we'll should probably get to Illinois by tonight.
27) 19) dialog: I do. I have this little GPS system. Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it and throws it into a storm drain.
27) 20) dialog: Hey! What the hell, man? That was expensive!
27) 22) dialog: Hah! How's that feel? Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles.
27) 29) dialog: 
27) 32) dialog: 
27) 35) dialog: So we're not even going to talk about this? I mean, shouldn't we at least--
27) 37) dialog: 
31) 0) text: The sun has gone down, and the guys have found a deserted area off the highway to set up camp. DOUG, WOODY and BOB lounge by a fire - with a tent set up behind them. Doug is roasting marshmallows and Bob is straining to blow up an air mattress.
31) 1) dialog: 
31) 9) dialog: Dudley? You're supposed to bury that.
31) 12) dialog: This is really nice, you know? Chilling by the fire with your best friends. Just relaxing, and enjoying--
31) 15) dialog: --each other's company... Dudley grabs the bag and heads off.
31) 18) dialog: Yup... These are the times we'll remember. After a minute, Doug turns to Woody and Bob.
31) 23) dialog: Hey, when was the last time you guys heard me sing Bon Jovi?
31) 26) dialog: Yeah, I know. Turns out there's carbs in the batter. Hey, you know what? Maybe carbs are what I need to get old Doug back.
31) 28) dialog: No. I think I've lost me. It's this thing Kelly said.
31) 31) dialog: A wimp?
31) 33) dialog: No. I just thought that was what you were... I thought you wanted us to guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I said "wimp." Knowing it was wrong...
31) 43) dialog: Yeah, I guess life just isn't as simple as it was when we were in college. Well, except for you, Woody. You're still living the fairy tale. Swimsuit model wife. Big job at an investment firm. You've got the good life. Woody doesn't respond. He just stares vacantly into the fire for a beat.
31) 61) dialog: We know, Bob.
31) 63) dialog: There's a surprise. Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire.
31) 64) dialog: All right, who wants their marshmallow well-done? The guys just look at it.
31) 65) dialog: Yeah, I left that one on too long. Doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying behind him. The guys don't notice - but we see the marshmallow land on the tent and continue to burn. Bob continues to huff on the air mattress. He stops and looks at it.
31) 72) dialog: 
31) 74) dialog: Shit! The tent-- Doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent.
31) 75) dialog: Dudley, get the water jug off my bike! Dudley hurries over to Doug's bike as Doug and Bob try to smother the flame with sand.
31) 76) dialog: It should be okay. It's fire retardant. The guys try and extinguish the flame as Dudley comes running with a jug. He quickly takes off the cap. Doug notices him.
31) 77) dialog: Dudley, no! That'sВ— It's too late. Dudley is already throwing it on the fire. The liquid hits the tent and it explodes into flames. The guys shield themselves.
31) 78) dialog: Gas! That's the spare gas tank, Dudley! Dudley doesn't know what to say. The fire quickly disentergrates the tent. Doug, Bob and Woody just watch, knowing there's nothing they can do. After a moment, DUDLEY runs back up with the correct water jug and empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash. It does nothing.
31) 80) dialog: That was all of it, Dudley. That was all the water we had.
32) 0) text: BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are all sleeping on Bob's air mattress, like four sardines. Doug opens his eyes to see a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress. It's a stern-looking highway patrolman.
32) 2) dialog: Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip.
32) 5) dialog: Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have a nice day, officer. The highway patrolman laughs.
32) 17) dialog: Please put your pants on.
35) 0) text: The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands, looking even hotter than before. Doug spots a waterfall pouring into a crystal clear spring, and points to it. The guys nod in agreement.
36) 0) text: DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up.
36) 6) dialog: Skivies? What are you, a Newsie?
36) 11) dialog: I guess I get that.
36) 18) dialog: I will find old Doug! Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up.
36) 23) dialog: Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I
36) 38) dialog: We should go.
37) 0) text: The guys are back on their bikes, cruising along the wheat fields of Kansas. They're looking tired once again, but suddenly Doug smiles... On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are several rows of Harley Davidsons. Doug points it out to the guys and they all smile. It's like an oasis. The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes. Bob immediately falls to the ground.
37) 3) dialog: You guys have to shift every once in awhile. Blood has to circulate. A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar.
37) 5) dialog: Look at these bikes. They're all classics.
37) 7) dialog: Yeah, but why didn't he customize it? You have a 51 panhead and you don't chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an eagle on the gas tank? What a waste.
38) 0) text: The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing. We see their jackets say "Hells Angels." The bikers turn and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY.
38) 1) dialog: 
38) 6) dialog: Well, not a gang. Just friends. Friends that ride... you know.
38) 22) dialog: 
38) 28) dialog: Dudley, maybe you should--
38) 34) dialog: 
39) 4) dialog: All right, guys. We get the joke... Good one. Anyway, we actually should get moving along.
39) 12) dialog: All right. We respect that this is your turf, and we're sorry for bothering you. But we can't head back without my friend's bike. So clearly we're going to have to work something out here. Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods.
40) 0) text: We see DOUG, BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar, looking very glum. The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the rusty sidecar is now attached to Woody's bike. DUDLEY sits in it looking miserable and cold (having lost his jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt). The guys get a good distance away from the bar and Woody waves for them to stop. They do and Woody looks back to the bar.
40) 7) dialog: The trip's over, Woody. Let's just head back home.
40) 9) dialog: Yes. Yes. Woody shakes his head and looks at Dudley.
40) 14) dialog: That's the point, Woody. Our lives aren't on this highway. They're back home. We have families, jobs, wives... or cats... We're not going to piss off a biker gang. We're going back. Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment
40) 15) dialog: Come on, Woody. You don't want to take this risk. You have Claudia, and your job... You have a great life back home.
41) 0) text: Woody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods.
42) 0) text: WOODY pulls up on his bike, where DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are waiting.
42) 13) dialog: You really said that?
46) 2) dialog: --I can't feel my nuts, Woody. And Kelly still wants another kid. DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY head inside the motel office.
48) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are in their motel room. WOODY stands at the window, nervously looking outside.
48) 3) dialog: Woody, your headlight doesn't even work.
48) 5) dialog: Did you inhale exhaust fumes? Because something is happening to your brain. I think it might be retardation.
48) 7) dialog: Whatever, Corky. Doug shrugs Woody off and dials his cell phone.
48) 8) dialog: 
48) 11) dialog: 
48) 19) dialog: Yeah, I'm having a great time. No old Doug, yet, but I haven't gotten sun- burned... Woody looks at Bob.
48) 22) dialog: 
48) 25) dialog: 
48) 28) dialog: 
49) 0) text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY ride along the highway, as the sun burns the morning fog off of the wheat fields. Doug looks over to Woody and yells above the motorcycle engines.
49) 5) dialog: I can't believe you made us leave so early. You really wanted to see the sun rise?
49) 12) dialog: Come on, Woody. It looks like a neat town. And Dudley's got another bag of poop to throw away. Dudley nods. Woody grits his teeth as they enter the town. It's a quiet, one stop-light town - with an old fashioned main street and town square. We see a banner over the street advertising a block party that night. It's a postcard version of small town America.
51) 2) dialog: Wow. Lucas is a polite town.
52) 0) text: BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY enter, with their motorcycle boots thunking on the wood floor, announcing to the entire diner that there are bikers there.
52) 6) dialog: well, how could we pass through this town without stopping? Everything looks so perfect.
52) 9) dialog: Excuse me? MAGGIE runs up and guides her Dad away from the guys.
52) 12) dialog: Are there any booths open? All the people quickly jump out of their booths.
52) 22) dialog: You like the waitress, huh?
52) 25) dialog: Mmmm. I'll have what he's having. Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She slides it in front of Doug.
52) 26) dialog: No, uh... I'll take a new one. He can keep his.
52) 28) dialog: Hey, it's okay. Really.
52) 38) dialog: Hey, guys. This block party tonight looks cool. Music, grilled corn, dollar beers, funnel cakes.
52) 52) dialog: (sotto, to the guys) Not another one of these assholes. Murdock hears this and whips around to see the Wild Hogs.
52) 54) dialog: Oh, I was actually referring to some guys we met at a bar about two hundred miles east of here. You're probably not
52) 79) dialog: Us? Oh, no. We're from Cincinnati. Bud calls out to the kitchen.
52) 82) dialog: No. We're Wild Hogs. That's our gang.
52) 85) dialog: Weren't you just hiding in the kitchen?
52) 89) dialog: Well, now he is.
53) 0) text: CHARLEY walks through the town square with DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY. There's a stage and booths set up around the park in the center - ready for the block party. As the news spreads that the Wild Hogs are friendly, the townspeople start to take to the streets again.
53) 2) dialog: Well, Woody is the one who really--
53) 4) dialog: Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down the block and get more exercise.
54) 5) dialog: Wow. That's fantastic.
54) 8) dialog: Those guys are that big of a problem, huh?
54) 10) dialog: And the police don't do anything?
54) 22) dialog: 
54) 26) dialog: Sure. Let's do it.
54) 28) dialog: Okay. Of course you get a vote. Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly intend to stay.
54) 30) dialog: But you didn't plan the voting system. I did. So you only get one. Sorry. Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes.
56) 0) text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY exit out of an old fashioned hotel next to the diner. They cross to the town square, where the block party is in full swing. Townspeople mingle around eating corn-on-the-cob and hotdogs. Up on the stage, a plump, middle-aged man with a goatee and a polo shirt tucked into dockers - sings Justin Timberlake's "Rock Your body."
56) 3) dialog: These people love us. This is nuts.
56) 5) dialog: Well, let's not get too carried away with it. The truth is we're just regular guys. Let's not forget that.
56) 15) dialog: He's waiting for you to say something else, then he's going to kick you. Dudley gets a deflated look and backs off of Woody.
57) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at a picnic table, drinking beer out of plastic cups. They lean back and soak up the small town celebration around them. It's a great night.
57) 1) dialog: It doesn't get any better than this, huh? Bob notices Doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece of garlic bread.
57) 7) dialog: Thanks, Bob. You saved me from all that... buttery, garlicky flavor.
57) 11) dialog: I hope you choke on it. CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins - identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good.
57) 20) dialog: Well, it's nice to meet you guys. You've got a great town here.
57) 29) dialog: Or Thomas Milborn.
57) 36) dialog: Yeah. I think he really likes that girl.
57) 41) dialog: Ahh, just to escape for a bit.
57) 50) dialog: Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't sing Bon Jovi anymore.
57) 59) dialog: I don't think we need to. I mean, we can have our own test of manhood. Let's see how many ears of corn we can eat or something. I'll start. Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody just grins with that reckless look in his eyes.
58) 0) text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL approach a fence surrounding a pasture. Charley smiles.
58) 4) dialog: Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea, so... go ahead. Woody nods.
58) 6) dialog: You are?
58) 14) dialog: All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that bull. The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the fence, watching.
58) 26) dialog: Wheeeeew!! Yeah! Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into an angry charge towards Doug. The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to terror.
58) 27) dialog: Ahhhhhhhh! It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and starts lining up another charge at him.
58) 43) dialog: We just slapped the bull! The group high fives each other in congratulations, and starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing. ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley was holding open. The gate swings open. ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on.
59) 0) text: The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by himself at a picnic table, in post-Maggie bliss. DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the bull - but, carrying on happily.
59) 3) dialog: 
59) 6) dialog: Hey, Dud. You look happy.
59) 8) dialog: You have a sister?
59) 10) dialog: I thought you said the color ipod was your soulmate.
59) 16) dialog: Come on. Let's go back to the hotel. We've got to get up early to do some fishing. The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel.
59) 18) dialog: Open road, baby!
59) 20) dialog: Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going to have to talk to these guys again. Get them to leave this town alone--
60) 1) dialog: Woody!? What the hell is wrong with--
62) 0) text: Doug looks at Woody. He's starting to figure it out. Woody guiltily avoids Doug's glare and watches the Hells Angels through a vent in the port-o-potty.
64) 0) text: Upon hearing this, BOB, DUDLEY and DOUG all look at WOODY, who shrugs sheepishly. Bob is enraged.
67) 22) dialog: 
67) 26) dialog: Live!? We're going to die, Woody! You burned down their bar! We are dead men!
67) 30) dialog: Sorry? That's it!? You're sorry!?
67) 32) dialog: Why? It's just a stupid vacation!
67) 40) dialog: (realizing, to Woody) This trip is just you running from your life. Your miserable, screwed up life.
67) 47) dialog: It doesn't mean anything! It's just a patch my wife made!! Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment, they look over to the sidewalk and see: ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head back to their homes. Doug, Bob and Dudley lower their heads in disgrace. So much for being heroes.
68) 0) text: DOUG stands in the darkened police station with DUDLEY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL. CHARLEY looks out the window with DOUG.
68) 2) dialog: You think?
70) 3) dialog: Thanks, Charley. Charley and the Dooble brothers look a little surprised.
70) 5) dialog: 
70) 14) dialog: 
71) 0) text: Doug wakes up on a cot in an open jail cell. He walks out of the cell, and over to the window. ANGLE ON: The Main Street Diner: The Hells Angels bikes are still parked outside, and the bikers appear to be passed out in various booths, chairs, and the street out front. BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach the window.
71) 1) dialog: They're still out there. Passed out.
71) 3) dialog: Bob, we can't leave. They'll just stay here and keep terrorizing this town.
71) 5) dialog: For what? To be stationed here permanently? Because these guys will just come back when they're gone. And it'll be even worse.
71) 11) dialog: We've created this problem, Bob. We've got to think of a way to solve it.
71) 13) dialog: Tell her "no," Bob. Bob looks uncomfortable at this thought.
71) 15) dialog: Well, you're going to have to, Bob! We're not going to screw over an entire town because you're afraid of women! Bob stands up, insulted.
71) 18) dialog: You know, you can storm out too, if you want.
71) 20) dialog: Thanks, man. Doug smiles and gives Dudley a squeeze on the shoulder. Dudley is clearly disappointed, having assumed Doug would tell him to go see Maggie. Dudley just stands there, silent.
71) 21) dialog: You okay?
72) 0) text: Doug exits and looks around the corner of the building, making sure the Hells Angels are still sleeping, then starts walking towards a wooded park behind the town.
73) 0) text: Doug walks through the park, looking depressed. He passes through a small playground, and has a seat on a bench. He watches all the children play, and his eyes fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles together. They have cards in their spokes, making engine sounds as they ride around having a great time together. Doug smiles and watches them play together.
73) 3) dialog: Hey, Bud. Look, I'm sorry we got your town in all this trouble. This trip was supposed to fix problems, not cause them.
73) 5) dialog: What do you mean? Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing.
73) 11) dialog: You're right. That's why I stopped singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a risk. That was old Doug. And now it's gone. I've taken away all the risk.
73) 13) dialog: It's not. And I have a will, now. So, I only have so much livin' left. And somehow I've lost the best part of it.
73) 15) dialog: These are worms.
73) 17) dialog: I don't get it.
73) 19) dialog: What's that have to do with worms?
74) 0) text: Doug walks up to the shore and sees Woody, trying to push a canoe towards the water. Woody notices Doug.
74) 2) dialog: Hey. Going fishing?
74) 4) dialog: I've got worms.
74) 7) dialog: Um... Look, man. I'm sorry about Claudia. And the job.
74) 10) dialog: But, you shouldn't have lied to us--
74) 16) dialog: You would have stormed off right then, huh?
74) 20) dialog: Well, what's the point of being in a motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in a little trouble? Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit.
74) 21) dialog: It'll be okay, man. Woody smiles a little as well.
74) 23) dialog: Yeah. We won't die. I don't think.
74) 29) dialog: Well, the good thing is we'll be able to know for sure. That'll be cool.
74) 31) dialog: Did you bring the paddles?
74) 33) dialog: Why were you here?
74) 36) dialog: Hey, Bob. Worms? Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods.
74) 39) dialog: 
74) 46) dialog: Were those the only two paddles?
74) 49) dialog: Oh. Bob sits down on the grass.
74) 51) dialog: 
78) 0) text: DOUG, BOB, and WOODY are walking back from the lake, and pass by Maggie's house. BUD, standing on the porch, sees them and smiles.
78) 3) dialog: Well, we can change that. Bud laughs as the guys enter the house.
79) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at one of many card tables arranged in the family room, eating lunch. CHARLEY enters through the front door..
79) 20) dialog: He's with you, isn't he?
79) 26) dialog: 
79) 28) dialog: Dudley has mine. I'll just call him.
79) 30) dialog: He needed to call his answering machine so his cat could hear his voice.
79) 35) dialog: Yeah. And the girl wasn't even smiling - she just had a cleft lip.
81) 1) dialog: (knowingly, to group) Nope. The Hells Angels have him. Doug gives a look to the other guys. They mouth "Shit:"
83) 0) text: Doug shakes his head at Dudley's stupidity.
83) 1) dialog: 
85) 0) text: DOUG sits in a chair, deep in thought. BOB, WOODY, EARL, BUCK, and BUD stand with other members of the town. MAGGIE is on a couch, sobbing into her hands.
85) 3) dialog: No they aren't. We're going to get him back.
85) 15) dialog: No. Nobody is paying anything. Everyone stops and gives Doug a puzzled look. He has a new fire behind his eyes. His suburban quietude has transformed into something more... valiant.
85) 17) dialog: We're not calling the Highway patrol. We're not gathering ten thousand dollars. We're going over there and getting our friend back.
85) 19) dialog: It's not. But sometimes you have to do the things that aren't safe, to create a world that you're happy being in. These Hells Angels don't want our ten thousand dollars. They want our dignity. They want us to be afraid of them just like this town is. And once they know we're afraid, they can do whatever they want. That's how these guys exist. That's how they ride into this town and tear it to pieces... Because people want to keep their lives safe so badly, they give up the best part about it... Doug takes his Wild Hogs jacket and pulls it on.
85) 20) dialog: .The adventure. Doug looks at Woody and Bob. Woody smiles and pulls on his jacket.
86) 4) dialog: Where's Dudley? Jack turns back and nods at one of the Hells Angels. They push DUDLEY forward. We see he is now completely cocooned in duct-tape - like a mummy. There is only a small slit for his mouth and eyes.
86) 6) dialog: Just hold tight, Dudley.
86) 11) dialog: 
86) 14) dialog: We're not giving you any money. Jack looks surprised.
86) 16) dialog: We're not going to play your games. We're all adults, here. It's not highschool. I'm sorry your bar got burned down, and we'll be glad to help you get it rebuilt, but we're done being bullied by you. Now give us back Dudley, and get out of this town. The Hells Angels start to laugh. Jack turns back to them and smiles, "Can you believe these guys?" Doug is starting to lose his cool.
86) 17) dialog: (yells to Jack) Give us back our friend, asshole! The Hells Angels are suddenly silent. Jack turns back and looks at Doug in disbelief - then rage. Doug starts to look a little worried.
86) 19) dialog: (losing some confidence) Ass... hole.
86) 27) dialog: 
86) 32) dialog: Wait!! Wait a minute! The Hells Angels stop.
86) 33) dialog: 
86) 36) dialog: Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you win, we'll give you ten grand and go back home. You'll never see us again. But... If I win, you let Dudley go and you never set foot in Lucas again. This town is off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever.
86) 41) dialog: Well? You in, or are you too much of a bitch? The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage and turns back to Doug.
86) 43) dialog: Great. Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly fading away.
86) 44) dialog: 
87) 0) text: DOUG and JACK are standing "in their corners," opposite each other in the dirt parking lot. They're surrounded by a circle of Hells Angels, rowdily waiting for the fight to commence. WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his corner.
87) 2) dialog: All right. When do I hit back?
87) 11) dialog: 
87) 13) dialog: 
87) 15) dialog: Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt!
87) 17) dialog: Yes!-- But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony. Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty. Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug five yards into the dirt.
87) 19) dialog: Hah! Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his head.
87) 24) dialog: Damn. Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the Hells Angels.
87) 26) dialog: Ahhh! Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines up another punch.
87) 28) dialog: Wait! Wait-- Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.
87) 29) dialog: Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal abscess.
87) 31) dialog: look, I really hate you, but I don't want to feel responsible for a death. I'm a dentist. I took an oath. Same one as doctors. If the infection in that tooth gets to the root - it could seep into your nervous system. Just let me look-- Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't move.
87) 37) dialog: Yeah. One of the best. And I know when your gums are that swollen and your
87) 44) dialog: 
87) 53) dialog: 
87) 95) dialog: You still don't get it do you, Jack?
87) 97) dialog: We are the real bikers. As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes
88) 0) text: It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK.
88) 2) dialog: Ahh, we should be heading back. I think we've had enough excitement for one trip. Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand.
88) 10) dialog: (to Woody and Bob) You guys ready to head back?
88) 16) dialog: You are?
88) 19) dialog: Karen? / Kelly?
88) 24) dialog: Hey, baby. What are you doing here?
88) 42) dialog: I hadn't really decided. I have been having a good time, though.
88) 48) dialog: 
88) 51) dialog: You'll see him even more if you and Billy meet me in San Francisco. We've got a suite at the Ritz-Carlton. Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks concerned.
88) 53) dialog: Ahh. We can risk it. Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face and kisses her back... Then, turns to Woody and Bob.
88) 54) dialog: We ready?
89) 5) dialog: 
89) 10) dialog: Wante-ee--ed!
