10) 2) dialog: Yeah, hey, Mac. How's it go--
10) 8) dialog: Thanks, Mac. Open internet, okay? A pause.
10) 10) dialog: Mac. Open. Internet. A pause.
10) 12) dialog: Alright, Mac. I'll show you. Dudley clicks a few keys and nods satisfactorily.
10) 14) dialog: Right, because I just opened it.
10) 17) dialog: What? No! Dudley jumps forward and starts hitting the keys.
10) 19) dialog: I didn't want to search that! I said specs... "all the data to be compiled."
10) 21) dialog: Ahhh, No!!
10) 26) dialog: 
10) 28) dialog: Sorry.
20) 0) text: We see a garage crowded with disassembled Apple computers, printers, and a Harley Davidson Sportster. Out walks DUDLEY, who's biker outfit doesn't quite mesh with his thick-lensed eyeglasses. Dudley cockily pulls on a "Wild Hogs" jacket, kick starts the motorcycle, presses a button to open the garage door, and rides the motorcycle out. However, as he gets halfway out of the garage, the garage door catches on something, and snaps back down. It clotheslines Dudley off the bike, which rolls down the driveway and into some garbage cans. Dudley lays in the driveway, staring up at the sky with a pained look on his face.
21) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...
22) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all wearing "Wild Hogs" jackets. And on this, we:
23) 5) dialog: Thanks, Woody. I feel really safe with you.
23) 7) dialog: I was trying to keep my face out of the wind.
24) 31) dialog: 
24) 36) dialog: No, that's the 25th. Ten is aluminum.
24) 46) dialog: Noooo!!
24) 50) dialog: But, I boogie board in Daytona. Can't our creed be "Be cool and boogie board?"
24) 73) dialog: Cool! Born to be wild! Dudley grabs a shirt and starts to pull it over the t- shirt he already has on. Woody gives a look to Bob and Doug.
27) 0) text: DOUG is riding his Harley, which is loaded with gear (sleeping bag, spare gas tank, saddle bags). He approaches a freeway entrance ramp, where WOODY and DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes, next to an entrance ramp sign that reads: U.S. Highway 50. The guys all tap fists, then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear.
27) 3) dialog: I got a tat.
27) 5) dialog: I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat! Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath. On his bicep is a tattoo of the Macintosh Apple. The guys nod, trying to look impressed.
27) 7) dialog: Trademarked, I know. But what are they going to do? It's in my skin, bitch! Dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket, as Woody ties a bandana skull-cap on his head. The guys look at Woody.
27) 36) dialog: Yeeeeaaah! Freedom!! Dudley throws his cellphone, but instead of going into the storm drain, it goes flying into traffic and smashes against an oncoming pickup truck. We hear the truck screech to a stop after it passes them.
28) 0) text: MUSIC CUE: BLUE OYSTER CULT's "(DON'T FEAR) THE REAPER." The four guys ride along the highway, through the hills of Indiana, smiling and nodding to each other. It's the Easy Rider moment. The camera ROTATES AROUND and PULLS OVERHEAD. It's beautiful country and the guys are in heaven. Dudley wears a clunky helmet from the eighties, as well as World War II motorcycle goggles.
31) 8) dialog: This is poop. Don't eat it. Dudley sets the bag aside and has a seat by the fire.
31) 11) dialog: It's in a plastic bag. I can't put that in the earth. I'll find a trash bin tomorrow. The guys shake their heads and look back into the fire. After a moment, Doug smiles.
31) 16) dialog: Fine. I'll just hang it on a tree.
31) 39) dialog: I'm afraid of girls.
31) 41) dialog: Wow. Now I really don't want to talk to one.
31) 46) dialog: My life blows. I don't have a family. Or a wife. I have a cat that doesn't like me. She wouldn't even stick around if she knew how to use a can opener. The guys all look at Dudley.
31) 54) dialog: Nah, I don't like those places--
31) 56) dialog: I know. I just don't--
31) 58) dialog: Okay... Sorry. We'll go.
31) 79) dialog: We need more water.
31) 85) dialog: Oh. Dudley takes this in for a moment.
31) 86) dialog: Is anybody else thirsty? The guys just look at him.
32) 0) text: BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are all sleeping on Bob's air mattress, like four sardines. Doug opens his eyes to see a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress. It's a stern-looking highway patrolman.
32) 13) dialog: 
32) 16) dialog: Morning.
36) 0) text: DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up.
36) 7) dialog: I kept mine on because I didn't want everyone to see my crank.
36) 19) dialog: I will... Do what Doug does! Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at Woody. He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers.
37) 2) dialog: Me, too.
38) 0) text: The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing. We see their jackets say "Hells Angels." The bikers turn and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY.
38) 8) dialog: 
38) 15) dialog: We're all successful professionals in real life. But on Tuesday and Sunday afternoons... We're bikers! Dudley spins around and shows them the back of his jacket.
38) 17) dialog: Hell yeah, brother. Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack, who pulls it on his massive frame. He shows it to the gang, who laugh again. Dudley does, too.
38) 18) dialog: So who's '51 panhead is that? Sweet ride. Woody has a catalog so you can make it cool.
38) 23) dialog: 
38) 24) dialog: 
38) 27) dialog: Seriously? You're serious!?
38) 33) dialog: Doug, don't worry. Yeah, I'll have a cooler bike than you, but that doesn't mean I'll get all cocky.
38) 35) dialog: 
38) 36) dialog: Hey, I don't care what you say! I ride a panhead now! I'm better than you!
39) 0) text: Everyone is standing out front. Dudley starts to get on the classic motorcycle. Jack stops him.
39) 2) dialog: That? That's a piece of junk.
39) 10) dialog: Like an adopt a highway thing?
40) 0) text: We see DOUG, BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar, looking very glum. The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the rusty sidecar is now attached to Woody's bike. DUDLEY sits in it looking miserable and cold (having lost his jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt). The guys get a good distance away from the bar and Woody waves for them to stop. They do and Woody looks back to the bar.
40) 10) dialog: I go wherever you go.
40) 12) dialog: No, my sidecar's just attached to your bike. I'd prefer to turn back, but I could only roll so far...
40) 21) dialog: I'll wait here, too. You'll get better gas mileage. Dudley gets out and falls to the ground.
40) 22) dialog: Leg's asleep. Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar.
41) 0) text: Woody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods.
42) 0) text: WOODY pulls up on his bike, where DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are waiting.
42) 8) dialog: What?
42) 10) dialog: Oh my god, you're right.
48) 0) text: DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are in their motel room. WOODY stands at the window, nervously looking outside.
49) 0) text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY ride along the highway, as the sun burns the morning fog off of the wheat fields. Doug looks over to Woody and yells above the motorcycle engines.
52) 0) text: BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY enter, with their motorcycle boots thunking on the wood floor, announcing to the entire diner that there are bikers there.
52) 14) dialog: 
52) 20) dialog: 
52) 23) dialog: I wanted to say something funny to her, but I could only think of black jokes. Maggie, still very skittish, approaches the table.
52) 37) dialog: It's hard to be funny without being racist. Doug is looking at the town's local paper, and smiles.
52) 39) dialog: Funnel cakes!? Let's stay here tonight!
52) 42) dialog: 
52) 57) dialog: (loudly, to Doug) so he is one of those assholes, Doug.
53) 0) text: CHARLEY walks through the town square with DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY. There's a stage and booths set up around the park in the center - ready for the block party. As the news spreads that the Wild Hogs are friendly, the townspeople start to take to the streets again.
54) 14) dialog: Ech.
54) 25) dialog: Cool! Let's fish! Doug shrugs.
56) 0) text: DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY exit out of an old fashioned hotel next to the diner. They cross to the town square, where the block party is in full swing. Townspeople mingle around eating corn-on-the-cob and hotdogs. Up on the stage, a plump, middle-aged man with a goatee and a polo shirt tucked into dockers - sings Justin Timberlake's "Rock Your body."
56) 6) dialog: Yeah, the best thing is to keep a low profile. Don't cause any waves. Then if somebody pushes us too far, Boom! We go Billy Jack upside their heads!
56) 12) dialog: Nooo. I'm just minding my own business. I don't want to cause any trouble. Dudley turns to Woody and stares at him. Woody looks confused.
56) 16) dialog: 
56) 19) dialog: Yeah, well... He once bit me on the sack. Dudley walks off towards the beer tent. Woody looks to the other guys with a puzzled look.
56) 22) dialog: Um... I, uh---
56) 29) dialog: Nothing-- uh... Maggie notices the tattoo on Dudley's shoulder.
56) 31) dialog: I-- have a cookie jar made out of a 2e. For fig newtons.
56) 33) dialog: Yeah. They're like fried chicken at a-- No, that's not... Dammit! This is hard. Maggie smiles sweetly as Dudley fumbles.
57) 30) text: DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE. The middle aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of Usher's "Yeah." Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively for a moment, but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley, he starts getting into it. He starts spinning around at a rapid pace, then drops to his knees, slaps the ground and shakes his head to the music. Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler. Maggie grins - actually amused by Dudley's rhythmic passion.
59) 0) text: The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by himself at a picnic table, in post-Maggie bliss. DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the bull - but, carrying on happily.
59) 7) dialog: I danced with her. And she likes macs. You know what that means?
59) 9) dialog: I have a soulmate.
59) 15) dialog: I thought it was. But now, I realize that ipod was just a well-designed whore. The guys smile. It's been a good night for all of them.
64) 0) text: Upon hearing this, BOB, DUDLEY and DOUG all look at WOODY, who shrugs sheepishly. Bob is enraged.
66) 3) dialog: 
67) 27) dialog: Oh, man. I thought it was going to happen slowly. I thought I had time! Dudley sits on the fountain edge and starts to tear up.
68) 0) text: DOUG stands in the darkened police station with DUDLEY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL. CHARLEY looks out the window with DOUG.
70) 1) dialog: Crap. I was thinking of that for us.
71) 0) text: Doug wakes up on a cot in an open jail cell. He walks out of the cell, and over to the window. ANGLE ON: The Main Street Diner: The Hells Angels bikes are still parked outside, and the bikers appear to be passed out in various booths, chairs, and the street out front. BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach the window.
71) 17) dialog: You do? Doug shrugs weakly.
71) 19) dialog: No, no. I mean, I thought about going to see Maggie while those guys are asleep, but you need me right now.
71) 26) dialog: 
75) 0) text: A cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove, making something in a big pot, as a crowd of townspeople eat in the kitchen and dining room. MAGGIE and DUDLEY cross through the kitchen, and out to the front porch.
76) 2) dialog: Sorry those jerks are in your diner.
76) 8) dialog: It makes me sick. Thinking they're too good for pancakes.
76) 10) dialog: This has been the best vacation of my life. I met you. Maggie blushes.
76) 12) dialog: Maggie, I have to tell you something. I'm not really a cool biker or a cool... anything. I'm a computer programmer. A nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She watches me sleep and I don't know why. I think she's waiting for me to stop breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm not. Maggie takes this in. After a moment, she smiles and kisses Dudley.
76) 19) dialog: Oh, people will eat. Don't you worry, Maggie. People will eat.
77) 0) text: DUDLEY kicks open the front door. JACK and the other Hells Angels are inside, drinking and carrying on.
77) 1) dialog: Alright, let's end this! The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his lip in frustration.
77) 2) dialog: 
77) 5) dialog: I'm not here to face any music. I'm here to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd be smart to take.
77) 7) dialog: You leave the town of Lucas, and my friends alone, and I do something for you. Something you can't live without. Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop on the counter, and punches a few keys. He swivels it around to show the gang.
77) 12) dialog: See where that says "Domain for sale?" Guess what that means. Your gang doesn't have a website! Nothing! No way to tell people about your history, post photos, sell shirts... You guys are living in the complete dark ages! (laughs cockily, then) So they way I see it: I need a favor from you and you need a favor from me. Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a moment. He then picks the computer up and smashes it down on the ground. It breaks into a hundred pieces. Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through what's left of it. The Hells Angels stifle laughter. Dudley is starting to look a little nervous.
77) 15) dialog: Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out. Dudley starts for the door, but several Hells Angels move over and block his path. Dudley stops and collects himself for a moment - then breaks into a panicked sprint for the other exit. The Hells Angels quickly spring into action and tackle him to the ground.
77) 16) dialog: Sanctuary! Sanctuary!! The Hells Angels pull off him, confused.
77) 18) dialog: Sanctuary. You have to take me to a church and leave me alone. The Hells Angels look at each other and shrug.
77) 25) dialog: 
80) 0) text: Jack stands next to Dudley, who is duct-taped to a chair with so much tape that it looks like he's in a cocoon. Only his head is uncovered. Jack holds Dudley's cellphone.
82) 3) dialog: No, I actually feel pretty-- Jack kicks Dudley's chair with his foot. It tips over and lands on it's side - with Dudley in it. Dudley looks out at the floor, helpless.
82) 4) dialog: Ow!
82) 6) dialog: Crap.
82) 9) dialog: (yelling to phone) Don't bring the money, guys!
82) 15) dialog: I'm a computer programmer! I don't need my legs! Jack considers this and turns back to the phone.
82) 18) dialog: Dammit. (yelling to phone) Bring the money!
83) 0) text: Doug shakes his head at Dudley's stupidity.
84) 5) dialog: Hey can we call my cat, now? She needs to hear my voice.
84) 12) dialog: Crap.
86) 5) dialog: (muffled from tape) Hey, guyth. Doug shakes his head.
87) 56) dialog: Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Dudley charges Jack, but his limited mobility results not in a tackle, but in him leaning on Jack. After a moment, Jack takes a step back and Dudley falls to the ground.
87) 57) dialog: Ow. Jack cracks his knuckles and looks to OILCAN.
87) 84) dialog: Ow. Ow! Ow, ow. Ow. Ow!... After a painful minute, Dudley is untaped. Charley looks at Jack's jacket.
87) 98) dialog: as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap. up from the ground.
87) 99) dialog: Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I guess.
88) 56) dialog: Let's ride. They start their motorcycles. The engines roar to life.
