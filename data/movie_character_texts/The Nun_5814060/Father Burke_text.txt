0) 2) dialog: Romania, yes.
0) 4) dialog: No. No apology necessary. Cardinal Conroy is a man who doesn’t make mistakes. I’m sure he had his reasons for selecting you. I'll still need your help at the convent since access for anyone but nuns is extremely limited. How long will it take for you to get ready for travel? 11.
0) 6) dialog: Good. Collect your things. And Sister -- we'll need to wear civilian clothes while traveling. This is one time we don’t need to broadcast our faith... Sister Irene nods.

0) 12) dialog: Mr. Thierault? Frenchie isn’t so sure he wants to confirm this. He looks over at Sister Irene. Suddenly aware of her. To Burke --

0) 29) dialog: So then you can take us. Hold on Frenchie. His eyes. Dark and haunted. You just kn he’d rather do anything else than go back there.
1) 0) text: Frenchie leads them to a rusted bucket of a TRUCK. As he circles around, Father Burke puts their SUITCASES into it bed. And then -- The Truck drives off with them. Revealing Frenchie standing by a HORSE-DRAWN WAGON. Both wagon and horses have seen better days.
1) 5) dialog: Beginning. Eight letters. With a W. Shows Sister Irene.
1) 7) dialog: Dawning. Writes it in.
1) 9) dialog: You have a knack for this, Sister.
1) 11) dialog: It’s not the puzzles I like as much as I like the answers. I like the certainty of the answers. We don’t get much of that luxury in the lives we've been called for...
1) 13) dialog: Is it? (pause) How long have you been a novitiate?
1) 15) dialog: Three years. And you still haven't taken your Temporary Vows?

1) 29) dialog: “Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” Frenchie looks over at Sister Irene. Back to Burke.
2) 2) dialog: The Church reaches out to me when it needs an investigation into unusual phenomenon associated with Catholicism. Unofficially they call it ‘miracle hunting’...
2) 4) dialog: We are. But I confess that is only part of our investigation. We also have orders from the Vatican to determine if the grounds are still... Holy. And off her look -- Frenchie stops. Points through the trees:
2) 10) dialog: A result of the war?
2) 12) dialog: Spit?
2) 15) dialog: Did you try to contact someone inside when you found the nun?
2) 18) dialog: Did you mention your discovery to anyone in town?
2) 31) dialog: Here. In the walls. But before I get to those...
2) 36) dialog: I am Father Michael Burke. This is Sister Irene Petra. To whom do we have the pleasure of speaking to?
2) 38) dialog: Forgive our appearance. But as you know, Reverend Mother, clothes don’t make the Catholic. We are here on behalf of Rome to inquire about the recent death in your convent...
2) 42) dialog: Would you allow us a moment please? Frenchie nods. Throws a look to Sister Irene. Back at Bur and the Abbess. And then leaves. Okay, round two: Jab. Block. Jab. Uppercut. 24.
2) 44) dialog: Are you saying you weren't aware of the recent passing of the Nun?
2) 46) dialog: Rome is concerned about the safety and well-being of your cloister. I'd like to speak with the Sisters so I can offer my assurances to the Church...
2) 48) dialog: I'm afraid that won’t suffice. They’11l just send more and perhaps less diplomatic Church Officials.

Can’t shake feeling of being watched. Looks up at the Dark Windows. Is someone up there? Watching him? Grooco000000000000aaaan. He spins. Shotgun at the ready. Sister Irene and Father Burke exit the Abbey. Startled, Frenchie quickly lowers his aim.
3) 4) dialog: That was the Abbess. She is the second in command of the Abbey.
3) 7) dialog: We need to wait until morning to speak with the nuns...
3) 9) dialog: That isn’t necessary. There are accommodations for us in the chapel... Frenchie about to protest. But bites his tongue instead. 26. FATHER BURKE (CONT’D) When you found the body, Frenchie, what did you do? Leave it?
3) 11) dialog: Where did you move it to?

4) 11) dialog: You're not helping.
4) 14) dialog: Looks to be a key of some kind. He tugs at the KEY. But the Rosary it’s attached to is lo in Sister Victoria’s dead fingers. Pulls harder. Rosary SNAPS. Beads scatter. But the Key is free. He inspects it further. Sees an ENGRAVING in its bronze:
5) 0) text: Overgrown with Tombstones and Tall Grass. Next to a SMALL CHAPEL that looks as if it’s still standing by faith alon Father Burke and Sister Irene stand at Sister Victoria’s Fresh Grave. Frenchie stands nearby with a shovel. Heads bowed because --

7) 5) dialog: Transferals.
7) 7) dialog: Transferals. Thinks...
7) 9) dialog: Not enough letters.
7) 11) dialog: Perhaps. He continues to go over his puzzle. Sister Irene has something to say. You can tell by the wa she sneaks looks at Father Burke. Say it now? Or... now? What about... Now:
7) 13) dialog: I was a chaplain in the war, stationed in near Eus in the south of France. There was... an incident. A child with visions. My work with the boy drew the attention of the Church and because of that I was recruited to look into the more unusual matters involving the Church...
7) 15) dialog: How do you --
7) 17) dialog: That they were a miracle.
7) 19) dialog: And Bishop Form, he spoke to you about these visions?
7) 21) dialog: And did he consider possession? 33.
7) 23) dialog: Have you had any visions since?
7) 25) dialog: Yes. He stands. Takes his plate over to the sink. Exits out of Kitchen. Leaving Sister Irene all alone. With only more questions.
9) 0) text: A starless, moonless night. Feels like it’s near lifeless too. As Father Burke pauses by a crumbling tombstone. Where’d the boy go? Father Burke walks deeper into the cemetery. His eyes dar from grave to grave. Searching. The Boy could be anywhere Or maybe he’s gone entirely. Because he doesn’t seem to b anywhere. Damnit. Father Burke begins to turn back but -- The Boy. 35. There he is. Standing still in the darkness. His head hun And whoa, it looks like he’s SPROUTED WINGS from his back Who is this? Unnerved, Father Burke slowly approaches. Slow and deliberate. Doesn’t want to scare the boy away. As he draws closer, he realizes those wings. They’re ston Because the boy is standing in front of an ANGEL STATUE. Boy keeps his head down. His eyes off Burke. Father Burke uses this as an opportunity to get even closer when -- The Boy SNAPS HIS EYES up at Burke. Burke stops. Can’t believe it --

11) 14) dialog: I saw something too. It’s what drew me to the cemetery... A boy. Daniel...
11) 16) dialog: Unlike your case, after what I believed was careful evaluation, I made the judgment he was possessed and proceeded to act accordingly, within the laws of the Church. It was my first exorcism.
11) 18) dialog: The Church thought so. They believed the evil was cast out...
11) 20) dialog: Daniel sustained severe injuries during the exorcism. Ones from which he could not recover. He died days later. I often wonder if I was too eager with my determination. (pause) That is a puzzle. 42.
11) 22) dialog: Territory.
11) 24) dialog: Cardinal Conroy recommended you because you were familiar with the territory. He didn’t mean Romania. He meant your visions. You’re familiar with strange phenomenon... HOLD ON Sister Irene. If she wasn’t so pious she’d probab be screaming ‘oh fuck oh shit’ inside her head right now. Maybe she is anyway.

12) 6) dialog: It is a fortress, after all. Built to keep unwanted forces out. The question we have to answer, Sister, is has it been breached? Not to give anything away but... Yeah. It has.
14) 0) text: Candles lit. Feels like it’s always night time in here. The Chair sits empty. We hear FOOTSTEPS ECHO before we se Sister Irene and Father Burke enter the chamber. 45. Both quiet. Trying to listen for signs of life. But they hear none. Father Burke walks over to the DOORWAY blocked by the Portcullis. Beyond it, a Passageway draped in shadow. Through the Iron Grate --
14) 1) dialog: Hello? Abbess? As requested, we’re hear to speak with the Nuns... Listens. Still no answer. He looks back at Sister Irene: Any ideas? But then -- ClinkClinkClinkClinkClinkClinkClink! Of the Portcullis. Father Burke steps back. In the walls, they hear the rusted links of an Ancient Ch clinkclinkclink as it raises the Portcullis. Sister Irene walks over and joins Father Burke at the threshold of the

Runs her fingers along the engraving. R1:18. Wondering what it means... FATHER BURKE (CONT’D) I realized last night what it meant. Revelations 1:18: ‘I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of Hell and of death.’ Frankly, I’d rather not know that. Sister Irene I think agrees. As she gives another quick glance to the teeth above. Before she crosses steps into shadows of the Passageway. We follow. Through Narrow Darkness and into the Bright Light of a

Which one was it? Thump. That one. Father Burke walks over to the Tomb. He puts his ear up against its slab. Hears something moving inside. Father Burke looks around the Parlour. He sees an old FIR POKER leaning up against the Book Shelf. Grabs it and returns to the Tomb. Uses the Poke to pry op the Tomb, revealing -- A SHRIVELED, OLD CORPSE. Surrounded by coils and coils of WRITHING SNAKES. Holy shit... Horrified, Burke reels back. It’s as if the very walls of this castle are infested with these serpents. He watches a snake slither across the length of the parlo and disappear into a crack in the stone. 50. Father Burke quickly shuts the Tomb. Turns and looks back the Parlor: What is this place? And then, a flash of memo Prompts him into action. From his satchel, Father Burke pulls out one of the Ancie Texts found last night. Flips the pages and sees -- AN ILLUSTRATION. Of this Parlor. But with a symbol on the floor. Father Burke walks to the center of the room. Gets on his knees and inspects the floor. Smells it. Huh. Something t for sure. Dips his finger in it.

28) 5) dialog: That Abbey existed for hundreds of years without incident. Until very recently. You heard Gregoro -- something changed. If there is a portal and it’s been opened we need to close it...

31) 16) dialog: I fear something is very wrong here, Abbess... I don’t believe it began with the deceased Nun.
31) 18) dialog: That Nun -- I found her clutching something in her hands. A key. Pulls the Rosary Key out from his side pocket. Dangles it front of him. Like bait. 72. FATHER BURKE (CONT’D) Would you happen to know what it opens? I suspect it was important to her...

Don’t go any further. Startled, Father Burke steps back. Her fingers still clut his arm as he does and -- holy shit -- Her arm breaks off and comes with him. Father Burke drops the candle. It still glows. A miracle. He grabs her arm with his other hand. Her grip strong, he struggles to pry off her fingers. They look like the ends a dead tree branch. Gnarled, withered, spindly. Still stepping back, he frees himself and the arm drops. Shocked, he looks back up at the Abbess. Still seated in chair. One arm gone. Not that you can tell, really. And then -- The Abbess leaps out of her chair. Lunges at Father Burke. He falls back and The Abbess leaps on top of him. He struggles to fight her off as he hears her SHRIEK --
