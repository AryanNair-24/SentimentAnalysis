60) 3) dialog: [Let's see.  Okay.  An unfortunate fellow  was locked up in prison doing five to ten  for armed robbery.  All he could think of  the whole time was eating pussy.] Zoey looks up at them telling the joke.
60) 4) dialog: [The day finally came for his release.   He walked out of the prison with a new  suit and fifty francs the officials had  given him, and made a bee-line for the  whorehouse in the nearest town.  Slamming  his fifty francs on the front desk, he  said, "I wanna eat some pussy."] Jean is already laughing.
60) 5) dialog: [I'm not done.  Listen.  "Where've you  been," said the greasy fellow behind the  desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close  look these days."] Zoey glances at all of the people.  Then her eyes lock wi the concierge security guard.
60) 6) dialog: ["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict,  pulling him out of his chair by the shirt  collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I  want it now!"] The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.
60) 7) dialog: ["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor,  "I'll see what I can do."  So the ex-con  followed him through to the very back of  the warehouse through some stained,  tattered red curtains, and into a grimy  little room where a bedraggled looking  whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed.   "She's yours for fifty francs," said the  proprietor, and the fellow went at it.] Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg i ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it.  His fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it. Her eyes widen.
60) 8) dialog: [After a little while, he came across a  piece of egg.  "That's funny," he thought  to himself, "I don't think I had egg for  breakfast."  But he spat it out and kept  eating away.  Next he found a piece of  chipped beef wedged between his front  teeth.  "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped  beef this week," he thought, but kept on.   Then he came across the corn.  "What is  this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be  sick."] The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety.  Zoey kn he's going to make his move.
60) 9) dialog: ["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what  the last guy said."] Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard w out the .38 and fires three shots. Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest.  He falls to the  ground. The other hits Francois in the arm. In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the gro of people huddled on the floor. Everyone is screaming and trying to get away. Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guar killing him dead. Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into t of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan offic killing them all. People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into t ceiling.
