His shagg hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lov lad with a prize-winning smile. A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aid by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little ro appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky mot A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye an he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from h utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments stud the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repai Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few fe above the ground on a magnetic-field).

As the farmer carefully  inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker.
