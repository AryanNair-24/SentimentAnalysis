75) 16) dialog: These aren't trick questions, Private.  You'll be given an Article 15 and be  going into the ADCAP Program one way  or the other. What happens after  that is up to you. I'm just trying  to understand how somebody like you  thinks. Silence--

75) 36) dialog: Any serious problems with your  sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
75) 38) dialog: It works like this, Private--every  soldier in a war doesn't have to  believe in what he's fighting for.   Most of them fight just to back up  the soldiers in their squad--you try  not to get them killed, try not to  get them extra duty, try not to  embarrass yourself in front of them.
