0) 978) dialog: All right. We know they're together. We know they're within a certain radius of this spot. I'm declaring the case with the county right now. Until help arrives:
0) 981) dialog: I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one, and the kid with the curly hair to come with me in the station wagon. Randy, you drop-in and head up-river with the rest of your troop, then split-up on foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low.
