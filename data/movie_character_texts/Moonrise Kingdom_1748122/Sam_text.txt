0) 417) dialog: No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"
0) 427) dialog: I'll be leaving soon.
0) 430) dialog: What happened to your hand?
0) 435) dialog: 
0) 444) dialog: Sam. What's yours?
0) 480) dialog: Were you followed? 22.
0) 486) dialog: Good.
0) 489) dialog: Did you bring a cat?
0) 492) dialog: Can you read a map?
0) 496) dialog: I do cartography.
0) 499) dialog: I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes.
0) 504) dialog: (pointing on the map) Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred (which means four o'clock). How does that sound?
0) 508) dialog: You want some beef jerky?
0) 515) dialog: Let's go.
0) 520) dialog: Are you thirsty?
0) 524) dialog: Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly.
0) 527) dialog: Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It cools your head down.
0) 531) dialog: 
0) 535) dialog: Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing.
0) 540) dialog: Unknown. I guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks. 24.
0) 544) dialog: These might be poisonous.
0) 550) dialog: Not bad. Anyway, they're good for survival.
0) 555) dialog: I agree. Why do you say that?
0) 561) dialog: You smell like perfume.
0) 566) dialog: I brought water, too.
0) 570) dialog: Should we catch him?
0) 575) dialog: Trout bait. We need worms.
0) 581) dialog: You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe I've got a licorice whip.
0) 586) dialog: How strong of a swimmer are you?
0) 590) dialog: 
0) 605) dialog: Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you, if you put your fingers in their mouths. Let me see if I can catch this one.
0) 608) dialog: Somebody wrote on him.
0) 613) dialog: 
0) 617) dialog: Fish on hook!
0) 625) dialog: You're doing good.
0) 628) dialog: This is for fishing. 27.
0) 637) dialog: 
0) 641) dialog: Anyway, I used to be.
0) 644) dialog: We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs.
0) 650) dialog: What else did you bring? We should make an inventory.
0) 656) dialog: Go ahead. 28.
0) 673) dialog: That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter? 29.
0) 680) dialog: That's OK. We can share.
0) 683) dialog: These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue.
0) 687) dialog: Do you steal?
0) 690) dialog: Why? You're not poor.
0) 697) dialog: Are you depressed?
0) 700) dialog: How come? 30.
0) 711) dialog: Does that mean you?
0) 716) dialog: To me, it is.
0) 722) dialog: I'm sorry.
0) 727) dialog: I'm on your side. 31.
0) 733) dialog: Which one's the best?
0) 994) dialog: (angry at himself) Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. We're almost there.
0) 1000) dialog: What do you creeps want?
0) 1005) dialog: Why?
0) 1009) dialog: No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts. 42.
0) 1018) dialog: Listen to some reason: I don't like you. You don't like me. Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear?
0) 1037) dialog: Do not cross this stick.
0) 1051) dialog: It was him or us.
0) 1057) dialog: They got Snoopy through the neck.
0) 1065) dialog: No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue. 44.
0) 1072) dialog: Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it.
0) 1076) dialog: They're after us. We got to move.
0) 1080) dialog: 
0) 1087) dialog: I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never --
0) 1100) dialog: Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die.
0) 1230) dialog: I know!
0) 1233) dialog: On three!
0) 1242) dialog: Me, neither. 51.
0) 1247) dialog: Let's change it. What should it be?
0) 1256) dialog: I made you some jewelry.
0) 1259) dialog: Are your ears pierced?
0) 1273) dialog: 
0) 1278) dialog: 
0) 1291) dialog: Why do you always use binoculars?
0) 1296) dialog: 
0) 1300) dialog: What do you want to be? When you grow up. 53.
0) 1305) dialog: 
0) 1310) dialog: It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.
0) 1316) dialog: 
0) 1322) dialog: Some people frown on these problems.
0) 1328) dialog: It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but I don't give a damn.
0) 1334) dialog: I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one.
0) 1339) dialog: I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about.
0) 1381) dialog: I don't know.
0) 1389) dialog: Not to my recollection.
0) 1405) dialog: 
0) 1411) dialog: 
0) 1592) dialog: I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us. 64.
0) 1608) dialog: 
0) 1614) dialog: 
0) 1621) dialog: What happened?
0) 1625) dialog: Ah.
0) 1630) dialog: Thanks.
0) 1634) dialog: A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
0) 1747) dialog: Get out of my chimney.
0) 1751) dialog: 
0) 1756) dialog: It's worthless to me. There's no point. Not without Suzy.
0) 1760) dialog: How'd you get here?
0) 1764) dialog: 
0) 1782) dialog: Did you leave another note for Lionel?
0) 1787) dialog: That's true.
0) 1918) dialog: Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned.
0) 1930) dialog: Yes, sir.
0) 1935) dialog: Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the chapel tent?
0) 1940) dialog: I want to bring my wife.
0) 1977) dialog: I guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him --
0) 1982) dialog: What? Why? How?
0) 1988) dialog: I don't know what to say.
0) 2069) dialog: 
0) 2076) dialog: We can't. It's her magic power!
0) 2086) dialog: You killed your dog, by the way.
0) 2094) dialog: Why do you consider me your enemy?
0) 2099) dialog: She's my wife now.
0) 2103) dialog: I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand.
0) 2123) dialog: I'm OK.
0) 2128) dialog: 
0) 2130) dialog: Follow me!
0) 2514) dialog: How deep is it? I didn't bring my life jacket.
0) 2518) dialog: 
0) 2554) dialog: 
0) 2559) dialog: they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you, Suzy.
0) 2564) dialog: Let's jump.
0) 2682) dialog: See you tomorrow.
