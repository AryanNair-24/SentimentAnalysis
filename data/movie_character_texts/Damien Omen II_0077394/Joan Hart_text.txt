29) 0) text: Crop country, flat as far as the eye can see. A road straight as a knife cuts it in two, Small speck in the distance buzzes TOWARDS THE CAMERA -- Joan's car. Sudden wintery wind moans and whips the few trees into movement. The confident sound of the car's engine continues, then suddenly falters. The vehicle slows to a halt as the engine cuts out altogether, Wind drops as suddenly as it blew up, leaving an eerie silence. Car's ignition is | turned but fails to bring any life to the engine. Again and again the key is turned in frustration. INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 4g Joan stops trying to start the car. She's very agitated. The fuel gauge shows the tank to be half-full. She looks up the road ~- not a sign of life. She looks through the rear window. It's equally bleak. Near the car, however, she sees a billboard advertising a restaurant "3 miles" along the road, Nervous, she switches on the car radio, punching up the different stations in frustration. One catches her ear. A rabid preacher frightening the life ou of his listeners:

The billboard opposite again takes her attention. She get out of the car and leans across to the backseat for her coat. There's an abrupt fluttering sound followed by stra seratching on metal. She jumps back. There, by her face, a crow settles its enormous wings and eyes her from the ear roof. Joan gasps and moves instinctively away. The crow's nasty little eyes never leave her. She waves her coat ineffectually to frighten it away but the bird doesn move, Joan kicks the car door shut and moves off, watchin the crow as she pulls on her coat. Even with the gap wide ing between her and the car, she looks nervously back, Th crow just sits there, Twenty yards, Thirty. Forty. She takes a final look -- the crow has gone. Disquieted, she looks all around, The bird has disappeared, and with it g her anxieties. She settles down to cover the three miles without again looking back, CAMERA FOLLOWS her. ‘There's an awful screech and the crow descends from behind, It crash-lands on her head and WE SEE it lean forward, yello beak open. Joan lets out a piercing scream and flails at the bird with her arms, But the claws embedded in her hai won't be dislodged and the crow continues to pivot and pe at her face. Its beak is now saturated in blood. When the poor, demented woman finally turns, WE SEE her eyes are gone from the bloody sockets. ‘The crow's wings open wide and, like an avenged angel, it lifts off into the sk CAMERA RISES ABOVE the blinded woman reeling about the tarmac and finally slipping down the shoulder into a fiel Her screams and sobs float up unheeded.

She gets to her feet and tries vainly to find the highway, holding out her arms as if playing "Blindman's Buff." CAMERA ABOVE COLDLY WATCHES as she bumps into a tree beside the highway. She struggle up the embankment, clawing and calling out. She rushes ou from behind the tree as the lorry bears down. ‘There is nothing the Driver can do. He tries to brake. Screaming tires and a sickening thud heralds the demise of Joan Har Her body bounds into the air and lies still when it lands on the roof of the slithering truck. The silence would de absolute but for the idling of the lorry's engines and th caw of the crow, The big bird circles, then flies casuall away. 518 518 46
