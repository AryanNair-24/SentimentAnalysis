You have been no help to me on my job. You call at 3:00 in the morning on weekdays. Charming, charming. But you are of no assistance. I want you to know this was an experiment to see how selfish I could be. If I could really carry on, to snare a possible lover. If I was capable of defacing myself for the love of another. If I could stand not being wanted when I wanted to be wanted. And, I cannot so, with no further assistance and no guidance from you. I am ending this affair.
