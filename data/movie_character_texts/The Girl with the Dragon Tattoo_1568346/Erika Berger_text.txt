9) 4) dialog: Where you been? Erika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a mini-skirt.
9) 6) dialog: Smoking?
9) 8) dialog: TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety.
9) 10) dialog: Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated.
9) 12) dialog: I'm as much to blame for this as you.
9) 14) dialog: I read it.    I ran it.
9) 16) dialog: Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.
9) 22) dialog: Alone? He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'
9) 23) dialog: I already called Greger and told him I wouldn't be home tonight.
17) 0) text: Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika - in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather jacket. She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half- eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it.
17) 1) dialog: Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home.
17) 3) dialog: What are you doing?
17) 8) dialog: Saying -
17) 10) dialog: You're giving up.
17) 12) dialog: This makes me sick.
21) 3) text: Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister Annika and her Italian husband; Erika and her weirdly understanding artist husband Greger, whose arm is around her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers). GREGER
55) 0) text: Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks, comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to- go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies from his desk, books from his shelf. A second suitcase, presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.
55) 1) dialog: You can't be serious -
55) 3) dialog: We're in our worst crisis ever and you're writing a memoir?
55) 5) dialog: You fired you; I need you here, not the North Pole. You know what this is going to look like.
55) 11) dialog: There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone. He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue - and steps outside.
63) 0) text: Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.
86) 29) text: That's one reason. She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it. The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not unlike Blomkvist and Erika. MARTIN
110) 0) text: Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window. A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika. She lowers it a crack.
110) 1) dialog: Is it any warmer inside?
111) 0) text: As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going, using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk.
111) 2) dialog: The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers.
111) 4) dialog: Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat?
111) 9) dialog: I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top.
111) 11) dialog: Maybe in about an hour.      If you're interested. He is.
112) 0) text: Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her.
112) 2) dialog: We'll work through them.
112) 5) dialog: That sounds about right.
112) 12) text: I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. Erika nods politely. MARTIN
112) 13) text: So what do you say to taking on a partner? ERIKA
112) 20) text: (to Erika) I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason.
112) 21) dialog: And. VANGER
112) 26) text: Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it.
112) 30) text: Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger.
112) 32) dialog: Have you seen him try to make a fire?
113) 0) text: Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace.
113) 2) dialog: I haven't been. They asked me to come up yesterday.
113) 4) dialog: Why would I.   You live in the woods.
113) 6) dialog: I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could.
113) 11) dialog: You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three.
113) 13) dialog: We're not marrying into it.
113) 15) dialog: You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing. The logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up, comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears into the bedroom. He stares at the fire.
113) 16) dialog: Mikael?
113) 18) dialog: I'm leaving this God-forsaken island in the morning.
113) 20) dialog: So are you coming to bed or not.
115) 0) text: A news crew has crammed itself inside Erika's office, where a reporter interviews her -
115) 1) dialog: We made a serious mistake last year, and we regret it. But we're moving forward, and this is the first step.
115) 3) dialog: That's inaccurate. Read the original press release, Viggo. I didn't fire him. He's on sabbatical.
115) 5) dialog: I'm not sure, to be honest with you.
