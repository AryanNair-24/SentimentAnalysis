86) 14) text: It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business. LIV

86) 20) dialog: You don't?
86) 24) dialog: Harriet. Martin doesn't comment.    Just nods.    Silence.   Then
86) 28) text: We can talk about it now. (Blomkvist glances to Liv) Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me. LIV
