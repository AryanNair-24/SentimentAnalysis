34) 12) text: His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet.
70) 14) text: Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies. (points) Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother. It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point. BLOMKVIST
84) 0) text: Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like all writers, is out of shape, taxes him. A car driven by an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him.
85) 0) text: Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his dinner guests on the porch.
85) 6) dialog: No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in. Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand.
86) 0) text: The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern. Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.
86) 2) dialog: A dark day.
86) 4) dialog: She comes for the moose steak.
86) 6) dialog: Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something else?
86) 15) text: You're writing a book now, Martin said. BLOMKVIST
86) 17) text: I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New.
86) 23) dialog: What can't.
86) 27) text: Maybe we could talk about that later. MARTIN
86) 29) text: That's one reason. She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it. The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not unlike Blomkvist and Erika. MARTIN
86) 31) text: How so. MARTIN
86) 32) text: We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart. And Martin's, too, clearly.    Blomkvist dares to ask, as innocently as possible - BLOMKVIST
86) 33) text: You were here that day? MARTIN
86) 39) dialog: It was a terrible day. And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse. Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.
86) 40) dialog: This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book. Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will.
112) 0) text: Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her.
112) 4) dialog: How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so?
112) 8) dialog: We still own one. The Courier, here in town.
112) 12) text: I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. Erika nods politely. MARTIN
112) 14) text: We've never considered it before. We value our independence. MARTIN
116) 0) text: A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing Henrik and Martin. Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a cheerful yellow shirt. Birger unhappily looks on.
116) 1) dialog: Millennium is an excellent magazine. We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us.
