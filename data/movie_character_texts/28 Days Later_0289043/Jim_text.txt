4) 7) dialog: Ow...
7) 3) dialog: Hello?
12) 8) dialog: ...Hello?
12) 17) dialog: Father?
12) 20) dialog: Father, what are you...
12) 23) dialog: Jesus!
12) 26) dialog: Oh, that, was bad, that was bad... I shouldn't have done that...
14) 3) dialog: Shit.
17) 3) dialog: 
20) 17) dialog: I'm a bicycle courier. I was riding a package from Farringdon to Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut across me... and then I wake up in hospital, today... I wake up and I'm hallucinating, or...
20) 21) dialog: Jim.
20) 31) dialog: Where are your families?
20) 37) dialog: No... No! I'm going to find them. They live in Greenwich. I can walk. (heading for the exit) I'm going to... to go and...
20) 41) dialog: (pulling at the grill) Yes! I'll go and come back.
22) 3) dialog: 
23) 5) dialog: I understand.
23) 9) dialog: I understand.
27) 5) dialog: I'm not grateful.
27) 19) dialog: My old room was at the end of the landing. You two take it. I'll sleep down here.
30) 10) dialog: (draining the carton, and giving it a shake) It's empty.
30) 26) dialog: 
30) 34) dialog: It's Mr. Bridges...
30) 40) dialog: He lives four doors down...
30) 43) dialog: That's his daughter...
30) 48) dialog: No... No! I wasn't!
30) 52) dialog: No!
30) 76) dialog: (fazed, frightened of her) I... I don't know. I think so.
32) 3) dialog: 
32) 7) dialog: 
32) 13) dialog: The blood was everywhere. On me, on you, and...
32) 20) dialog: How long had you known him?
33) 6) dialog: Let's hope we don't have to get out of here in a hurry.
34) 6) dialog: (completely out of breath) No. You?
34) 11) dialog: I do need a break, by the way.
34) 16) dialog: Nothing.
34) 19) dialog: I've got a headache.
34) 23) dialog: Pretty bad.
34) 27) dialog: Because I didn't think you'd give a shit.
34) 39) dialog: 
34) 45) dialog: Jesus!
36) 7) dialog: (out of breath, barely able to speak) I can't.
40) 9) dialog: I'm Jim.
40) 40) dialog: This is your place, then.
40) 43) dialog: It's nice.
42) 10) dialog: There aren't any others in the building?
43) 7) dialog: Yes. Fine.
43) 14) dialog: It's fine. 32.
43) 19) dialog: I'll take the living room.
43) 23) dialog: Good night, Frank.
44) 5) dialog: Very shredded.
44) 10) dialog: So what do you make of them?
44) 14) dialog: ...I think they're good people.
44) 18) dialog: Yeah. 33.
44) 23) dialog: Right. Because if they slowed you down...
44) 27) dialog: In a heartbeat.
44) 31) dialog: I wouldn't.
44) 38) dialog: Selena - you think I don't get it. But I do get it. And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you.
44) 43) dialog: No, look - I mean thank you.
44) 48) dialog: Good night.
46) 6) dialog: Morning.
47) 5) dialog: (looking at the pans) They're all empty...
47) 17) dialog: Right.
48) 22) dialog: It's a recording?
48) 28) dialog: The North...
48) 50) dialog: Maybe they've got a cure.
48) 68) dialog: Get there how?
52) 7) dialog: Then we should go the indirect route. The one in broad daylight. That isn't underground.
53) 3) dialog: I knew this was a shit idea. You know why? Because it was really obviously a shit idea. Driving into a dark tunnel, full of smashed cars and broken glass is really fucking obviously a shit idea.
53) 7) dialog: Oh no.
55) 12) dialog: The world's worst place to get a flat.
56) 11) dialog: ...You heard that?
56) 17) dialog: Holy shit.
56) 43) dialog: (at the Infected) Fuck you!
60) 6) dialog: You're getting out?
60) 15) dialog: Wait! 43.
63) 15) dialog: It's okay. I think you can eat this stuff raw.
63) 42) dialog: It isn't any crap. It's whisky. It might be good to have.
67) 2) dialog: Jesus Christ. We're never going to be able to get out of London.
73) 5) dialog: ...What?
76) 10) dialog: We don't have any cheeseburgers.
78) 9) dialog: No.
85) 3) dialog: Who's unbelievably hungry?
85) 8) dialog: Let's have a picnic.
86) 8) dialog: (cracking a bun in half) These are great. They're like huge biscuits.
86) 13) dialog: 
86) 20) dialog: 
89) 3) dialog: You know what I was thinking?
89) 9) dialog: That's what you were thinking.
89) 13) dialog: About what? 53.
89) 22) dialog: 
89) 27) dialog: Uh-huh. You stole my thought.
89) 32) dialog: (slightly surprised, but
91) 6) dialog: Nor can I. It doesn't feel safe, outdoors like this.
91) 13) dialog: I know. I noticed that too. (reaching over and shaking
91) 19) dialog: How did you manage to get to sleep?
91) 29) dialog: (inspecting the bottle) Valium. Great. Not only will it get us to sleep, but if we get attacked during the night, we won't even care. (pops the lid) Two each?
91) 33) dialog: 
91) 57) dialog: Fuck you! 56.
92) 6) dialog: (confused, semi-conscious) What...
92) 12) dialog: (mumbled, half-asleep
93) 3) dialog: Here you go, Frank. This is how you catch dew. I'm covered in the fucking stuff.
95) 3) dialog: Bloody hell...
95) 7) dialog: But, the whole of Manchester. The whole city...
97) 3) dialog: It can't be...
102) 2) dialog: Try the horn.
104) 4) dialog: It looks deserted.
105) 8) dialog: They didn't all leave.
112) 6) dialog: Yes.
112) 10) dialog: We were hoping for...
112) 14) dialog: I didn't know what to imagine, so... We just feel lucky to have found you.
116) 12) dialog: You're keeping him alive?
116) 16) dialog: And has he?
118) 3) dialog: ...So how is she?
118) 9) dialog: Hey, don't...do that. Look, Hannah... Hannah's what Frank said she was. Tough. Strong. And just like me, just like you, she will cope...
121) 31) dialog: 
122) 6) dialog: Look. We're grateful. Very grateful for your protection, and just to have found other people. But if we're going to stay here with you, you're going to have to stop your men from -
122) 10) dialog: 
122) 18) dialog: A boy. I killed a boy.
122) 22) dialog: Yes.
122) 27) dialog: What?
123) 3) dialog: Get up. Get up!
123) 8) dialog: We've got to get out of here!
123) 12) dialog: (hauling them up) We're leaving. Now! NOW!
125) 19) dialog: ... Quarantine?
156) 4) dialog: Hannah! Selena!
163) 17) dialog: That was longer than a heartbeat.
163) 27) dialog: Listen to me. I've got to tell you - I've got to tell you. The world isn't fucked. It's going to be okay. We've got a chance, if we can get to...
163) 33) dialog: Ow!
163) 44) dialog: (holding the back of his
169) 8) dialog: Just fucking do it! 100.
171) 7) dialog: Jesus. Not the curtains too.
173) 5) dialog: You looked all right in this, you know.
176) 18) dialog: Do you think he saw us this time?
