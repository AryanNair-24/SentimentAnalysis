40) 14) dialog: Jim and Selena. Good to meet you. And this is my daughter, Hannah. (turning to Hannah) ...Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
40) 17) dialog: So... so this is great. Just great. It calls for a celebration. 29.
40) 25) dialog: Yes, her creme de menthe. Great. Look, sit, please. Get comfortable. Sit tight while I get it.
40) 48) dialog: There! I know it isn't much but... well, cheers!
42) 3) dialog: Normally we keep the windows covered at night, because the light attracts them. But when we saw your petrol station fire, we knew it had to be survivors... So we hooked up the Christmas tree lights. Like a beacon.
42) 8) dialog: Well, we're grateful you came. I was starting to really worry. Like I say, we haven't seen any sign of anyone normal for a while now.
42) 16) dialog: We haven't left the block for more than two weeks. Stayed right here. Only sensible thing to do. Everyone who went out... 31.
42) 21) dialog: And there's two hundred flats here. Most of them have a few cans of food, or cereal, or something.
42) 25) dialog: It isn't bad.
42) 28) dialog: We've got by, haven't we?
43) 12) dialog: Have to empty it each morning. We just chuck it over the balcony... No mod cons here.
43) 17) dialog: ...Well, look, it's pretty late. I'm going to turn in. We've got a spare room. Are you and Selena...?
43) 21) dialog: Oh, right. I mean, yes... So, good night then, anyway.
46) 4) dialog: Morning, Jim.
46) 8) dialog: Listen, have you got a minute?
47) 3) dialog: We lost water pressure three weeks ago. For a while, I thought we'd be okay with the water in the other flats. The cistern and tanks. But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe. You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant...
47) 7) dialog: It hasn't rained in over a week.
47) 11) dialog: You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation. Trap it somehow. I saw it on TV once and I've been experimenting, but I can't get it to work, and... you don't happen to...
47) 14) dialog: You'd never think it. Needing rain so badly... Not in fucking England... (he breaks off) Jim, we don't have enough water for and Selena.
47) 19) dialog: No. It's not what you think.
48) 5) dialog: 
48) 16) dialog: There's more. Listen.
48) 20) dialog: Then it just repeats.
48) 25) dialog: It's a recording. But this is where it's telling us to go.
48) 30) dialog: The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there.
48) 35) dialog: Sound carries in this flat. Jerry- built, I suppose, and... me and Hannah do need you more than you need us.
48) 39) dialog: It's okay. Look, it's the truth. I can't leave the block if it's just the two of us. 37.
48) 46) dialog: Yes. It's possible.
48) 54) dialog: The only way to find out is to reach them.
50) 3) dialog: Just so as you know. I don't take cheques or credit cards.
52) 3) dialog: What do you think?
52) 9) dialog: Let's just get it done. 39.
55) 3) dialog: 
55) 8) dialog: Fuck.
55) 14) dialog: Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.
56) 3) dialog: You know what to do.
56) 13) dialog: (from the front of the
56) 20) dialog: (as the rats rush around
56) 28) dialog: Hannah, get out, get out! (to Jim and Selena) Just lift it! LIFT IT!
56) 38) dialog: 
57) 4) dialog: Honey, you're a cab driver's daughter.
63) 22) dialog: Mmm. Irradiated.
63) 40) dialog: Put that back. We can't just take any crap.
63) 44) dialog: Who's arguing about whisky? I'm saying, don't get a cheap blend.
63) 47) dialog: Single malt. Eighteen-year-old. Dark, full flavor.
63) 51) dialog: Warm, but not aggressive. Peaty after taste.
67) 4) dialog: Don't you worry about that. I've sat twenty years in this seat. I've got my routes.
71) 6) dialog: Okay. We either do this now, or we're walking. 47.
72) 3) dialog: If anything goes wrong, you just drive. You put your foot down. And go as far as you can.
72) 6) dialog: You hear me, Hannah?
78) 12) dialog: Okay. We're done.
80) 6) dialog: You're Ayrton Senna's bloody daughter. 50.
86) 24) dialog: Hey.
86) 27) dialog: Look over there. 52.
86) 33) dialog: No. I think they're doing just fine.
90) 3) dialog: 
91) 8) dialog: I think we're safe enough.
91) 22) dialog: Bloody hell. You must have needed a hell of a prescription for that lot.
91) 31) dialog: Not for me, thanks.
91) 38) dialog: 
91) 43) dialog: All right, all right. Give her half of one.
92) 2) dialog: 
92) 9) dialog: Shh. You're having a bad dream, that's all.
93) 5) dialog: (packing the spare away) Okay. Let's get rolling. (he checks his watch) If we make good time, we'll be there before midday.
95) 5) dialog: It must be Manchester.
97) 7) dialog: (hitting the windscreen
100) 4) dialog: Okay, everyone. I think this is it.
104) 2) dialog: What do you think?
104) 9) dialog: Let's check it out. 60.
105) 14) dialog: 
106) 3) dialog: Nothing. Nothing here. I can't believe it.
106) 8) dialog: "We should go."
106) 12) dialog: 
107) 9) dialog: (under his breath) Get out it.
107) 23) dialog: I... I'm fine, honey. I'm sorry. I just lost my temper. I...
107) 29) dialog: Hannah...
107) 32) dialog: 
107) 37) dialog: Get away from me!
