20) 11) dialog: Who are you? You've come from a hospital.
20) 15) dialog: He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
20) 27) dialog: It began as rioting. And right from the beginning, you knew something bad was going on because the rioters were killing people. And then it wasn't on the TV anymore. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. We all guessed it was a virus. An infection. You didn't need a doctor to tell you that. It was the blood. 13.
20) 35) dialog: Yours will be dead too.
20) 39) dialog: You'll go and come back.
23) 3) dialog: If there's anyone in there who isn't human...
23) 7) dialog: Anyone.
27) 3) dialog: They died peacefully. You should be grateful.
27) 16) dialog: We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight.
27) 21) dialog: We'll sleep in the same room. It's safer. 18.
30) 38) dialog: Were you bitten?
30) 45) dialog: Were you bitten?
30) 50) dialog: Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
30) 54) dialog: Mark?
30) 71) dialog: Get that cleaned off.
30) 74) dialog: Do you have any clothes here?
30) 78) dialog: Then get them. And get dressed. We have to leave, now.
30) 81) dialog: More infected will be coming. They always do.
32) 11) dialog: The blood.
32) 15) dialog: 
32) 22) dialog: Five days. Or six. Does it matter?
32) 25) dialog: He was full of plans. Long-distance weapons, so they don't get close. A newsagent's with a metal grill, so you can sleep. Petrol bombs, so the blood doesn't splash.
32) 28) dialog: Got a plan yet, Jim? You want us to find a cure and save the world? Or fall in love and fuck?
32) 31) dialog: Plans are pointless. Staying alive is as good as it gets.
32) 37) dialog: Shhh.
34) 4) dialog: Need a break?
34) 8) dialog: No.
34) 14) dialog: What's up?
34) 21) dialog: Bad?
34) 25) dialog: Why didn't you say something before?
34) 30) dialog: (going through the bag) You've got no fat on you, and all you've had to eat is sugar. So you're crashing. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot we can do about that... 25.
34) 34) dialog: ...except pump you full painkillers, and give you more sugar to eat.
34) 37) dialog: As for the sugar: Lilt or Tango?
34) 42) dialog: Actually, I did have a can of Sprite, but...
34) 47) dialog: Quiet.
34) 51) dialog: That's an infected.
34) 54) dialog: They're in.
36) 5) dialog: Come on!
38) 7) dialog: Let us in!
40) 11) dialog: Selena.
40) 28) dialog: Shall we?
42) 6) dialog: We're grateful.
42) 13) dialog: And you haven't seen any people outside?
42) 19) dialog: Didn't come back.
42) 23) dialog: It's a good set-up.
44) 3) dialog: Very spruce.
44) 7) dialog: Uh-huh.
44) 12) dialog: They're desperate. Probably need us more than we need them.
44) 16) dialog: Good people?
44) 21) dialog: Well, that's nice. But you should be more concerned about whether they're going to slow you down.
44) 25) dialog: I'd leave them behind.
44) 29) dialog: Yeah.
44) 33) dialog: Then you're going to wind up getting yourself killed.
44) 36) dialog: I'm going to get some sleep.
44) 41) dialog: Sure.
44) 45) dialog: And I mean sure. Good night, Jim.
48) 3) dialog: There haven't been any broadcasts for weeks.
48) 13) dialog: 
48) 32) dialog: We.
48) 37) dialog: I wasn't -
48) 44) dialog: If it's a recording, for all we know the soldiers who made it are dead.
48) 48) dialog: And that stuff about the answer to infection. There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.
48) 52) dialog: Maybe they've got nothing at all.
48) 56) dialog: We could die trying.
52) 5) dialog: It's the most direct route to the other side of the river.
56) 24) dialog: They're running from the infected.
56) 32) dialog: (straining with the
59) 3) dialog: Whoa! Stop the cab! Stop the cab!
60) 3) dialog: Un. Believable.
60) 8) dialog: This place hasn't been looted. It's a gold mine.
60) 12) dialog: Food and drink is what's in there. And we need it.
60) 18) dialog: I've been living off Mars Bars and Coke for two weeks. I need some tinned fruit.
62) 4) dialog: Let's shop.
63) 6) dialog: I'll have you, you, you, you...
63) 12) dialog: Don't take anything we need to cook.
63) 27) dialog: Ugh. If I never see chocolate again, it'll be too soon.
63) 30) dialog: Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange, of course.
63) 35) dialog: Or Yorkies, obviously.
65) 3) dialog: We could have a problem here.
73) 3) dialog: Stay close, Jim.
73) 7) dialog: You heard.
76) 5) dialog: Where are you going?
76) 8) dialog: We've got enough food.
78) 4) dialog: Find anything.
78) 7) dialog: Find anything, Jim?
86) 6) dialog: Oh my God, yes. I can taste the vitamin C. I can feel it in my blood.
89) 6) dialog: You were thinking that you'll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You'll never read a book that isn't already written. Or see a film that isn't already shot.
89) 11) dialog: No... I was thinking I was wrong.
89) 17) dialog: All the death, all the shit - it doesn't really mean anything for Frank and Hannah. Because she's got her dad, and he's got his daughter, so... it's okay.
89) 20) dialog: (looking back at Jim) I was wrong when I told you that staying alive is as good as it gets.
89) 25) dialog: ...Was it?
89) 30) dialog: (smiling back at Jim) Sorry.
91) 16) dialog: 
91) 24) dialog: 
95) 9) dialog: No fire crews to put it out.
102) 4) dialog: Don't. We might attract the wrong kind of attention.
104) 6) dialog: Or overrun.
105) 12) dialog: I don't like this. I think we should go.
106) 5) dialog: Frank. 61.
106) 10) dialog: Yes.
107) 49) dialog: Jim... (breaking into a run) Jim, he's infected!
107) 54) dialog: (holding Hannah back) Jim!
107) 61) dialog: Jim!
107) 64) dialog: 
107) 84) dialog: 
118) 5) dialog: She's lost her dad. That's how she is.
118) 11) dialog: Shut up, Jim. Just shut up. I don't want her to fucking cope. I want her to be okay. And when Hannah had her dad, it was all okay. Remember? And when it was okay for them, it was okay for us. And now it's all fucked. 69.
119) 47) dialog: 
121) 18) dialog: Fuck you!
123) 5) dialog: Wha... 77.
123) 10) dialog: But we...
131) 4) dialog: You can't do this to her! She's only fourteen!
132) 13) dialog: You need to give me a moment with Hannah. Alone.
132) 18) dialog: He wants us to dress up nice.
132) 21) dialog: But if you want us to change, you'll have to get out of the room.
132) 24) dialog: (calm, powerful) It's just fucking polite.
132) 32) dialog: Eat them.
132) 35) dialog: 
132) 44) dialog: No. I'm making you not care.
132) 56) dialog: Jim.
144) 36) dialog: 
144) 57) dialog: Hannah! Hannah! We have to get out of here!
145) 3) dialog: Oh Jesus, Jesus, Hannah, stay with it, stay with it.
149) 12) dialog: Hannah! 92.
160) 4) dialog: Hannah!
163) 19) dialog: ...Jim?
163) 23) dialog: I thought...I thought you were...
163) 36) dialog: Hannah! Stop! It's okay! 98.
163) 40) dialog: He's not infected!
163) 48) dialog: It's a long story.
163) 51) dialog: We have to get out of here.
164) 9) dialog: Jim!
169) 3) dialog: We're going to crash!
169) 6) dialog: We're going to crash!
