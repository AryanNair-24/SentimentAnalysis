1) 9) dialog: Well, I'm full. You were right, hon. I shouldn't have eaten all that bread.
1) 13) dialog: You okay, babe? You seem out of it.
1) 17) dialog: Me too. Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three...
1) 18) dialog: I want a divorce. Creme Brulee.
7) 27) dialog: Please stop.
7) 31) dialog: If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car.
7) 39) dialog: Okay.
8) 6) dialog: I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it.
8) 11) dialog: Okay.
9) 42) dialog: Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a divorce so I jumped out of the car. Hope the kids behaved. Come on, I'll drive you home.
9) 47) dialog: Oh. I didn't know you were here. 
9) 51) dialog: Yes.
9) 57) dialog: A moving car, yes.
9) 61) dialog: 
9) 66) dialog: Thanks.
10) 7) dialog: We'll talk to the kids tomorrow. Tell them we're separating. Just separating. We'll do it together.
10) 10) dialog: I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch, she's gonna be crushed. But not right now. She's got enough to worry about...
10) 13) dialog: 
10) 20) dialog: David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ!
10) 24) dialog: Sorry about that.
10) 40) dialog: 
10) 45) dialog: That's my girl.
10) 48) dialog: Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening.
10) 51) dialog: You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford. 
11) 7) dialog: Yes. Just... yes.
11) 10) dialog: Guess what?
11) 14) dialog: My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.
11) 18) dialog: That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore.
11) 21) dialog: I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz. (to no one)  She screws him. 
11) 29) dialog: 
13) 3) dialog: I guess the price is right. 
13) 8) dialog: I'll take it. 
13) 13) dialog: I guess. 
14) 11) dialog: Who told you Tracy and I were  getting a divorce? 
14) 16) dialog: I have to go buy furniture now. 
15) 5) dialog: My wife is sleeping with David  Jacobowitz. I need a couch. 
15) 9) dialog: Sure. 
15) 14) dialog: I want it in beige. 
16) 5) dialog: Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for  a friend. 
16) 9) dialog: 
17) 2) dialog: Can't help but notice that you're  always surrounded by women.  Multiple women. 
17) 5) dialog: I'm getting divorced. Or, in the  process. Gonna be single again. 
17) 8) dialog: Any advice? 
17) 19) dialog: 
18) 5) dialog: Don't worry about it, here, sit,  I've been guarding this stool with  my life. 
18) 8) dialog: It's good to see you, man. I've  called you a few times. It's been  a rough couple of days, obviously.  Nothing I could use more than my  old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey,  we should play racquetball, when's  the last time we played  racquetball? 
18) 13) dialog: I'm sorry, what? 
18) 22) dialog: Are you breaking up with me? 
18) 28) dialog: Do you have anything with a worm  in it? Because I'd like a gallon  of that now. 
18) 40) dialog: This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things.
18) 50) dialog: 
18) 51) dialog: 
18) 55) dialog: I already have a drink.
18) 59) dialog: Okay.
18) 62) dialog: My wife is cheating on me with --
18) 67) dialog: You know what, I don't need this
18) 72) dialog: Okay.
18) 99) dialog: Yeah, okay.
18) 103) dialog: I'm sorry, what?
19) 25) dialog: I'll be fine. 
19) 29) dialog: It was two times -- 
19) 33) dialog: I did that on purpose. 
19) 38) dialog: Once I'm settled, I'll get the  kids so they can see the place. 
19) 45) dialog: 
19) 51) dialog: You have to fertilize once a  month. Not twice a month, not  once every two months. 
19) 56) dialog: The sprinklers turn off behind  you. 
19) 60) dialog: If it rains a lot, you need to  shut off the automatic setting. 
19) 69) dialog: I think it was when you screwed  David Jacobowitz. 
19) 72) dialog: Make sure my azaleas get enough  sun. 
20) 3) dialog: Okay, well, this is it. What do you think? Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but...
20) 6) dialog: There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want! Anytime!
20) 11) dialog: Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll visit all the time. Every weekend. It won't be that bad.
20) 16) dialog: Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned.
20) 21) dialog: But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron--
20) 32) dialog: You?
20) 37) dialog: Yeah. Why not?
20) 43) dialog: Is that so? You in love, buddy?
20) 52) dialog: Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for
20) 58) dialog: (back to Robbie) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking --
20) 62) dialog: Huh?
20) 67) dialog: Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you.
20) 72) dialog: I know, buddy.
20) 75) dialog: My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it?
20) 78) dialog: Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy? 
20) 83) dialog: I'm, uh... I decided to take a class.
20) 93) dialog: Okay, well... Molly, last chance!? 
20) 96) dialog: That's my angel. Back in a few. 
20) 100) dialog: Nope.
21) 3) dialog: What am I doing?
22) 6) dialog: What the hell am I doing?
24) 5) dialog: No thanks. So what exactly are
24) 10) dialog: I dunno. Five hundred?
24) 14) dialog: Okay.
24) 27) dialog: What the hell!?
24) 31) dialog: Those were my favorite shoes.
24) 38) dialog: No.
24) 42) dialog: What?
24) 48) dialog: No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
25) 3) dialog: I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea.
25) 8) dialog: Ha! I think I read that in GQ.
25) 12) dialog: Really?
25) 20) dialog: I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ?
25) 42) dialog: These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap?
26) 3) dialog: I'm sorry! Don't leave! 
26) 10) dialog: What's wrong with the Gap?
26) 32) dialog: I'm very warm.
26) 42) dialog: What does it do?
26) 49) dialog: Oh my God, it does.
26) 54) dialog: I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top.
26) 58) dialog: Eww.
26) 64) dialog: 
27) 38) dialog: Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
27) 43) dialog: 
27) 48) dialog: Tiffany! (then, realizing) You would!?
27) 54) dialog: Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me.
27) 62) dialog: Yeah, okay, that was meaner.
28) 4) dialog: I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right?
28) 9) dialog: We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are --
28) 13) dialog: Sexually?
28) 17) dialog: In my entire life?
28) 25) dialog: One.
28) 30) dialog: What? I married young. We met in high school.
28) 33) dialog: Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it.
28) 38) dialog: (a bit emotional) I miss my wife.
28) 54) dialog: 
28) 55) dialog: 
28) 61) dialog: 
28) 96) dialog: 
34) 8) dialog: 
35) 0) text: Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.
35) 7) dialog: For what?
35) 13) dialog: Oh, no. No, I'm not.
35) 17) dialog: Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball.
35) 21) dialog: Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone?
35) 26) dialog: You ask if you can buy her a drink.
35) 30) dialog: You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there.
35) 40) dialog: You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about yourself.
35) 44) dialog: They talk about themselves. A lot.
35) 48) dialog: You act really interested. You nod a lot.
35) 52) dialog: You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place.
35) 56) dialog: No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place.
35) 62) dialog: What, no, I'm not ready for -- (then, to woman) Hi!
35) 72) dialog: Can I buy you a drink, Kate?
35) 77) dialog: I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want.
35) 81) dialog: I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty martini? No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon,  one drink! Picture those ice cubes clinking together. Mmmm. Can't you taste it?
35) 89) dialog: Nothing. We don't want anything. Don't come back here ever.
35) 94) dialog: What do you do, Kate?
35) 100) dialog: I asked you second.
35) 105) dialog: Seriously, what do you do?
35) 111) dialog: Teacher. Interesting. I'm very interested in teaching.
35) 116) dialog: A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people realize...
35) 121) dialog: I'm sorry! I'm supposed to deflect your questions... oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance. And I have children. Plural. More than one. The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either.
35) 128) dialog: I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy.
35) 133) dialog: That's what you took away from that?
35) 139) dialog: It is?
35) 143) dialog: 
35) 153) dialog: Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.
35) 158) dialog: You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me.
35) 164) dialog: I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me.
36) 3) dialog: (gasping for breath) This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife.
36) 14) dialog: I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.
36) 18) dialog: I'm worried you have AIDS.
36) 21) dialog: Only a little.
36) 26) dialog: Show you off to my wife to make her jealous.
36) 29) text: -- The next morning a DISHEVELED CAL lets Kate out, gives her a big passionate kiss, and closes the DOOR.
36) 52) dialog: You're out of your mind. 
36) 56) dialog: It's ridiculous. 
36) 59) dialog: Everyone loves the cherry. Look,  I'm not rejecting the psuedo-  cherry flavors like raspberry or  strawberry, anything in the -erry  family is allowed. But let's be  real here: no one wants the  lemon. No one likes the grape. 
36) 63) dialog: Well then you can't come to my  store. 
40) 4) dialog: 
40) 9) dialog: Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made  a new buddy, I've been spending time with him. Yeah, I'm going to  see her tomorrow night. Of course  I miss her. You don't know how much I miss...
41) 5) dialog: Yeah.
41) 9) dialog: Yeah, but no biggie.
41) 12) dialog: Hey, what's with the moping?
41) 17) dialog: Oh yeah? You like her?
41) 21) dialog: But she's your soulmate?
41) 25) dialog: Well you can't just give up.
41) 36) dialog: I didn't give up.
41) 40) dialog: It was slightly more complicated than that. And I'm a different guy now.
41) 44) dialog: How old ARE you?
41) 50) dialog: Weren't we talking about you? 
43) 9) dialog: Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so...
43) 14) dialog: Thank you.
43) 18) dialog: I talked to Nanna yesterday.
43) 22) dialog: She sounded like... Nanna. She  worries about us. 
43) 28) dialog: I feel like I'm about to get detention.
43) 31) dialog: Which teacher is this?
43) 36) dialog: He's a really weird kid, isn't he?
43) 41) dialog: I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital.
43) 47) dialog: So, how are things with... (a beat, then) How's it going with David? 
43) 53) dialog: No, I know.
43) 60) dialog: Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really.
43) 64) dialog: Yeah, well...
43) 67) dialog: I miss you, T.
43) 70) dialog: I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high  school... you've got the game  sewed up in the first quarter, you know?
43) 73) dialog: I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer.
43) 78) dialog: All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense?
43) 83) dialog: 
43) 89) dialog: I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me.
43) 104) dialog: Oh God. 
43) 108) dialog: (looking to the sky) Really?
43) 112) dialog: Um, yes... we've met before.
43) 120) dialog: Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife. Tracy.
43) 126) dialog: Why don't we head inside?
44) 7) dialog: We have a mutual friend.
44) 11) dialog: You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie?
44) 27) dialog: She's heard it, yes. So in terms of Robbie's progress --
44) 31) dialog: We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book
44) 36) dialog: Because usually he's a very strong public speaker --
44) 40) dialog: 
44) 44) dialog: I can explain.
44) 47) dialog: She's an alcoholic! You can't trust what she says!
45) 3) dialog: Tracy, wait!
46) 3) dialog: Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.
46) 7) dialog: Okay, so --
46) 11) dialog: Tracy, I love you.
46) 21) dialog: It's a funny story, actually --
46) 26) dialog: Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher!
46) 29) dialog: But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!
46) 32) dialog: Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're STILL...
46) 35) dialog: 
46) 40) dialog: (weakly, to himself) I'm your soulmate.
46) 44) dialog: 
46) 53) dialog: 
64) 16) dialog: Hello? 
64) 27) dialog: It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad  you called. Here: I'll walk you  through it. 
64) 32) dialog: Pull it down. 
64) 37) dialog: Now, you see the red button? I  wrote `push' on it? 
64) 41) dialog: Push. Now turn that to the right  and stick the match in. 
64) 49) dialog: Good. Now just close the door and  you're good to go. 
64) 54) dialog: No, anytime. Call anytime with  stuff like that. 
65) 4) dialog: Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner?
65) 8) dialog: Your mom's working till five,  we'll have to tell her. (off their silence)  What do you guys want to do today?
65) 12) dialog: Well, there's a shocker.
65) 19) dialog: Not if that show's on.
65) 23) dialog: Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off.
65) 27) dialog: Beyond your pay-grade, buddy.
65) 30) dialog: I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do...
65) 33) dialog: 
65) 37) dialog: Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show.
65) 41) dialog: I have to --
65) 46) dialog: I'm turning it off --
69) 5) dialog: Bernie. 
69) 9) dialog: Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but  I'm doing something at the old  house tonight and I'm in a bit of  a rush so... yeah. Thanks again  for the cologne. 
71) 8) dialog: Hello?
71) 12) dialog: Oh. My. God. It's alive.
71) 16) dialog: You abandoned me at my time of  need. 
71) 20) dialog: I bet you did.
71) 24) dialog: 
71) 29) dialog: 
71) 39) dialog: You've got my number.
79) 8) dialog: Hi, T.
79) 12) dialog: Almost. Kids? 
79) 18) dialog: 
79) 29) dialog: She's right next to you, T. 
79) 39) dialog: Nanna!
79) 50) dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
79) 59) dialog: Wait, what's going on?
79) 77) dialog: 
79) 84) dialog: No. No. No. No.
79) 100) dialog: 
79) 108) dialog: 
79) 114) dialog: No way -- you and her... no way. End it, now.
79) 119) dialog: Well, then I'm going to murder you.
79) 126) dialog: Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother! (then, looking up)  Bernie?
79) 156) dialog: 
79) 171) dialog: Know what?
79) 185) dialog: Are you pointing at me?
79) 209) dialog: Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?
79) 222) dialog: David Jacobowitz!? 
79) 232) dialog: Stay the hell away from my daughter.
80) 15) dialog: I'll kill you.
80) 44) dialog: Don't.
80) 46) dialog: 
80) 49) dialog: This man is a lowlife and a 
80) 55) dialog: I'm sorry, what? 
80) 60) dialog: You may not be able to see it, but  I have. Over and over again. You are not to see him any more.
80) 65) dialog: Well then I don't have anything  else to say to you. 
80) 70) dialog: 
80) 82) dialog: I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY 
80) 88) dialog: 
80) 105) dialog: She's all yours, David. 
80) 112) dialog: Go big or go home, right, buddy? 
82) 6) dialog: What time is it?
82) 10) dialog: 2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress.
82) 15) dialog: That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick.
82) 25) dialog: What do you want?
82) 29) dialog: I don't know, can you?
82) 37) dialog: 
82) 45) dialog: You still seeing my daughter?
82) 49) dialog: Then I have nothing to say to you.
82) 57) dialog: Sometimes.
82) 61) dialog: I have a lot of vacation days.
82) 65) dialog: I hate the beach... you've got a  lot of nerve coming here --
82) 72) dialog: No, she probably spit in it.
82) 77) dialog: You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic! You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that.
82) 81) dialog: Of course I'm coming. 
82) 85) dialog: He's not my biggest fan right now. 
82) 89) dialog: Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done --
82) 104) dialog: I know you. I know what you are.  You are not good enough for my  daughter. And you will never have  my permission nor my approval. 
83) 49) dialog: Hi.  (awkward, to crowd)  Hi, everyone. 
83) 52) dialog: May I have a word with my son?  It'll just take a second. 
83) 60) dialog: I don't know. What are you doing? 
83) 70) dialog: My son's graduation speech sucks. 
83) 74) dialog: 
83) 78) dialog: In fairness, I don't know where he  was going but I think we can all  agree it was heading in a pretty  depressing direction. And I  basically wrote it for him. I  mean, I didn't literally write it  but I sure as hell influenced it,  and the kid's already a spitting  image of his mother and I'll be  damned if this is what he's going  to get from me. 
83) 81) dialog: My son -- not him, my actual son --  he believes in grand romantic  gestures. He believes that people  have soulmates. And we always  want to tell our thirteen-year-  olds that they're wrong, that `one  day you'll understand, young man.'  But maybe it should be the other  way around. 
83) 84) dialog: I met my soulmate when I was  fifteen years old. Our first  date, we went for ice cream.  After, my dad started teasing me  about my `first date' the way dads  do. And I told him: `stop making  a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go  on lots of dates with plenty of  girls.' That was the first time I  ever lied to my father. 
83) 90) dialog: I met my soulmate when I was  fifteen years old. And I have  loved her with everything I have  for every minute, of every day,  ever since she let me buy her that  first mint chip ice cream. I have  loved her through the birth of our  three perfect children, and I have  loved her even as I've hated her --  only married couples can truly  understand that one. And I don't  know what will wind up happening  with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm  sorry I can't give you that -- but  I promise you this: I will never  stop trying. When you find `the  one' you never give up trying...  and I love you, my amazing boy,  for reminding me of that. 
84) 0) text: The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family.  They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob. 
84) 2) dialog: Hi, Nanna. 
84) 7) dialog: My perfect girl. 
84) 15) dialog: I already ordered a gun. I'm not  kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on  a shady internet site, I can show  you the receipt. If you hurt her,  I am prepared to shoot you in the  face. 
84) 19) dialog: Shut up, Jacob. 
84) 22) dialog: Wow. I like that. 
84) 25) dialog: Is that a new shirt? 
84) 29) dialog: Seriously? 
84) 71) dialog: You okay, buddy? 
84) 85) dialog: We might have to lock him up.
