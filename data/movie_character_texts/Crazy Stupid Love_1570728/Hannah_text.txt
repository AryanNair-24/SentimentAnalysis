3) 2) dialog: I don't care. I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies.
3) 7) dialog: I'm just saying, Richard's a lot  of things: successful, smart...
3) 14) dialog: But he's not very funny, that's  all.
3) 19) dialog: What?
6) 6) dialog: My life is not PG-13!
6) 14) dialog: 
6) 32) dialog: You didn't really just say that.
6) 36) dialog: How old are you?
6) 40) dialog: Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work.

48) 38) dialog: No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
48) 42) dialog: No, I know...
48) 51) dialog: You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am!
48) 54) dialog: I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard.
49) 29) dialog: Do you remember me?

49) 37) dialog: Do you still want to take me home?
49) 42) dialog: Let's go.
50) 8) dialog: This place looks like something out of a men's magazine.
50) 12) dialog: I'm not sure.

50) 20) dialog: Yes, please.
50) 26) dialog: Cheers.
50) 30) dialog: So is this how it normally works?
50) 34) dialog: How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink?
50) 43) dialog: And then you sleep with them?
50) 47) dialog: So that's what happens next? We sleep together?
50) 52) dialog: I'm very nervous.
50) 56) dialog: I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic.
50) 62) dialog: No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here!
50) 71) dialog: I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me!
50) 74) dialog: Okay, okay, this is happening.
50) 79) dialog: I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt.
50) 82) dialog: Holy crap.

52) 3) dialog: 
52) 9) dialog: Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone?
52) 12) dialog: They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course!
