2) 8) dialog: I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna  getcha!
2) 18) dialog: It's okay, my fault.
5) 7) dialog: Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive --
5) 20) dialog: 
9) 6) dialog: I should have knocked.
9) 13) dialog: Robbie!
9) 17) dialog: Stop it!
9) 21) dialog: 
9) 27) dialog: Listen, Robbie --
9) 34) dialog: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was dinner...
9) 69) dialog: Uh-huh.
10) 16) dialog: Yeah.
10) 26) dialog: It's okay.
10) 29) dialog: Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile.
10) 34) dialog: You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy.
10) 37) dialog: In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a
10) 43) dialog: Uh-huh.

20) 110) dialog: Jesus Christ.
37) 21) dialog: What?
38) 3) dialog: Madison! Madison, wait!
38) 6) dialog: Hey, I had a question --
38) 11) dialog: I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side so... 
38) 20) dialog: Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing... I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right?
38) 28) dialog: Lots of college guys, I've heard.
38) 32) dialog: Even rumors about a few teachers.
38) 36) dialog: So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as... well, a kid in high school?
38) 40) dialog: You do, yes.
38) 44) dialog: Yes, I'm sure it does.
38) 48) dialog: No, I don't unfortunately.
38) 52) dialog: Nope.
38) 57) dialog: Old.
38) 63) dialog: Like parent old.
38) 67) dialog: Thank you, Madison.
38) 71) dialog: How?
38) 75) dialog: Huh? 
38) 79) dialog: I'm not following you, Madis--

39) 35) dialog: 
39) 45) dialog: This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously.
39) 49) dialog: I won't.
39) 53) dialog: 
39) 57) dialog: I've been spending time with him for a while.
39) 63) dialog: He's older. I don't want my parents to know.
39) 68) dialog: It doesn't matter.
39) 72) dialog: I don't know. Yes, kind of.
39) 79) dialog: I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop.
39) 82) dialog: I'll see you around, okay?
59) 12) dialog: Hello. 
59) 29) dialog: So... How was dinner? 
59) 33) dialog: 
59) 41) dialog: Did you know your kids are the  only ones I baby-sit for who  always want to stay awake so they  can see their dad when he gets  home. I mean, they fight with  everything they have to keep their  eyes open so they can hear what  Dad had for dinner, or how he  liked the movie. Lot of kids want  to stay awake for Mom -- and your  kids always want to see you, don't  get me wrong -- but not a lot wait  up for Dad. Maybe it's because  he's good, and he's kind, and he's  decent. 
59) 49) dialog: Batshit crazy. 
59) 55) dialog: 
74) 4) dialog: No!!!!
74) 23) dialog: Daddy?
74) 27) dialog: 
79) 134) dialog: Daddy, no!
79) 141) dialog: Daddy!
79) 161) dialog: Daddy, stop!
79) 164) dialog: He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know.
79) 178) dialog: He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him!
79) 183) dialog: (pointing at Cal) With him.
79) 197) dialog: 
80) 31) dialog: I'm so sorry --
81) 5) dialog: 2) at home, grounded and sad. 
84) 40) dialog: I wouldn't have missed it.
84) 50) dialog: Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna  head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while.
84) 56) dialog: Wait: I thought you weren't  giving up. 
84) 61) dialog: It's a good plan.
84) 64) dialog: Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school.
84) 68) dialog: You take care, Robbie.
