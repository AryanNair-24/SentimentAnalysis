6) 25) dialog: Hi. Who looks like a carrot? 
6) 29) dialog: I think your friend Hannah is sexy.
6) 34) dialog: Pretty sure I did.
6) 38) dialog: Thirty-three next month. 
6) 43) dialog: I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line.
6) 51) dialog: There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours. Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact.
6) 57) dialog: Yes you do.
6) 61) dialog: I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied.  Multiple times. 
6) 65) dialog: We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again. 
6) 69) dialog: It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you. 
6) 78) dialog: That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink?
6) 83) dialog: Margarita, rocks, salt.
11) 25) dialog: 
17) 10) dialog: Yeah. 
17) 16) dialog: Don't start conversations with  people while they're pissing. 
18) 31) dialog: 
18) 48) dialog: Jacob Palmer.
18) 53) dialog: I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.
18) 57) dialog: Let me buy you a drink, Cal.
18) 64) dialog: David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you  batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story.
18) 70) dialog: Sit down, Cal.
18) 81) dialog: Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand?
18) 84) dialog: As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say,  without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal. 
18) 87) dialog: You asked me for advice before,  Cal, so I'm going to help you. I  don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it? 
18) 96) dialog: Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say?
18) 101) dialog: Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock.
18) 106) dialog: You ready to go? 
24) 3) dialog: You're late. (then, offering) Sbarro's?
24) 8) dialog: How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?
24) 12) dialog: Three thousand.
24) 16) dialog: We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing.
24) 19) dialog: Take them off.
24) 22) dialog: 
24) 29) dialog: Are you in a fraternity, Cal?
24) 35) dialog: 
24) 40) dialog: Are you Steve Jobs?
24) 44) dialog: 
24) 50) dialog: Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go.
25) 6) dialog: Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items.
25) 10) dialog: You did. I wrote it.
25) 15) dialog: Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers.
25) 23) dialog: Your credit card please?
25) 35) dialog: Take it in there... and there. 
26) 8) dialog: No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap.
26) 12) dialog: In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal.
26) 40) dialog: You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning.
26) 44) dialog: 
26) 56) dialog: Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor  cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about... He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.
26) 60) dialog: ... inch off the top.
27) 3) dialog: What are you putting on?
27) 7) dialog: Perfect. (then, to Tiffany) You smell great by the way.
27) 12) dialog: What are you doing tonight?
27) 16) dialog: That's okay, I do.
27) 21) dialog: Yes, Cal, just like that.
27) 24) dialog: Yes. Yes.
27) 36) dialog: Yep.
27) 40) dialog: Shut up, Cal.
27) 51) dialog: You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link.
27) 56) dialog: No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover.
28) 6) dialog: No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be  calling women over to our table shortly.
28) 11) dialog: Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing  I need to know: how many women have you been with?
28) 15) dialog: Yes.
28) 19) dialog: No, synchronized swimming. Yes,  Cal. Sexually. 
28) 28) dialog: Wow, okay... wow. (then, checking)  Not at a time? Total? 
28) 36) dialog: Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.
28) 40) dialog: Shut up, Cal.
28) 45) dialog: Hi. Jacob Palmer. 
28) 57) dialog: 
28) 64) dialog: Can I get you a drink, Amy?
28) 71) dialog: Tell me about yourself. What do you do?
28) 75) dialog: It does to me.
28) 78) dialog: It does to me.
28) 93) dialog: Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting. I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once.
28) 100) dialog: 
28) 102) dialog: Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just... I think we should get out of here.
28) 111) dialog: I think we should get out of here.
28) 119) dialog: I think we should get out of here.
35) 0) text: Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.
35) 5) dialog: I think you're ready, Cal.
35) 11) dialog: To talk to a woman, take a woman home.
35) 15) dialog: You've been watching me do it for two weeks.
35) 19) dialog: Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the  kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually  building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?
35) 24) dialog: Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?
35) 28) dialog: And what if she says no?
35) 32) dialog: When she asks me a question about myself?
35) 42) dialog: And what happens?
35) 46) dialog: And what do I do?
35) 50) dialog: And at the end of the night?
35) 54) dialog: Do I ask?
35) 60) dialog: Oh, and no talking about your job,  your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go...
35) 69) dialog: Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal.
36) 50) dialog: ... it would work! 
36) 54) dialog: What do college guys hate? Doing  laundry. What do they love?  Strippers. It's a strip club  where they can do their laundry. 
36) 57) dialog: And yours isn't? A candy store  that only sells red candy. 
36) 61) dialog: I like grape. 
49) 14) dialog: 
49) 31) dialog: Yes.
49) 35) dialog: Yes.
49) 39) dialog: Yes.
50) 10) dialog: Is that a compliment?
50) 17) dialog: I thought you would.
50) 24) dialog: Cheers.
50) 32) dialog: What?
50) 40) dialog: Yes. That's how it normally works.
50) 45) dialog: Yes.
50) 49) dialog: At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan.
50) 54) dialog: I'm getting that.
50) 59) dialog: You're adorable.
50) 69) dialog: I don't think people say `bang' anymore.
50) 77) dialog: What?
50) 87) dialog: Now take off yours.
50) 94) dialog: 
52) 6) dialog: I'm glad you like it.
52) 25) dialog: 
52) 30) dialog: 
52) 36) dialog: Five thousand doll-- 
52) 44) dialog: Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself.
52) 48) dialog: C'mon, one question.
52) 52) dialog: Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past
52) 61) dialog: Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold.
52) 65) dialog: He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have...
52) 68) dialog: Stuff like this.
52) 74) dialog: My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually...
54) 4) dialog: 
71) 10) dialog: Hey, Cal. 
71) 14) dialog: I'm sorry. I know I've been out  of circulation. 
71) 18) dialog: I've been a little... things have  gotten a bit... I met a woman. 
71) 22) dialog: No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman.
71) 27) dialog: Actually, tonight... I'm going to  meet her mother. 
71) 34) dialog: Yes, I realize that, asshole.
71) 37) dialog: Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?
71) 42) dialog: Thanks. 
79) 44) dialog: Cal?
79) 52) dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
79) 69) dialog: 
79) 74) dialog: 
79) 96) dialog: 
79) 105) dialog: 
79) 118) dialog: Well, that's not going to happen.
79) 220) dialog: David Jacobowitz!
79) 229) dialog: You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!?
80) 45) dialog: 
80) 93) dialog: (one last try) Cal, c'mon --
81) 8) dialog: 
82) 20) dialog: 
82) 23) dialog: It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal.
82) 27) dialog: Can I sit?
82) 35) dialog: Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children?
82) 40) dialog: Okay, so like children then. Move over.
82) 43) dialog: I'd like to talk.
82) 47) dialog: Yes.
82) 51) dialog: Cal.
82) 55) dialog: You been hanging out here a lot?
82) 59) dialog: Must be missing a lot of work.
82) 63) dialog: Some vacation.
82) 70) dialog: You want a sip?
82) 75) dialog: Your kids miss you.
82) 79) dialog: His eighth grade graduation is  next week. You coming? 
82) 83) dialog: Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal.
82) 87) dialog: Oh, that's a good excuse -- 
82) 91) dialog: I love her, Cal. 
82) 94) dialog: I've never been in love before.  Honestly, I've never even been in  `like' before. 
82) 101) dialog: She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal.
82) 107) dialog: I'll see you at graduation. 
84) 0) text: The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family.  They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob. 
84) 17) dialog: Cal, I'm not going to -- 
84) 27) dialog: Hannah took me to the Gap. It's  actually not as bad as I thought. 
84) 31) dialog: Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap.  I got this at Nordstrom's.
