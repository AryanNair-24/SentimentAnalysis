5) 14) dialog: Close the door!
9) 3) dialog: I'm sorry that you had to see that.
9) 11) dialog: For the record: I think about you while I do it --
9) 15) dialog: I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time --
9) 19) dialog: I love you, Jessica. And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the  same age as your little brother,  and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because...
9) 22) dialog: 
9) 24) dialog: I'm pretty sure you're my soulmate.
9) 31) dialog: Shit.
9) 45) dialog: Dad?
9) 49) dialog: You're getting divorced?
9) 55) dialog: And you jumped out of a car?
9) 64) dialog: I'm sorry you jumped out of a car.
20) 8) dialog: So... you're like, actually going  to live here?
20) 27) dialog: Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her.
20) 30) dialog: You okay?
20) 35) dialog: Can I say something with a curse? One time?
20) 40) dialog: Love is fucked. 
20) 45) dialog: Well, if you must know --
20) 50) dialog: What is she doing here?
20) 60) dialog: What?
20) 70) dialog: But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that!
20) 81) dialog: Wait, where are you going?
20) 98) dialog: But, Dad --
20) 103) dialog: I don't need a baby-sitter.
20) 108) dialog: I love you so much --
30) 33) dialog: You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to  read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing.
32) 8) dialog: Sorry.
33) 6) dialog: I guess.
33) 18) dialog: He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot.
33) 23) dialog: He's sad. He looks better, but... sadder, too, I think. You know?
33) 27) dialog: I know.
33) 31) dialog: I heard you crying the other night  and... I didn't know what to do.  I'm thirteen years old and... can  you just tell me what I'm supposed  to do in that situation? I didn't  want to Google it. 
33) 40) dialog: I'm okay with being like you, Mom.  I like you. 
33) 45) dialog: It'll be okay, Mom.
33) 59) dialog: Okay. Okay.
33) 68) dialog: So, David... I hear you broke up my parents' marriage.
33) 71) dialog: You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting?
33) 75) dialog: Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably  math. And she still loves him. 
33) 80) dialog: Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now,  but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that.
33) 85) dialog: 
39) 5) dialog: 
39) 21) dialog: Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.'
39) 24) dialog: I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the  one! I know it to be true, and so  now do the multitude.
39) 29) dialog: I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me.
39) 38) dialog: You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it.
39) 47) dialog: You'll learn to love me. I promise.
39) 51) dialog: Just because I'm four years younger than you?
39) 60) dialog: No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last
39) 66) dialog: Who is he?
39) 70) dialog: Do I know him? Is he from town?
39) 76) dialog: I'll kill him if he hurts you.
39) 87) dialog: Yeah.
41) 3) dialog: So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing?
41) 7) dialog: First time in a while.
41) 14) dialog: Nothing. It's just... there's  this girl.
41) 19) dialog: I like Pringles. This girl's my  soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid,  in love with her. And she wants  someone else.
41) 23) dialog: Yeah.
41) 31) dialog: Why not? (then, quietly) You did.
41) 34) dialog: Mom was yours, right? 
41) 38) dialog: Listen, Dad. I love you. I have your back, always. But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car.
41) 42) dialog: You're the same guy. You just have different clothes. Do you  still love her?
41) 46) dialog: 
41) 52) dialog: We are. Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration. So set an example for your boy.  Don't give up. It's complicated? Uncomplicate it. She says no? Change her mind. Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad. Get her back.
60) 5) dialog: at top of the stairs, regarding the flowers. 
65) 6) dialog: Sure.
65) 15) dialog: She still won't talk to you?
65) 21) dialog: No, I mean, Mom.
65) 25) dialog: What happened?
76) 5) dialog: Dad's here. 
76) 8) dialog: I have to blindfold you.
76) 17) dialog: Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive.
76) 21) dialog: Okay, we're good, let's do this.
79) 23) dialog: 
79) 61) dialog: Hey, Nanna.
79) 136) dialog: Is that Jessica?
79) 169) dialog: Know what?
79) 176) dialog: (struggling with it) I'm TRYING!
79) 181) dialog: With who?
79) 187) dialog: Are you pointing at him?
79) 191) dialog: 
79) 200) dialog: You made him dirty pictures? Oh God.
79) 206) dialog: 
80) 115) dialog: Go home, Dad. 
83) 28) dialog: (a bit monotone)  Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.  Welcome, Class of 2011. 
83) 32) dialog: I grew up a lot this year, I  think. I used to think that  growing up meant really growing.  Like getting taller and bigger.  But now I think that growing up  just makes you smaller. Your  dreams get smaller, and what you  want gets smaller...  (beat, then)  I grew an inch and a half this  year, but I feel a lot smaller. 
83) 35) dialog: I was in love. And I know that  makes parents laugh because I'm  only thirteen but whatever, I was. 
83) 42) dialog: I believed that there was one true  love for everyone, and if you  fought for that person, your one  true love would always work out.  But that's not how it works. It  sounded good when I was younger,  but... it's just not how it works.  There's no such thing as one true  love for everyo-- 
83) 47) dialog: Dad? 
83) 57) dialog: 
83) 63) dialog: I was wrong, Dad. There's no such  thing as -- 
83) 94) dialog: I still love you, Jessica! I've  loved you since the first time you  changed my sister's diaper! I've  loved you since... 
84) 0) text: The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family.  They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob. 
84) 38) dialog: It was nice of you to come.
84) 43) dialog: So, how are things with your dad? 
84) 52) dialog: Yeah, probably a good idea.
84) 58) dialog: I'm not. But I figure: you like  my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then.
84) 78) dialog:
