On the floor by the door: A bird cage. Inside: A little, fat budgie. Malorie bends down, cups her hands... And transfers the bird to a shoebox. It coos at her as she covers the box and hefts it. Malorie then picks up her blindfold. Before donning it, she looks around. Inside, all is quiet and still. A land-line phone sits on the coffee table. Nothing else around it. As if it were a holy relic. Malorie secures her blindfold. Reaches out and grips the door handle. Takes a breath.

1) 4) dialog: (sotto) Twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one. Malorie raises her hand... And touches a tree branch. She lets out a breath of relief. And she changes direction once more. Boy and Girl adapt. The sound of the river creeps in. Malorie quietly counts her steps. Then: A sound. Rustling. The sigh of foliage. Boy’s ear perks. He pauses. It stops the train. Boy and Girl turn their heads the same direction. Beat. Listening. Then, another rustle. Back the way they came. The budgie inside the shoebox CHIRPS. Its wings scrape against the box lid.
1) 6) dialog: (sotto) Forty-nine, fifty, fifty-one, fifty- two, fifty three... fifty-four. The sound of the river is close. Malorie reaches out and down... But her fingers grasp air. No landmark here. Malorie sweeps her arm around. Still nothing. Somewhere off to the right: Leaves rustle. Closer. The budgie CHIRPS in distress. Girl tugs at Malorie’s arm. Malorie starts to hyperventilate. She steps forward. Groping.

The other one is bleeding profusely. A c over her forehead has bathed her face in blood.

16) 28) dialog: Okay. She pulls a thin, folded blanket from under her, what she been using as a cushion, and drapes it over herself and B creating a little cocoon in the boat. The blanket is soak from the collision. It’s useless to dry the Boy. With the blanket fully covering both the boy and her ina makeshift fort, Malorie pulls off her blindfold. Boy is shivering uncontrollably. Hypothermia. His forehead is bruised.
16) 30) dialog: You need to dry off and warm up.
16) 32) dialog: We lost the rest, and this is too wet. So I’m going to get some more and bring them back. Okay? 28. Boy nods.

16) 37) dialog: Sit back-to-back. Listen closely. The bird stays with you. Malorie shoves the row boat with her one remaining oar un it wedges against the shore. She then takes the soaked blanket. And very gingerly steps out of the boat. Boy’s teeth rattle and he makes a noise when he exhales.
16) 38) dialog: Shh. Boy screws up his face, mustering courage. Two steps into the woods, Malorie stops. Reaches out. Finds a branch. On her belt: a reel of fishing wire. Weighted at the end with a sinker. Malorie loops the end around the base of the branch. Tugs at it. It’s solid. She ventures into the trees. The fishing wire unspools as she goes. Pointing her back to the boat. 29. The reel makes a sound; soft clicking. Girl and Boy listen to it recede.
17) 0) text: Malorie moves with one arm out in front of her face and another panning left and right. She walks quickly, even blind. She finds a tree, then navigates around it. The reel clicks softly at her belt. A rustling sound. Malorie freezes. Holds her breath. Then the sound of flapping wings, overhead. Birds. Malorie breathes again. Visibly relieved. She marches on. Distantly: tiny bell-song from a wind chime. That suggests a back porch. A house. Another half dozen steps puts her into a clearing. Her foot nudges something. She crouches down. Feels. Stands up clutching a metal rod. Her hands work their way up the metal-- it’s long. She finds the end: A net. This is a pool cleaner. Malorie holds one end and reaches out to thump the ground ahead of her, in an arc. Soft thump... Soft thump... Concrete. Malorie advances in that direction. Ahead of her: A dilapidated two-story HOUSE. With a backyard pool, now scummy with algae. The cleaner dips into the green water. Splashes. Malorie course corrects to walk around it.
19) 0) text: Sunlight pours in from bay windows, illuminating dust in stale air inside. The back door vibrates with a loud thump. Again. And then it’s forcibly kicked in by Malorie. She steps inside. Tense. All is quiet. It’s a five-bedroom mausoleum. Malorie finds a chair. And a table. It’s a breakfast table. Nearby: A counter. The kitchen. She takes a step deeper into the house-- And the fishing wire goes taut. End of the line. Malorie curses to herself.

22) 1) text: Malorie rifles through clothes on racks. Finds a heavy coat. Too big. But better than nothing. Ready to go, she dons a clean, dry beach towel.
23) 2) text: Straight ahead, staring at the fabric of the towel, all t filters through is a vague rectangle of sunlight. And then a shadow passes in front of it. Large. Devouring the gauzy sunlight. Malorie goes rigid with fear. Slowly, she reaches up and puts on her blindfold.
24) 0) text: Malorie stays low, following the line. Listening intently. Something is near. In the pool. What isn’t heard: breathing noises. It’s unsettling. 33. Malorie’s hand follows the fishing line. Her foot steps on the pool net she dropped before. Off to her right, more water sounds. Something emerging from the pool. Malorie does something very risky: She runs while blindfolded.

36) 9) dialog: Keep going around. Tom goes for the shifter. Something crashes, outside. Glass breaks. Everyone remains quiet. The car idles. Then: Beep. Front bumper proximity. Growing more incessant.
36) 12) dialog: (sotto) Oh god, oh god-- The group looks up: Dents form in the roof. The middle bows. A muted, rhythmi RASPING carries heavy from outside. Felix sweats, his hand gripping the axe. 52. The roof bows over the back seat. Lucy holds up her golf club at it, as if to prevent the r from caving in. It trembles in her hands. Everyone in the car is on the verge of panic. Then the rear end lowers. It’s walked onto the trunk. Lucy and Felix look back at the rear window, even though walled off with tape and box lids. Glass cracks. And then, out of the tense silence: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. Rear bumper proximity. Suddenly: something strikes HARD at the back window-- The taped glass caves inward from it-- exposing the outsi

The smell is definitely coming from this end of the store Malorie brings up a flashlight. She rounds a corner. More flies buzz from a neighboring section. Malorie shines her light on the sign: “FOR PETS” She frowns, and advances.
45) 0) text: The flashlight beam reveals a line of cages placed on she along one side. A trampled sign on the floor: “TODAY ONLY / ADOPT A PET!” Some cages hang open. Empty. 57. The flashlight glimpses shapes in others. Matted fur. Blo and feces. In this low light it’s hard to tell if they ar cats or dogs. Malorie winces, covering her nose and mouth. And then she hears it. A small CHIRP. She turns back. Sweeps the light. Finds a bird cage at th end, covered in black silk. Malorie lifts the veil and peers inside: Six fat, little BUDGIES turn their heads at her.

GREG’S HOUSE - FIVE YEARS EARLIER - NIGHT Pressing in on the back door, set into a “mud room” off t kitchen, with a place for boots, heavy coats, etc. Malorie (long-haired, seven-months pregnant now) enters f outside, carrying a paint bucket filled with water. She’s also wearing a blindfold. Her breath plumes in the night Just as she shuts the door behind her, we catch a glimpse the setup: The back door has a tarpaulin hood covering vi of the outside, attached to a small awning, so it creates little cocoon just outside the door.

She scoots the book toward her, flips through the pages. And then picks up the receiver. Holds it to her ear. Remarkably, there is still a dial tone. (This is probable only with old landline telephony. ) Malorie flips to the yellow pages section and finds a lis for the hospitals. She starts dialing. Behind her, over her shoulder, the open kitchen area. And farther still, the back door in the mud room. That area i unlit now, but the white of the back door stands out. And the door starts to open. Malorie doesn’t hear. She’s busy trying numbers. PRESSING IN on Malorie as she dials and listens for a wor number on the other end, edging out the view of the door the kitchen as something gets closer... Then that sound. That otherworldly, inhuman noise. Malorie’s whole body goes rigid with sudden fear. She snaps her eyes closed and leans down into the couch t try and hide. Her shallow breath is overtaken by the sound of rasping. Close on her face, eyes firmly shut, and then-- Two ragged FINGERS with wet, black talons on the ends rea in and press against her cheek and eyebrow. Malorie whimp in shock, tries to turn away from the contact, but then-- 66.

The room is crowded with listeners, including Malorie, Donald, Cheryl, and Gary. The furniture in the room has been moved since last time. A thin line of SUNLIGHT slices into the room from the curtains hanging on the picture window. This is the only of sun in the room, possibly the whole house. At the bar counter leading to the kitchen, Lucy stands an stares at the calendar. September 3 has an ‘X’ through it along with the next two days after it.

62) 3) dialog: What did you do? Before all this. 84.
62) 5) dialog: Oh my god! Ohh. I can’t remember the last time I laughed. Thank you. She puts her hand on his chest. He keeps it there. An unspoken invitation to tenderness. Malorie’s eyes sparkle

70) 0) text: Olympia and Malorie lie on their backs on the floor, atop mattresses covered with beach towels. Both are sweaty, tr to control their breathing. A sheet covers Olympia’s lap, a throw covers Malorie’s. It’s raining, outside. Lightly. The rain tap-dances on th skylights above. There isn’t enough light to get a good s of the walls in the room. A lantern sits on a rolling table near the women. Curled by the lantern: TWO LEATHER BELTS, still with their Targe price tags stuck to the buckles. Malorie MOANS. And looks to Olympia. Olympia looks back. Scared.
70) 2) dialog: Tom? Tom! Donald arrives and sets the towels by a set of tools: A pair of scissors. A knife. Metal binder clips.

The lantern illuminates the wall, exposing DOZENS OF CHAR SKETCHES OF MONSTERS. All shapes and sizes. Creatures wit hideous bodies and human faces. Things with no discernibl head or tail. Beasts inspired by snakes, and spiders, and squid, and grizzly bears. Thin, gangly beings with hollow heads. A coterie of teeth, venom, and unblinking stares. entire wall is papered with the artwork. Malorie shudders in shock at it.
73) 10) dialog: You've... seen one? Edgar nods. Nearby Olympia makes a noise as she pushes ag somewhere between a cry and a groan.
73) 11) dialog: (calling)
73) 15) dialog: Tom! Is that you?! Tom-- More loud noises downstairs. And then footsteps. The door opens, and Tom steps through. He looks unhinged, holding the shotgun Donald had moments ago.
73) 17) dialog: I’m early, we're both early, it just started and then my water broke and I don’t want it now--
73) 19) dialog: Don’t go. Don’t go. Tom leans down and kisses Malorie on the forehead.

73) 26) dialog: Shut up shut up-- And then another heart-stopping GUNSHOT, this time from t second floor. And in that vacuum of silence... Sounds from the stairs. Creaking of steps. And the sound of the door opening. Edgar looks up, toward the door. And frowns.

73) 39) dialog: 
74) 0) text: Malorie descends, still cradling both babies. She wears a stretch of towel as a blindfold. The boy and girl are covered as well. And she’s snipped and clamped her umbilical cord. From the ground floor, the phone continues to ring. 101. Carefully, cautiously, she crosses the hall. Her foot steps on a body. In a pool of blood. Malorie trembles. And steps over the body.
75) 0) text: Malorie descends the last few steps and nearly slips on m blood in the entry. The front door hangs wide open. She passes by another body on the floor. The phone rings. For the tenth time.
76) 0) text: Malorie sits down on the couch. Felix’s body is seated on the other end of the couch. But his head is missing. The phone rings loudly on the coffee table. Malorie’s hand reaches out... finds it. Just as it stops ringing. Malorie brings it to her ear, hopeful--
76) 1) dialog: Hello? Hello? A faint dial tone bleeds out, audible from here.
76) 2) dialog: No... No no no-- She hangs up and presses asterisk-6-9. Holds the phone to her ear again, in time to hear the hig octave three tones preceding:
77) 0) text: The sun hangs low over the lawn, where a fire burns. A bonfire made of a pile of bodies. Malorie stands a dozen paces away, hearing it burn. She wears a scarf over her eyes. And carries a pole on her shoulders. Water jugs dangle from the pole. In this pose, in this light, she looks like Lady Justice. Among the burning bodies: The ADOPTION FLYER she took fro the hospital so long ago. “You have a choice!” It catches fire.
78) 0) text: A year later. The two crib-forts sit in the room. Covered by a blanket. Malorie arrives. Trembling. Holding a hypodermic needle in her hand. Outside, something bumps against the house. A tree, maybe. The wind. Malorie approaches the cribs. Draws back the blanket. Inside: Boy and Girl. Each maybe a year old. Asleep. Fitful sleep. Malorie cries silently. Reaches in with the needle. 103. The pointy tip is charred black from heat. Pointed straight down. Shaking in her grip. It hovers over Boy’s left eyelid. An inch. Less. Malorie’s fingers reach and open Boy’s eye. A breath from receiving the needle. Something creaks nearby. Something stirs. Malorie looks up and recoils in surprise. Girl sits up in her crib. Looking at Malorie. Head tilted. Just watching. Innocent. Confused. Malorie puts a hand to her mouth. Drops the needle. Slumps against the wall. A mess. For a long time, she sits there.
79) 0) text: Eyes and nose red from tears, Malorie steps in. Stares at her reflection in the mirror. She reaches out, picks up a pair of scissors. Brings them to her face... And then starts to cut her own hair. PANNING to the mirror... It’s now the end of the haircut. Short-cropped. A warrior’s cut. Malorie hardens her face. She’s made a decision: Survival. But on her terms.
80) 0) text: Two years later. Boy and Girl are both nearly the age of the opener. Playing with simple toys. Sounds of HAMMERING nearby. Malorie reinforces a wood plank over a window. Muscular arms. Still short hair. When she’s done, she steps back. 104.
80) 1) dialog: All right. Going out for dinner. You remember the rules? The children nod. Malorie nods back, like a sergeant. She crosses past a wall now covered with a giant Riverbri city map, likely taken from a municipal building. The map riddled with push-pins. She’s covered a lot of ground. Before Malorie leaves for the back door--
80) 3) dialog: Yes, Girl.
80) 5) dialog: (beat) We'll see.
81) 0) text: Quiet. Stillness. Malorie crouches, following a string. Her boots crunch under the winter ground. The string leads to a rabbit trap. Something furry caught inside. Malorie feels it: A dead rabbit.
82) 0) text: Malorie, still blindfolded, carries two dead rabbits tied together, marching cautiously toward the back door. Her hand searches for the fence line. Finds it. Her familiar landmark. She takes a breath. Distantly... A phone rings. Malorie perks up. Hurries for the back door. Abandoning the rabbits. She gets to the back door. Struggles with the keys. Rinnnng!
83) 0) text: The phone rings loudly in here. Boy and Girl stand arguing about it. A door slams and Malorie runs in--
83) 2) dialog: I got it-- She grabs the receiver and answers, breathless--
83) 3) dialog: Hello!
83) 5) dialog: Yes! Yes, that’s me, yes.
83) 7) dialog: Rick what?
83) 9) dialog: Oh thank god. (emotional) Where are you, Rick? Are you safe? Are... are you with others? 105. 106.
83) 11) dialog: Rick... Do you, do you have room for three more? Asked as if it were the most important question on Earth.
83) 14) dialog: Riverbridge. Upper east side, near state highway one-eighty.
83) 16) dialog: What’s wrong with the river?
84) 0) text: Catching up to the trip on the river. Late in the afternoon. The sun hangs low. Short-haired Malorie rows. Girl plays with her three puzzle pieces. They all hear something, ahead. Rapids.
84) 1) dialog: Children? It’s nearly time.
84) 3) dialog: To look. This is what’s wrong with the river. Girl whips her head around at Malorie-- “look?” Malorie steadies the boat with the oar. Slows down. 107. Birds SQUAWK and CAW in flight overhead.
84) 4) dialog: There are many rocks here, and the water is shallow in places. But we need to land before the waterfall.
84) 6) dialog: This time is different. We can’t miss the first landmark. The statue. Remember the steps?
84) 8) dialog: Good. Landmarks?
84) 11) dialog: That’s a good sign. It means everything’s all right. The row boat gently moves downstream. Overhead: The birds chatter, in migration. It’s a chorus of normalcy. The sound of the river rapids gets nearer.
84) 12) dialog: We're close. I am going to look now. Okay? Malorie grabs for her blindfold. Hooks a thumb underneath it. But a new sound gives her pause: The birds. They sound more aggressive. 108. The chatter becomes a psychotic symphony. CLOSE ON THE FLOCK in midair. They crash headlong into each other. They pick at their wings mid-flight. They attack one another. Beaks. Feathers. Blood. Drops of blood land on Malorie’s face. Around them: splashes. Everything is not all right. Birds dropping like feathered meteors. Boy and Girl tense up.
84) 15) dialog: We hit a rock. In the shoebox, their budgie begins CHIRPING. Girl stiffens in alarm. TIGHT ON her face:
84) 17) text: Malorie splashes in, toppled off the boat. BOY and GIRL drop in nearby, but travel faster underwater the current, their limbs wheeling for purchase-- Overhead, on the surface, the boat upends. Malorie reaches out for Boy as he passes by-- Her blindfold still around her face-- And then the water cavitates at Malorie’s leg and somethi SPLASHES in and grabs hold of her ankle-- But the foaming water and chaos is too much to get any so of distinct look at it-- is it a hand? A claw? It’s pale- Boy and Girl drift past, still carried by the water-- Malorie kicks hard-- gets free, goes up for air--
85) 3) dialog: Go! Find the statue! Boy leads Girl off the shore, reaching ahead still blindfolded, arm outstretched until it touches-- 110. A FIGURE towering over Boy. Made of stone. The Virgin Mary, eight feet tall. Boy touches it. Confirms it. Then he calls out to Malorie:
85) 5) dialog: Keep talking!
85) 8) dialog: I'm here, I’m here.
85) 10) dialog: You two follow the steps. Go. Now. Boy doesn’t need to be told twice. He grabs Girl and goes But Girl’s head still faces Malorie, asking:
85) 12) dialog: 
85) 20) dialog: Oh god--
85) 21) dialog: Hitting hard in the brook, clamping her eyes shut again. But this is just a little stream full of rocks. Her arm i cut and possibly broken by the fall. STAYING WITH MALORIE again as she gets up and climbs the other bank of the stream. Breathless. Trees bend and fall into frame behind her. Crashing. One comes down frightfully close to her. A hailstorm of leaves descend around her.
85) 22) dialog: Keep running!
85) 27) dialog: Running. Lost. Eyes squeezed shut. Bleeding from cuts. Favoring one leg. The monsters thunder behind her like a herd of buffalo. Then-- the inevitable. Malorie trips. Takes a hard spill on the ground.
85) 32) dialog: Stay. AWAY. She finds her strength again and rises. Clutching something in her fist. A knife. She raises it in threatening gesture--
85) 33) dialog: I’m not going to look at you. Then she turns the knife blade on herself. Holds its tip a centimeter from her eyelid.
85) 34) dialog: I’1l make sure of it. Beat. Remaining TIGHT on Malorie, glimpsing only briefly one of those things behind her, blurred, moving unlike anything lives in this reality. Sounds of movement, around her. She presses the blade to her lid. Piercing it enough to elicit a drop of blood. The monsters all retreat. As if they somehow know, as the did in the attic: She won’t look. With that, Malorie collapses again to the ground. PULLING BACK AND UP, revealing more of the world around Malorie. The creatures always just offscreen. Their shadows from the sun dance over her body, elongated distorted beyond accurate description as they retreat. 115.
86) 0) text: Peering out through the narrow opening in the door, over Rick’s shoulder. Malorie limps the final steps of the barbed-wire corridor drawn to Rick’s voice.
86) 4) dialog: Yes, you can look. She pulls at their blindfolds. Boy and Girl look around at all the people. And at the sk And the trees. 116. They want to look everywhere at once. Because they’ve nev seen any of it before. Rick crouches down beside them.
86) 8) dialog: No. (to Boy) Your name is Tom. (to Girl) And yours is Olympia. Boy and Girl look at Malorie with wonder. Girl gasps. Their faces light up like it’s Christmas morning.
86) 13) dialog: Yes. I’m their mother. FADE OUT. THE END.
