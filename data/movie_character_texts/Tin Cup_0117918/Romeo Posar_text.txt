2) 0) text: A man, JOSE, is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work. (We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.) Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY "TIN CUP" McAVOY stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them, really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between his legs. Behind him: A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT, EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his preferred libation in the other. They're all looking back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to: ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante, best friend.
2) 1) dialog: Okay, all bets are down! Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful, until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.
2) 3) dialog: Number one is the winner! Dewey has the winner. Pays five to two! Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money fro the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing gambling. Tin Cup looks over.
5) 2) dialog: Shut up, boss -- we got the Corpus Christi dog track on the dish --
5) 5) dialog: All she knows is she likes the three dog 'cause his name is Pride of Odessa 'cause she's from Odessa.
5) 7) dialog: You gave her twenty to one --
5) 11) dialog: Twelve thousand.
5) 13) text: Hundred. ROMEO
5) 15) text: (panicky) Hundred. ROMEO
5) 20) text: Uh-oh. The three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the rail. It has a ten length lead as it moves down the backstretch and past the toteboard. The race is over -- the three dog wins. Deathly silence. Somebody flips OFF the TV. Finally, in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, Romeo speaks -- ROMEO
6) 0) text: The marquee advertises: EXOTIC DANCERS/STEAK $4.00. parking lot is full of pickup trucks and beer cans. Tin Cup and Romeo head toward the entrance.
6) 1) dialog: We lost everything, boss! We owe Doreen twelve thousand bucks!
6) 3) dialog: Them big-haired blondes are a lot smarter 'n us... (beat)
6) 6) dialog: It's a bad habit I picked up from knowing you so long.
7) 9) dialog: You're looking particularly lovely this evening -- This is nicer than the leopard suit --
7) 12) dialog: We going to pay you.
7) 19) text: Only on condition you don't sell right away, and me'n Romeo keep our jobs. DOREEN
9) 0) text: Tin Cup's domicile, parked near a slow-moving river. The red Cadillac is parked out front next to Romeo's Mercury Comet.
9) 1) dialog: (with horror, inside
10) 2) dialog: But your clubs are your livelihood.
10) 5) dialog: David Simms!   What you doing in town? Romeo steps outside to greet Simms.   Warily.
11) 0) text: Romeo and Simms under the awning.   A spiffy new car parked nearby. DAVID SIMMS, 38, looking every bit like the successful tour pro he is... Payne Stewart to Tin Cup's Maynard G. Krebs.
11) 2) dialog: He's on business in Houston... You supposed to be out playin' on the golf tour.
11) 4) text: (unfazed) Well, you tell him I'm in town for my big charity best-ball tournament, and I got a spot for him when he comes back from... whatever. ROMEO
11) 6) text: Romeo! You wound me. I'm fond of the guy, going way back to our days at University of Houston, when we won all those titles together. ROMEO
11) 8) text: I didn't have much craft back then -- just a little native ability. Roy's a great ball- striker.... ROMEO
11) 21) text: No, Roy. I didn't mean I want you to play with me. I just want you to caddie for me, read my putts, club me, that kinda stuff. Tin Cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy.   His hand falls free of Simms's. Words fail him. ROMEO
11) 24) text: I can't bring a guy in off the street to play in my tournament. It's a big-time event, corporate sponsors, thirty dollar tickets... I got a network to cover -- ROMEO
11) 29) dialog: Get the hell outta here! Take your goddamn color coordinated corporate sponsored soul and get outta here.
11) 35) dialog: We'll take the job. Simms nods in agreement, and exits.    Tin Cup stands the with Romeo, feeling humiliated.
11) 38) dialog: You mean like... success?
14) 20) dialog: He can. All the players look at Romeo as: Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of the water to a smattering of polite applause. Simms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup retrieves the divot. And:
17) 0) text: Romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can of water where the balls are washing. Tin Cup sits on a bench, alternately swigging cheap whiskey and Maalox.
17) 2) text: If I had it all to do over, I'd still hit that shot. ROMEO
17) 4) text: The look comes over your face, you would bury yourself alive to prove you can handle a shovel. Tin Cup looks over at Romeo for signs of an implied pejorative. But Romeo's just washing and scooping balls... and looking badly in need of perspective. TIN CUP
17) 5) text: You know why I'd still hit that shot? Now Romeo looks over... and he decides that Tin Cup is the one in need of perspective. ROMEO
17) 8) text: I'd hit it again because that shot was a defining moment. And when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you. I did not shrink from the challenge. I rose to it. Romeo nods, holding his peace. ROMEO
17) 10) text: I was playing to win. ROMEO
17) 15) dialog: You're right about that, boss, but sometimes... sometimes... par is good enough to win. Tin Cup tosses down another Maalox cocktail.
23) 0) text: Romeo ponders Tin Cup's dilemma from the couch.
23) 1) dialog: Man, you are having a bad week.
23) 3) dialog: She don't know you live in a Winnebago.
23) 6) dialog: Well... you could go out and win The Open.
23) 8) text: Romeo, that idea has promise.
23) 9) dialog: I was joking.
23) 12) dialog: We talking about the same tournament? The U.S. Open? The Biggest golf tournament in the world?
23) 14) dialog: What do you mean?
23) 16) dialog: And then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated --
23) 18) dialog: You don't got the game.
23) 20) dialog: I said you don't got the game. The mental game. The head game.
23) 22) dialog: You always go out to shoot zero. Sometimes you pull it off. But you can't play like that at the Open. You win by taking what the course gives you. You win by being humble, which you aren't, and patient, which you never will
23) 25) dialog: You don't ever listen to me.
23) 27) dialog: I don't know, man. Right now you don't even got the money to get your clubs out of hock.
26) 6) dialog: You got Boone shakin' already -- (studying the approach)
27) 0) text: Boone gazes with malicious delight at Tin Cup's ball, buried in the front left bunker. He watches Tin Cup take the hoe from Romeo and move down into the trap.
28) 0) text: Tin Cup and Romeo emerge, Romeo carrying T.C.'s sticks.
28) 2) dialog: No. My job is to get your head straight so you can qualify for The Open, much less win it. To get your head straight you got to forget about the doctor lady. They head up the street under a collonade toward Tin Cup's waiting Caddy.
28) 4) dialog: Then you got no problem telling the doctor lady you can't teach her no more till after the Open. Tin Cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly corner
28) 8) dialog: Ahhh... your quest... chingaso...
28) 10) dialog: He may be a soulless robot but he's a rich, happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who's got you by the huevos -- (beat)
28) 13) dialog: But you are who she thinks you are! Look, I don't bet on a horse with a hard-on.
28) 16) dialog: (embarrassed)
28) 17) text: Hey, hey... shit... cool it... 39   Suddenly a convertible passes -- Simms and Molly, laughing, carefree, enjoying each other. The couple in the car doesn't see Tin Cup grabbing his crotch making a fool of himself on the sidewalk -- but Tin Cup and Romeo see them.
30) 0) text: Tin Cup hangs up the phone and turns to Romeo.
30) 2) dialog: Maybe you should treat her more like a lady.
30) 4) dialog: She did that after you let her dump you. It wouldn't kill you just once to tell her she's beautiful, she can dance, she's
30) 6) text: Romeo... are you sweet on Doreen? ROMEO
30) 8) text: Great, Romeo, just great... just when I need you to be my friend and coach, you go get all gooey about one of my ex-girlfriends who just happens to be our boss. ROMEO
30) 11) text: Women are tougher to figure out than a feathered one iron from a tight lie -- Suddenly a golf image relaxes them into their comfort zone. ROMEO
30) 13) text: Shut up, Romeo... I wasn't really seeking golf tips... ROMEO
30) 15) text: How far off the back foot? ROMEO
30) 19) dialog: I'm no expert, but it seems to me that the `pursuit of a person's mythic destiny' is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a five dollar an hour job in order to do...
30) 23) dialog: You don't know no shrinks.
30) 25) dialog: Not the doctor lady?
30) 27) dialog: You can't ask advice about the woman you're trying to hose from the woman you're trying to hose!
34) 6) text: If she was a par three, I'd'a made a nine. ROMEO
34) 9) text: Dollar bills... Romeo backs off to let the man practice, and Clint asks: CLINT
34) 10) text: What's he saying? ROMEO
37) 21) text: I can help you with the mental aspects of the game. You've got Romeo to be your swing doctor, I can be your head doctor. TIN CUP
38) 2) dialog: How ya feelin', boss?
38) 4) dialog: Jesus, the doctor lady's here --
38) 7) dialog: Long as you keep your dick out of it --
38) 9) dialog: The Big Dog'll eat?
38) 14) text: I just have to help him keep his head on straight -- ROMEO
38) 16) text: He does have the occasional tendency towards self-destruction it seems. ROMEO
38) 20) text: Got my 'A' game with me today, folks... you're in for a real treat! Molly leans to Romeo just before they all head down the fairway and confides -- MOLLY
38) 23) dialog: Good. 'Cause it's his best side... And they head down the fairway, a scruffy little gallery on a so-so course. With a lot at stake...
39) 0) text: Tin Cup's in a zone, talking to himself, full of himself, in a fabulous, indomitable state of mind. Molly and Romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging, Tin Cup's on a roll and needs no help. So far... A couple of the regulars shout out encouragement.
39) 2) dialog: They bugging you, boss -- I can shut 'em up?
39) 5) text: Gimme the lumber. But Romeo is handing him a two iron. ROMEO
39) 7) text: I said I want the Big Dog. Romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg left par five. ROMEO
39) 9) text: I'm not going left of those trees. I'm going over those trees... with a little draw. That way I get home in two. That way I'm putting for eagle. ROMEO
39) 11) text: Qualify? I want the course record! Now gimme the lumber! Tin Cup reaches for the driver.   Romeo shifts the golf bag beyond Tin Cup's reach. ROMEO
39) 13) text: I think I'm gonna get penalized for slow play if you don't give me that fucking driver. ROMEO
39) 18) text: Trust your feelings, Roy. TIN CUP (to Romeo)
39) 19) text: Ha!   Gimme the driver and shut up. Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over his knee. He tosses the two halves on the ground near Tin Cup. ROMEO
39) 20) text: ... Go ahead.    Hit the driver. Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing his anger, not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a reaction. TIN CUP
39) 21) text: I changed my mind. Gimme the three wood. ROMEO
39) 23) text: Wanna bet? Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it     over his kne and tosses the halves on the ground next     to the drive halves. Tin Cup turns with amusement to      his playing partners, lest they think management has     lost the upp hand with labor. TIN CUP
39) 26) text: Sometimes I fan that two iron. Better gimme the three. Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron.    Tin Cup loo at it, frowns, then: He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground. Molly leans over to the regulars. MOLLY
39) 29) text: Sometimes I catch that three a little thin... He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven iron from his bag. He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire. TIN CUP
39) 41) dialog: No, boss, I'm tired... my life's too short to spend it watching you fall apart. I done it too many times. Romeo turns and starts walking away.
45) 0) text: Tin Cup drives, as most of the Regulars lounge -- all are there including Turk (the bouncer). But Romeo is missing.
49) 0) text: Tin Cup arrives, fresh from the qualifier.   Romeo is shafting glubs.
49) 3) text: Earl gave me a straight read -- the thing broke half a dozen times -- missed ya, pods! Romeo gives him the silent treatment.
49) 5) text: It's a little late to be pissed off! We're in the Open! You and me! Still nothing from Romeo.
49) 8) dialog: I knew you had the hots for her.
49) 10) dialog: Well, I don't think her nor me nor the God of Golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the Open...
49) 14) text: You're complaining again! Romeo's back! Whining, bitching, pissed off -- you're my man! Silence.   Some chagrin. ROMEO
49) 17) text: I carried my bag the last four holes. I love ol' Earl but I need you. ROMEO
49) 19) text: I love you, too, God damn it! ROMEO
49) 23) dialog: Am I special? TIN CUP
49) 24) text: If you can remove the sexual connotations and overlay a golf theme, Romeo -- I am your Juliet. Romeo ponders it all. ROMEO
49) 30) dialog: You got it bad, don't ya?
49) 33) dialog: Be sure to do that in the Open. Unfazed, Tin Cup steps up to hit again, but... once more -- Thwock! -- Another horrible-looking squib to the right. Romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching Tin Cup. Thwock, thwock! -- Something's terribly wrong.
49) 37) dialog: I'm watching.
49) 39) dialog: Yeah, boss, you got the 'S' word.
49) 41) dialog: Shanks are like a virus -- they just show up. Nobody can figure 'em out. Thwock, thwock, thwock! -- Three more chili dippers.   Ou man definitely has the shanks. And he's panicking.
49) 43) dialog: It's the woman.
49) 45) dialog: A woman can have the same effect.
49) 47) dialog: Keep swinging...
50) 9) text: He's in one of his pleasant moods, I see -- ROMEO
50) 24) text: You expect me to pack that around? ROMEO
50) 37) text: What happened to your confidence? ROMEO
50) 39) text: Must be true love. ROMEO
50) 50) dialog: You want me to stay, boss?
50) 52) dialog: You got it. And Romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the lot. And as they drive away, Tin Cup sits down, his head in his hands.
52) 16) text: So it's in Romeo's department? TIN CUP
55) 0) text: The intrepid Winnebago on the way to the Open.    Romeo drives -- Tin Cup stares out the window.
55) 1) dialog: You got to relax, boss --
55) 3) dialog: I'm gonna get rid of them shanks for ya. No hay problema.
55) 5) dialog: She the enemy, boss.
55) 8) dialog: Well she wakin' up with the enemy -- same thing.
55) 11) dialog: I don't know, boss, I just don't know. And Tin Cup puts on his Walkman, and stares out the window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery, to the MUSIC of GEORGE JONES...
59) 0) text: Romeo and Tin Cup stare out into the trees, the lushness -- a couple of wide-eyed kids.
59) 4) text: Yes? ROMEO
59) 6) text: Who's that? Mr. Crenshaw? That you? Mr. Price, Mr. Norman? No? Tin Cup leans across Romeo to introduce himself. TIN CUP
59) 8) text: Do we have a... McCormack... on the list. ROMEO
59) 10) text: We got over 150 legends in this tournament. Sorry. Romeo starts cursing in Spanish.   The Guard is unphased. SECURITY GUARD
59) 11) text: Call the police. ROMEO
60) 0) text: Lots of the big names are there.   Romeo is like a kid at the ballpark.
60) 1) dialog: Look! Right there! Fred Couples... and Ray Floyd! Romeo notices that Tin Cup is staring at the pile of practice balls lying there on the tee.
60) 4) dialog: You think it would be inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for an autograph?
60) 6) dialog: Hit the seven iron. You never miss the seven...
60) 10) text: Who hit that shot? Anybody see? He addresses another one.   And swings. THWOCK!   A disaster.   He crumbles. ROMEO
60) 12) text: A little fucking thin?! I still got the shanks! Everybody's watching! Christ, Simms is here... Simms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as he loosens up. ROMEO
60) 15) text: What's the problem? I'm catching it on the hosel, right? Moving my head? I'm laying off it, I'm pronating, I'm supinating, I'm clearing too early, I'm clearing too late, I'm off plane, I ain't dropping in -- oh, God, my swing feels like an unfolding lawn chair. ROMEO
60) 18) text: Anything.   Kill me now! ROMEO
60) 19) text: Put all your change in your right pocket. Tin Cup follows orders, not questioning the logic. ROMEO
60) 20) text: Very good. Now tie your left shoelace in a double knot. Again, Tin Cup dutifully follows orders. ROMEO
60) 22) text: I'll look like a fool. ROMEO
60) 24) text: Okay, okay... ROMEO
60) 26) text: How'd I do that? ROMEO
60) 30) dialog: You cured.
60) 32) dialog: That's it. Your brain was getting in the way.
60) 34) dialog: Well, I should recommend you go work on your short game but I think it's better if you go get drunk instead.
60) 36) dialog: Yeah. You always play better when you're wasted. Tin Cups stares at the swami, and --
61) 0) text: Again to GEORGE JONES on the CASSETTE PLAYER, Tin Cup is doing a slow dance with his driver. Romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink after drink for Tin Cup, who's thoroughly plastered.
61) 2) dialog: Seven-o-five... first group off... Keep drinking, keep dancing...
61) 4) dialog: You're drinking till five... c'mon, c'mon, have another -- (a tough coach)
61) 7) dialog: Nothing like the sight of a finely-tuned athlete on the verge of greatness... Romeo tosses a blanket over Tin Cup lying on the floor.
62) 4) dialog: Almost missed the starting time trying to get you off the floor, boss. You don't handle the hooch like you used to... Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried practice swings. The early tee times are strictly for the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around. Tin Cup's hand shakes as he closes the Velcro flap on his glove. He's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-on patches, as he stares down the first fairway. Romeo hands him a driver.
62) 6) dialog: I seen this hole on TV. Hit the big dog down the chute --
62) 8) dialog: You sure?
63) 1) dialog: Eighty-three.    Well, you humble now.
63) 3) dialog: You weren't trying to make threes. You were trying to avoid making thirteen.
63) 5) dialog: Maybe that was a coaching error on my part.
64) 6) dialog: Ol' Anti-Christ got a hot putter...
64) 10) dialog: Easy, boss...
66) 28) text: This is ridiculous... But Romeo's sizing it up. ROMEO
66) 32) text: Roy? Tin Cup still sits, head half buried at the bar. He's never passed up such an opportunity, but he's pretty low. ROMEO
66) 42) dialog: Fore in the grill! Fore on the patio! You're the legend, boss... Tin Cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to Molly.
66) 47) dialog: Stiff, baby, stiff!
67) 0) text: Pouring rain -- Lightning and THUNDERSTORMS.   It pours down on the club and the beat-up RV. Romeo stands outside with an umbrella, dragging on a cigarette, trying to stay warm.
68) 11) dialog: You guys done yet? This is no time for a marathon... The rain keeps coming down.
74) 0) text: Tin Cup and Romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green. A shot similar to the one he pulled off at the best-ball.
74) 1) dialog: Two-sixty to carry, Roy. You got to lay up, man. I don't care how good you swinging. You got to lay
75) 5) dialog: Carry, honey!    Please!   Carry!
75) 10) dialog: Up an' down...
77) 0) text: Tin Cup, Molly, Romeo all asleep -- In the same bed.
80) 0) text: Romeo palms the seven iron, waiting for Tin Cup to decide on his play.
80) 2) dialog: There's wind up there.
82) 7) dialog: Roy...
82) 9) dialog: It's a water hazard. You go up there and take a drop. Try to save par like you did yesterday. Tin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get through to him.
85) 0) text: Tin Cup, Molly and Romeo study the menu.
85) 3) dialog: Plus he needs his carbohydrates --
85) 5) text: If the boys from Salome was in town -- this is where they'd be... The boys from Salome walk in -- with Doreen, all looking like hell from the long bus trip. They're ecstatic to see Tin Cup and Romeo. CLINT
85) 10) text: We're home now! ROMEO
85) 26) dialog: You're looking particularly lovely this evening... the coif is extraordinary.
87) 0) text: Tin Cup slips out of the trailer -- Romeo follows.
88) 0) text: Tin Cup hitting golf balls alone, except for the faith- ful Romeo, getting ready for the final round of the U.S. Open.
91) 6) dialog: I bet you a hundred.
92) 1) dialog: Which way you going? Tin Cup points over the trees.   Romeo grimaces.   Tin Cu addresses the shot. Then: Tin Cup swings -- the ball flutters weakly out of the rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree, dropping eventually next to its trunk, and:
111) 0) text: Tin Cup and Romeo watch Jacobsen hit his shot.
112) 5) dialog: Then you got to lay up. Simms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landing a little short of Roy's.
113) 5) dialog: (whispering)
113) 8) text: You know something, Romeo? Eagle puts me ten under. No one's ever finished an Open ten under, not even Nicklaus. ROMEO
113) 10) text: This is everything, ain't it? This is the choice it comes down to. This is our immortality... ROMEO
115) 8) dialog: She's right, Pods, a drop and a stroke, up and down par -- we'll win it in sudden death. But Tin Cup still has the look of eagles. He's staring at the shot he just made, still holding the three wood.
115) 10) dialog: Helluva move you put on that sucker, now let's get up there, take the drop, and make our par, tie Peter...
115) 12) dialog: Not now.
118) 2) dialog: This is your last ball, man. If this gets wet, you disqualified.
123) 0) text: Romeo and Doreen eye each other -- locked in a stare of longing and mystery. TANGO MUSIC comes from a BOOM BOX. They begin to move toward each other in a tango step.
