7) 10) dialog: Cut the horseshit, guys. So... the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always breaks slow, so I figure there's gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at the turn and the three dog's gonna tiptoe around it and walk on home... I was right. (smiles)
7) 14) text: I know you're going to pay me. DOREEN (CONT'D)
7) 17) text: There. With equity and inventory it's worth twelve grand... more or less. Doreen leans forward to examine the papers.    She looks Tin Cup with surprise. DOREEN
7) 19) text: Only on condition you don't sell right away, and me'n Romeo keep our jobs. DOREEN
7) 21) text: Equity, inventory, cash flow... not to mention an enhanced stature in the community, and prepaid membership in the Salome Chamber of Commerce. For a moment, Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup, caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. Then she starts to consider the idea more seriously. DOREEN
7) 26) dialog: What do you pay yourself?
7) 28) dialog: To hit golf balls all day... when you're not breaking for beers or corn dogs or to gather the guys and lay bets on which crow flies off the fence next.
7) 30) dialog: I'm referring to every nickel you snatch out of the till and every bag of beer nuts you lift from the rack, is what I'm referring to. (beat)

19) 4) text: It's a business proposition. I'm offering you my winnings from all them tournaments this summer. DOREEN
19) 6) text: My driving range back. She dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea. She dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition, and moves her face opposite his. DOREEN
19) 9) text: Now wait, Doreen. You gotta do the math, and you gotta look at how good I'm playing. I hit the shot of the tournament at the best-ball. They put it on national TV. DOREEN
19) 12) text: (shouting) And what does that tell you? DOREEN
29) 0) text: Doreen's on the phone, between shows, and is adamant.

43) 0) text: A nearly nude dancer named SAMMANTHA on stage to a big Saturday night crowd. Tin Cup's in the front row, sitting with Doreen and a beer. Disconsolate.
43) 7) text: I broke my clubs -- don't ask why, my caddie's pissed off at me, I lost my wheels in a sucker bet, and my shrink thinks I'm a fool -- 'cause I probably am... DOREEN
43) 9) text: Yeah, what's wrong with that? DOREEN

43) 15) text: McAvoy?   The Tin Cup McAvoy? DOREEN
43) 19) text: No, but I'd sure like to show you my grip... Doreen can't keep his attention. Neither can Sammantha, who writhes only a few feet away. DOREEN
43) 24) text: See that? Tin Cup McAvoy says you grip a golf club like this, with these two fingers. DOREEN
43) 28) text: When you're done with him, can I ask you about my club position at address? Sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though she's down to a G-string, inches away. At the height of the MUSIC, she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen --
43) 31) dialog: No, honey, you ain't -- but a healthy woman's only got two choices in this world of ours... (beat)
43) 32) text: Either fall in love with another woman -- or take up golf. And Doreen heads to the dressing room, disgusted, but not at all surprised. She knows Tin Cup -- she knows men.
50) 7) dialog: Hiya, fellas! TIN CUP
50) 8) text: What is this? Everybody like to watch a train wreck?! Doreen approaches the regulars, and we notice for the first time that there are a number of bags and packages with the boys. DOREEN
50) 10) text: He's got the shanks. We got the makings of a Greek tragedy here. DOREEN
50) 13) text: Unless it's a 'swing thought,' I'm not interested... DOREEN
50) 17) text: But I got the shanks -- DOREEN
50) 19) text: Is it really that obvious? DOREEN
50) 22) text: Awright, awright... She unwraps a tour golf bag -- Big gold and red lettering advertises "The Golden Tassel." Pastie tassels hang from all over the bag. Doreen sets it down proudly. DOREEN
50) 25) text: I'm carrying the bag. DOREEN
50) 32) text: And since I couldn't get the post office to come aboard, me and my girl friend Muriel's gonna buy a fan club patch you can put anywhere you want. Doreen and the regulars look at Tin Cup proudly. TIN CUP
50) 34) text: This shit is us, man.   You can't win without us. DOREEN
50) 36) text: Hell, I won't even make the cut! DOREEN
50) 38) text: He's shanking his love life so he's shanking the golf ball. DOREEN
50) 48) dialog: (to the regulars)
50) 49) text: He's trying to talk to God.   It's time for us to go. Doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave Tin Cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly, his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence.
72) 0) text: Doreen is behind the till. The regulars and several customers crowd the counter, staring up at the TELEVISION as Dewey rushes in from his job.

85) 11) text: You boys a sight for sore eyes. We so damn sick of guys in blazers and slacks that don't wrinkle. It ain't natural 'round here... DOREEN
85) 13) text: Doreen, meet Dr. Griswold... er, Molly... my shrink -- MOLLY
85) 14) text: Ex-shrink. (matter-of-factly) We're sleeping together now so I can't be his therapist. DOREEN
85) 16) text: Knew what? DOREEN
85) 27) dialog: Why thank you... Romeo.
94) 0) text: Molly and Doreen stand together behind the big gallery. Molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the gallery to the green. Doreen is on her tip-toes but all she can see are the backs of heads. A swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans.
94) 3) dialog: He played catcher on the high school baseball team. The star pitcher had this big-league curve, and not all his pitches hit Roy in the mitt. Finally, you gotta respect a man's doggedness. You know? (beat)
94) 4) text: The team decided Tin Cup sounded better than Clank. Molly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands it to Doreen.
94) 8) dialog: Tell me something, Molly... have you ever had a Latin lover?
102) 0) text: Molly and Doreen watch Tin Cup drain a putt.
102) 3) dialog: You ever dated a guy who actually believes in soul mates?

113) 11) text: No time to be thinkin' 'immortality,' Cup... time to be thinkin' 7 iron. Molly stands with Doreen, hearing Tin Cup's words. Thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself nodding. Doreen, on the other is turning ash-white. DOREEN
113) 13) text: Go for it! DOREEN
113) 15) text: Go for it, Roy! Knock it on! DOREEN
113) 19) dialog: Well, honey, he's your guy.

119) 7) dialog: You two are made for each other.
