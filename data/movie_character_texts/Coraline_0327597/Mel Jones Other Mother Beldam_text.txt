1) 6) dialog: (not listening) Uh huh.
1) 10) dialog: (continues typing) That's nice.

1) 43) dialog: What's his name, anyway?

8) 6) dialog: Fine.
8) 11) text: Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key. Holds it up.
8) 15) text: Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key in the lock. Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation, the doll at her side. Mel turns the key, unlocks the door, and pulls it open to reveal ... an UNBROKEN BRICK WALL. Coraline is totally disappointed.

23) 9) text: Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the windows.

23) 27) text: Mel CLEARS HER THROAT, interrupting.
23) 29) dialog: If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP.
23) 30) text: He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with Coraline.
23) 32) dialog: Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would love to hear your dream.
23) 36) dialog: 
24) 4) text: Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.
25) 21) text: She holds out his mail. Bobinsky takes it, smelling the stinky envelopes deeply. Nods approvingly.
25) 41) text: He smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems to fall off the side of the third story porch! Coraline rushes over, looks down. He cartwheels in from the porch railing behind her.
40) 11) dialog: (indicates neck brace) Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new catalog. At least, they'll love my chapters.
40) 12) text: Gives her an "aren't you funny" look, opens door. Mel looks back at Coraline.

42) 5) dialog: I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters.
42) 9) dialog: (shorter than previous) Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer.
42) 13) dialog: Your school might be fun.
42) 17) dialog: Had to give it a try.
43) 1) text: Mel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas from the fridge.
43) 3) dialog: How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch?
43) 8) dialog: Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special.
43) 13) dialog: 
43) 18) text: Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl pulls away.
43) 20) dialog: Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up.
43) 25) dialog: Won't be long.
76) 4) text: They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U S. В­ her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL, SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her parents. The image fades.

94) 31) dialog: Well, get yourself cleaned up,
94) 39) dialog: Of course! What else?
94) 43) text: But the snow melts without a trace.
94) 45) dialog: 
95) 20) dialog: Even Bobinsky?
95) 26) text: As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so" look, and she and Charlie leave the room.
