0) 18) text: ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN. STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.
0) 19) text: UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS, Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret- lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!
0) 21) dialog: (freaked out) AHHHHH!
0) 24) dialog: GET AWAY FROM ME--

0) 53) text: Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the covering.

0) 117) text: She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE. Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery "plop" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her.
1) 1) text: It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins, squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill. She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one hand.
1) 2) text: The main floor kitchen, like most   things in the Pink Palace, is barely maintained, and   looks worn and faded. Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,   bangs away at her laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES   stacked nearby. She's plain-looking and tired and wears   a NECK-BRACE.
1) 4) dialog: I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
1) 8) dialog: I would have died.
1) 11) text: Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.
1) 13) dialog: Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening.
1) 16) text: Coraline turns to her.
1) 18) dialog: But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here?
1) 22) dialog: Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
1) 26) dialog: 
1) 32) dialog: That sounds exciting.
1) 35) text: Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE. Attached note reads:
1) 38) text: She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head credits - it's a litte Coraline!
1) 40) dialog: (to herself) Huh... a little me? That's weird.
1) 45) dialog: Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.
1) 46) text: But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room.
2) 1) text: CHARLIE Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning dark hair, HUNT-AND-PECKS at his ancient computer, surrounded by boxes of GARDENING MAGAZINES and empty coffee cups. Coraline, with doll, opens the SQUEAKY DOOR. He doesn't turn.
2) 3) dialog: Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?
2) 8) dialog: D'you know where the garden tools are?
2) 13) dialog: Humph, it's just raining.
2) 17) dialog: 
2) 21) text: Coraline GROANS, stamps her feet. Charlie just taps harder on the keys. Pouting, she makes the door squeak, opening and shutting it till he can't take any more. He spins around.
2) 25) dialog: So?
2) 38) text: Coraline, with doll, jumps on BUMP in carpet that moves with each jump.
2) 44) text: Coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the stairs.
2) 47) text: A FRAMED PHOTO sits in the foreground on a beside table. It shows a younger, happier Coraline with her parents by the BEAR FOUNTAIN at the Detroit Zoo. RACK FOCUS to bedroom door as it swings into the room, with Coraline hanging on it. She drops to the ground and, doll and pad in hand, decides to check out the bathroom.
2) 50) dialog: Ewww!
2) 54) dialog: Ahh!!
2) 58) text: Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate.
2) 61) text: ANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it that says: Do not turn off!
4) 3) text: Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the closet and --
5) 2) text: Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open moving box and smiles.
5) 4) text: Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and adds to her list, muttering aloud.
5) 6) dialog: One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors...
5) 9) dialog: All right, little me, where are you hiding?
5) 13) dialog: Huh?
5) 16) dialog: Hey Mom...
6) 3) dialog: Where does this door go?
6) 8) text: Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle.
6) 10) dialog: I think it's locked.
7) 2) dialog: Pleeeeeeeeease!
8) 1) text: She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the door in the ratty old wallpaper.
8) 4) text: Coraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog.
8) 15) text: Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key in the lock. Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation, the doll at her side. Mel turns the key, unlocks the door, and pulls it open to reveal ... an UNBROKEN BRICK WALL. Coraline is totally disappointed.
8) 17) dialog: Bricks? I don't get it.
8) 18) text: Coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance.
8) 23) dialog: You're kidding? And why is the door so small?
8) 27) text: She exits. Coraline makes annoyed sound.
8) 29) dialog: You didn't lock it.
8) 32) text: Coraline pushes the little door shut, her head lowered.
9) 1) text: WIDE ANGLE ON HOUSE. Pouring rain. We hear Charlie singing a song about Coraline, badly.
10) 1) text: CHARLIE, using OVEN MITT to protect his hand, takes a BURNED-UP CASSEROLE DISH from the oven while mom closes up her LAPTOP. Coraline sits at the table with her doll.
10) 7) text: Coraline pushes it away, disgusted.
10) 9) dialog: Why don't you ever cook, Mom?
10) 12) text: Coraline HUFFS.
10) 16) dialog: Looks more like slime to me.
10) 19) text: Coraline looks to her doll, cradles its head.
10) 21) dialog: Think they're trying to poison me?
10) 22) text: She makes the doll's head nod "yes." Coraline rolls her eyes, looks up to the heavens and --
11) 1) text: -- falls back, washed and dressed for bed, on her pillow. Still raining out. Coraline puts the doll on the chair beside her, then scratches at her wrist. ORIGAMI DRAGONFLIES are strung between the tall, thin bed posts; the TURTLE SHELL she found in the garden sits up on a box, her NIGHT LAMP that projects stars and moons is warming up on the bedside table. Despite her efforts at decorating, Coraline's new bedroom feels small and cold, cracked and faded.
11) 2) text: Coraline reaches for a framed PHOTO that rests on a toy PRAYING MANTIS by her night lamp.
11) 3) text: It's her TWO BEST FRIENDS from home, posing in the snow by her old school's marquee, its letters rearranged to spell "CORALINE, GOOD BYE!" She touches her friends' faces with her fingertips.
11) 5) dialog: Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?
11) 8) dialog: Good-night...little me.
12) 2) text: SOMETHING in the room goes t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up, awake. SOMETHING CHITTERS under her bed. She leans over her bedside, head first, peering underneath when a ghost- pale KANGAROO MOUSE JUMPS OUT and bounds out the door.
14) 1) text: Coraline enters. The mouse edges out from beneath the sofa, then hops frantically toward the SMALL DOOR behind the wallpaper! Coraline runs and dives, but the door is open a crack, and the mouse escapes.
14) 2) text: Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open. Instead of a brick wall, there is a DARK, EXPANDING TUNNEL, with the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the far end.
14) 4) dialog: Whoa...
15) 1) text: Coraline MOVES FORWARD, towards the light ahead.
16) 1) text: Coraline steps out through the same little door, into what looks like the EXACT SAME LIVING ROOM she just left, only something is different -- it feels deeper, more dimensional.
16) 3) dialog: Huh?
16) 7) dialog: MMMMM, something smells good.
17) 1) text: Coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove, wearing an apron and ROOSTER-HEAD OVEN MITTS. The light and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect in this kitchen. Other Mother is facing away from Coraline as she works.
17) 3) dialog: Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night?
17) 4) text: Her mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline is DUMBSTRUCK: she's got BUTTONS FOR EYES! She beams with happiness at Coraline's arrival.
17) 8) dialog: You're not my mother.
17) 10) dialog: My mother doesn't have b-b-buh...
17) 11) text: Coraline points to her own eye.
17) 17) text: She opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of great cooking fills the air. Coraline breathes it in, suddenly VERY HUNGRY.
18) 1) text: Coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door.
19) 3) dialog: Hello?
19) 8) dialog: My father can't play piano.
19) 14) text: Coraline is amazed as his hands fly.
19) 19) dialog: I, uh В­ sorry В­ but she said to tell you the food's ready.
20) 1) text: Other Mother sets down a HUGE, ROASTED CHICKEN near Coraline on a table spread with CANDLES, fine CHINA and SILVER and a PINEAPPLE CENTERPIECE. FIGURE EIGHT MODEL TRAIN TRACKS circle twin LAZY SUSANS covered in dishes of POTATOES, SWEET PEAS, ROLLS, and CORN. The Other Father seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making PRAYER HANDS and a solemn face.
20) 4) text: He laughs with glee then a STARTING BELL rings and it's time to eat. Other Father really digs in while Coraline tries some chicken.
20) 6) dialog: Mmmm, this chicken is good.
20) 10) dialog: (nodding, mouth full) D'you have any gravy?
20) 13) text: Other Mother GIGGLES as a MODEL TRAIN circles round the track, pulling a GRAVY BOAT CAR and blowing its whistle. The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with Coraline's plate, where it POURS GRAVY on her potatoes.
20) 18) dialog: (mouth full) I'm real thirsty.
20) 23) dialog: Mango milk shake?
20) 24) text: The dispenser SPINS, stops and fills her glass while Other Mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that POP UP and LIGHT THEMSELVES while the words "WELCOME HOME!" write themselves in icing. Coraline is taken aback.
20) 26) dialog: Home?
20) 31) dialog: For me?
20) 34) text: Coraline remains a little unsure.
20) 36) dialog: I didn't know I had an Other Mother.
20) 39) text: She smiles at Coraline, her button eyes gleaming.
20) 41) dialog: Really?
20) 46) dialog: 
20) 51) dialog: What rain?
20) 54) dialog: Huh, what about the mud?
20) 57) text: Other Mother rises, walks towards Coraline.
20) 60) text: The takes Coraline's rashy hand, but Coraline pulls it away.
20) 62) dialog: 
20) 64) text: Coraline adjusts her tone.
20) 66) dialog: I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get home to my other mother.
20) 70) dialog: 
20) 76) dialog: (shakes head) But ...
21) 1) text: In this world, Coraline's bedroom is a dream come true: it is filled with rich color and light; there's a fire in the fireplace, a sheer, lacy canopy over her now beautiful bed. And her favorite toys are alive!
21) 3) dialog: Wow.
21) 11) dialog: Hello.
21) 21) dialog: Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right?
21) 28) text: Coraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns, stretching out her arms.
21) 29) text: The Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand and applies some SOOTHING BLACK MUD to Coraline's poison oak rash.
21) 31) dialog: Oh, the mud...
21) 32) text: The Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to sleep.
22) 1) text: Coraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM: moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed.
22) 4) dialog: 
23) 1) text: Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was only a dream.
23) 3) dialog: 
23) 9) text: Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the windows.
23) 11) dialog: It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother.
23) 16) dialog: You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers.
23) 30) text: He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with Coraline.
23) 34) dialog: Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats.
23) 38) text: Coraline sighs, gets up to go.
24) 1) text: It's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house and grounds. Coraline В­ yellow rain poncho, garden SHEAR in hand В­ opens the front door. Stepping out onto the porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes.
24) 3) dialog: Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...
24) 6) dialog: Ohh, Poo-eeeee!
25) 3) dialog: H-hello?...
25) 6) dialog: I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I leave it outside or...
25) 7) text: The door swings open. Curious, Coraline peeks inside: it's dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove and a caged chicken.
25) 9) dialog: Hmmm...
25) 19) dialog: 
25) 26) dialog: Huh?
25) 29) text: He swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her on the balcony. Coraline backs away.
25) 33) dialog: Meeshkas?
25) 37) dialog: Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.
25) 41) text: He smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems to fall off the side of the third story porch! Coraline rushes over, looks down. He cartwheels in from the porch railing behind her.
25) 47) text: He scuttles inside and slams the door shut. Coraline mutters.
25) 49) dialog: Cor-a-line.
25) 56) dialog: (to herself) Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot.
25) 61) dialog: No!!!
25) 66) dialog: The...jumping mice?
25) 70) text: Coraline is startled.
25) 72) dialog: The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up.
25) 82) text: Coraline stares after him.
26) 1) text: SHEARS IN HAND, Coraline approaches the family VW, where one PINK SUITCASE remains tied to the roof. She snips it free and takes out her special HAT, a black Japanese schoolboy's cap.
27) 1) text: Coraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat. At the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it reads "No whistling in the house."
27) 2) text: She peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS SPINK В­ wearing some sort of house robe В­ opens the doo and three SCOTTIE DOGS В­ HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS В­ shoo out and surround Coraline. Spink tries to quiet them down.
27) 7) dialog: Still Coraline, Miss Spink.
27) 12) text: Miss Spink leads Coraline into the living area, as MISS FORCIBLE, taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very large bosom, prepares tea in the kitchen to the side. The dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa. Coraline scans the walls to see framed POSTERS from the "Shakespeare" the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius Seize Her. Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind without her glasses.
27) 26) text: The dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase filled with STUFFED SCOTTY DOGS IN KNITTED SWEATERS WITH ANGEL WINGS.
27) 28) dialog: 
27) 37) text: Miss Forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges Coraline to take a candy as Spink goes on and on.
27) 40) text: Coraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy is so old and sticky, her fingers get stuck. Then her other hand gets stuck, trying to get the first hand out.
27) 43) text: Coraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy bowl which FLIES UP and sticks to the ceiling.
27) 46) text: She turns to Coraline, about to sip her tea. Spink indicates cup.
27) 50) dialog: Read what?
27) 53) text: Coraline gulps down the bitter brew.
27) 56) text: Coraline passes her the cup. Spink puts a saucer on top and swirls it three times, removes the saucer and peers in at the abstract leaf pattern. She purses her lips.
27) 68) dialog: A what?
27) 74) text: Coraline wants more information.
27) 76) dialog: What do you see?
27) 91) text: Coraline asks in a practical voice:
27) 93) dialog: Well, what should I do?
27) 100) text: Coraline thinks it over, then shakes her head.
27) 102) dialog: No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though.
28) 1) text: Coraline climbs the stairs up to ground level, intrigued by her fortune.
28) 3) dialog: (to herself) Danger?
28) 4) text: Behind her, a PERISCOPE RISES from the WAIST-DEEP FOG. Coraline just catches it in her peripheral view.
28) 9) dialog: Great, the village stalker.
28) 14) dialog: What d'ya mean, "we?"
28) 17) dialog: Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss!
28) 22) dialog: 
28) 24) text: Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a tree and up onto the roof of the house. Coraline softens.
28) 26) dialog: So... that doll. Did you make it look like me?
28) 30) text: Coraline is highly skeptical. Wybie returns to his hunt.
28) 32) dialog: (points to self) C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?
28) 33) text: Wybie stands excitedly and presents a HUGE YELLOW-GREEN SLUG to Coraline.
28) 38) dialog: 
28) 44) dialog: I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either.
28) 50) dialog: Ew!
28) 51) text: Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful, then glances up past Coraline at the house. He SIGHS and speaks in a SAD TONE.
28) 55) dialog: 
28) 60) dialog: Dangerous?
28) 64) dialog: So?
28) 69) dialog: 
28) 71) text: ANGLE from roof, over CAT'S SHOULDER as dialog continues. Cat senses something and turns -- it's Coraline's DOLL AT THE WINDOW, looking like it's spying on things.
28) 73) dialog: Well, what do you think?
28) 87) dialog: Wait a minute!
28) 92) text: CU ON DOLL FACE, back in   the chair by the bed. Coraline takes some yellow cheese   from her pocket and puts it by the door: mice bait. She   lies down and her breathing slows, the doll watching   her with a nearly IMPERCEPTIBL SMILE on its face.
28) 96) text: Coraline sleeping, lighting suggests another dream. SOME THINGS go t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up, looks to her door, and spots a COUPLE OF KANGAROO MICE stealing the last bit of cheese.
30) 1) text: Coraline follows the kangaroo mice directly to the little door, opened a crack, where they disappear.
31) 1) text: Coraline enters Other Kitchen to find Other Mother preparing a delicious breakfast. She looks PRETTIER tonight; her black hair shining, lips REDDER. She stops HUMMING A LULLABY to greet Coraline.
31) 5) dialog: Hi.
31) 10) dialog: Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait...
31) 13) text: Beams at Coraline.
31) 17) dialog: You mean my Other Father?
31) 21) dialog: But my parents don't have time to garden.
31) 24) dialog: Mmmmmm!
31) 27) text: Coraline shrugs okay, starts for the door.
32) 1) text: Coraline opens the gate to the garden. A large CRESCENT MOON RISES, and THINGS START TO GROW.
32) 3) text: The hummingbirds circle around Coraline, light her DRAGONFLY BARRETTE, then continue on, LIGHTING UP PITCHER PLANTS that have grown up in a nearby flower bed. A beautiful FROG POKES OUT of one blossom.
32) 4) text: The birds lead Coraline up steps past a stone wall where BLEEDING HEART GROW, AND GLOW, AND BEAT.
32) 9) dialog: I love your garden!
32) 13) text: A gang of SNAP DRAGONS goes at her, TICKLING Coraline till she falls down. Her squeals of delight grow into HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.
32) 15) dialog: 
32) 22) text: Arriving beside Coraline, he waggles his finger at the naughty snapdragons.
32) 25) text: Then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to Coraline. She nods thanks.
32) 27) dialog: Well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food?
32) 30) text: She does. The Other Father grabs the GEARSHIFT KNOB, pulls it, and the mechanical mantis SPROUTS WINGS. They RISE in the air. Looking down, she sees that the garden is a PORTRAIT OF CORALINE.
32) 32) dialog: I can't believe you did this!
33) 1) text: Coraline doesn't hold back this time. She stacks sausages on eggs on top of waffles, rolls it up and stuffs it in her mouth. The Other Mother FEEDS BITS OF SAUSAGE to the HUNGRY SNAPDRAGONS bouquet now in a vase.
33) 3) dialog: Mmmm...so good!
33) 9) dialog: Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong.
33) 12) text: Coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while her Other Parents smile at one another.
33) 16) dialog: My friend?
33) 19) dialog: Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were- you-born.
33) 22) dialog: Hello?
33) 27) dialog: So he can't talk at all?
33) 32) dialog: Hmm, I like it.
33) 36) text: Coraline heads out the door with the mute boy.
34) 3) dialog: You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything.
34) 4) text: Other Wybie nods in agreement. Coraline and he start up the stairs to Bobinsky's.
34) 6) dialog: Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she...
34) 8) text: They run up the stairs and watch it slip through an opening above his door. Coraline knocks and the door suddenly SPINS, THROWING THEM INSIDE.
35) 3) dialog: Whoa... cool!
35) 4) text: Coraline goes right to the Ferris wheel where a MECHANICAL CHICKEN eats dried corn on the cob, fires up its belly, then POOPS OUT POPCORN into paper bags.
35) 5) text: Other Wybie stomps a firing button and COTTON CANDY shoots out of a cannon. He catches the cone, then starts firing off all the cannons. Coraline looks back to find him covered in the cotton candy.
35) 7) dialog: Look at you!
36) 5) dialog: 
36) 8) text: Coraline, grinning, turns to the Other Wybie.

81) 59) text: Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back.
81) 61) dialog: ...it's a deal--
81) 63) text: Coraline EXHALES, walks to the sink, stares at the dripping faucet.
81) 65) dialog: What does she mean "wonders?"
81) 68) dialog: Hmmm.
82) 1) text: Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas of glowing flowers.
82) 6) dialog: No!!
82) 7) text: They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE MOUTH.
82) 8) text: Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth.
82) 9) text: Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF.
82) 11) dialog: Stop!!
82) 12) text: Coraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out. She picks up the triangle candy.
82) 14) dialog: Why steal this?
82) 17) dialog: Wow...
82) 21) dialog: That must be it.
82) 23) text: HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice:
82) 26) text: Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the fountains as the tractor moves in.
82) 33) text: Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE WATER.
82) 34) text: Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD.
82) 35) text: Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary.
82) 39) dialog: Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it!
82) 40) text: Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale acid green.
82) 41) text: Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and Forcible's show song starts to play...
83) 1) text: CORALINE'S POV DOWN STAIRWAY: chaser lights circle the door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues.
83) 2) text: REVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM.
83) 6) text: WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the curtain open. Song stops.
83) 8) text: ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive, then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats. One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light and shivers.
83) 11) text: Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper, steels herself, then reaches inside. She touches something sticky and cold and inhuman. Clenching her teeth, she grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD, TAFFY HANDS - Young Spink and Forcible's.
83) 14) dialog: 
83) 20) text: Coraline PULLS AWAY, STRETCHING the candy arm out across the stage! The taffy monster THRUSTS OUT another paired arm, and starts DRAGGING ITSELF TOWARDS CORALINE, ropes swaying on pulleys.
83) 23) text: Coraline, desperate, gets an idea. She clicks on her flashlight and aims it at the BAT-DOGS. They GROWL with annoyance, OPEN their wings.
83) 24) text: The taffy monster is GETTING CLOSER! Coraline hurls the flashlight at the bat-dogs and HITS THEM. Angered, they TAKE WING TO ATTACK HER - just like she planned!
83) 27) text: BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE! Coraline's hand is released by the taffy hands, leaving her the PEARL. The bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as- stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and theater.
83) 28) text: The PEARL in Coraline's hand PULSES BLUE.
83) 31) text: Coraline nods, sticks the pearl in her bag, and looks up towards the ceiling and beyond.
84) 1) text: CORALINE'S MOVING POV, on lower ext stairs to UP ANGLE ON BALCONY. We hear haunting circus music in the air.
84) 3) text: ANGLE ON CORALINE as she climbs the last flight of stairs to Bobinsky's. She stops with a SHUDDER at the top. The flag has been replaced with the EMPTY COAT OF OTHER WYBIE gloves, pants and sneakers pinned on - hanging like old laundry.
84) 5) dialog: Oh, Wybie...
84) 8) dialog: EVIL WITCH ... I'M NOT SCARED!
84) 9) text: The door behind her CREAKS open. Coraline shivers - she is definitely scared.
85) 1) text: Coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the door. The cannons and Ferris wheel are dark and quiet; the circus tent glows dimly. Pale green moonlight shines in patches through holes in the roof. The corners and edges of the room are very dark.
85) 2) text: OTHER BOBINSKY suddenly CRAWLS by the door behind her. Coraline whips around, on guard. He LOOMS UP past the cannons on her right, leaning towards her.
85) 7) dialog: I'm Coraline.
85) 14) dialog: Uh-huh.
85) 18) text: Coraline holds up the triangle candy, scans the room for him. His voice sounds distorted now.
85) 22) text: WE SEE him twine up a post behind Coraline, crawl out on a beam...
85) 26) text: He SWINGS UPSIDE-DOWN from his ankles, his head stopping right by Coraline's. She whips around, alarmed.
85) 30) text: He DROPS to the floor on his head, then SLITHERS into the circus tent. Coraline does not want to follow him. But she does.
86) 4) text: Coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the AMBER GLOW coming from inside his hat.
86) 6) dialog: You don't get it, do you?
86) 12) dialog: Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.
86) 15) text: Coraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball. It barks at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar.
86) 16) text: RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around for the circus ball.
87) 2) text: Coraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE COTTON CANDY at her. She's HIT in the side, her leg, her ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like punches.
87) 4) dialog: Ahhh! No!!
87) 6) text: Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE.
87) 7) text: Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as hard as she can AT THE RAT.
89) 1) text: Coraline, lurching forward, HOLLERS.
89) 3) dialog: NOOOO!
90) 3) dialog: Noooo!
90) 4) text: The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment.
90) 5) text: WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost eye.
90) 6) text: Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light, turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the DARK BUTTON SHADOW.
90) 9) dialog: 
90) 13) text: There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up.
90) 17) text: Coraline smiles, walks towards him.
90) 19) dialog: I think you might have said something like that.
90) 22) text: He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline.
90) 25) dialog: Thank you.
90) 28) dialog: I'm heading inside. I still have to find my parents.
90) 32) text: ON CORALINE WITH CAT. A strange insect thrumming has begun. What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of paper are falling. Confused, she looks up to see:.
90) 34) text: UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE. The cat hisses. Deeply alarmed, they look from one direction to another.
90) 36) text: DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat, his TAIL TWITCHING. WE PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY
90) 38) text: NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the movie!
90) 39) text: Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her guardian angel.
90) 41) dialog: Come on, quickly!
91) 2) text: Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder, past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes, to the room where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on glass.
92) 2) text: Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign of her parents.
92) 3) text: ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground. She senses the Other Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at all but a witch, a Beldam. She turns.
92) 7) text: Her voice sounds dry and tired. She turns her face towards Coraline. It is a WHITE DEATH MASK, cracked and peeling - her true face.
92) 10) text: Coraline shudders and steps back. The cat makes a fearful sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.
92) 12) dialog: No, I ... I brought a friend.
92) 14) text: She reaches her long, sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to Coraline's face.
92) 18) text: Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.
92) 20) dialog: You, you have a very funny way of showing it.
92) 24) text: Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and starts to hand them over. But she catches herself.
92) 26) dialog: Hold on.
92) 29) dialog: We aren't finished yet, are we?
92) 33) text: She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and FLINGS it into the green fire. The Beldam laughs while the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops.
92) 34) text: ON CORALINE. The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT in her hand. Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.
92) 37) text: Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam to unlock it! She furrows her brow as an idea comes to her then nods.
92) 40) dialog: I already know where you've hidden them.
92) 44) text: Coraline points to the little door.
92) 46) dialog: They're behind that door.
92) 47) text: The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and speaks very quietly.
92) 50) text: A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way, as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.
92) 51) text: Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming from?!
92) 52) text: The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --
92) 56) text: C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back from them.
92) 58) dialog: 
92) 60) text: ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns to Coraline, expectantly.
92) 62) dialog: Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all right.
92) 64) text: She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song voice.
92) 68) text: ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat - obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's thinking very hard.
92) 72) text: She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the Beldam softly gloats:
92) 75) text: Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the fury she can.
92) 77) dialog: No ... I'm ...
92) 80) dialog: NOT!
92) 83) text: Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside, stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door from the other side.
92) 94) text: She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center. A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR!
92) 97) text: Coraline falls the very bottom of the web.
92) 99) text: Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS.
92) 103) text: Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room. She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM.
92) 107) text: Coraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS
93) 1) text: Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE.
93) 4) text: Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The cat takes off down the tunnel.
93) 5) text: Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN!
93) 7) dialog: PLEASE...SHUT!!
93) 8) text: The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED.
93) 9) text: The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the ground!
93) 11) text: Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped down, as fast as she can.
93) 15) text: And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side
94) 1) text: Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split- second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door and lock, hold. It's over...
94) 2) text: Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue with white clouds.
94) 6) text: As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe, Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY REAL MOTHER calls to her.
94) 11) dialog: Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!
94) 12) text: Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around them.
94) 15) text: C.U. ON CORALINE. Huh?
94) 20) dialog: I didn't break it. It must've broke when you escaped.
94) 28) dialog: BUT-
94) 35) text: Coraline, confused, takes a stab.
94) 37) dialog: You're talking about... your garden catalog?
94) 42) dialog: But look at the snow on your clothes...?
94) 47) text: Her parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room.
94) 53) text: The VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR Charlie make a strangled sound.
95) 1) text: Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED, wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night sky.
95) 2) text: Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the bed. Coraline LAUGHS.
95) 4) dialog: So, gonna order the tulips?
95) 9) dialog: For the garden party!!
95) 14) dialog: Dad!
95) 17) dialog: So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the invitations.
95) 22) dialog: Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's just...eccentric.
95) 26) text: As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so" look, and she and Charlie leave the room.
95) 27) text: Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window
95) 29) dialog: Oh, hello again.
95) 32) dialog: You still mad?
95) 35) dialog: I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the Other Mother? В­ it was all I could think of.
95) 37) text: Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and carries him over to her bed.
95) 40) dialog: I think it's time, don't you? To set them free?
96) 2) text: CAM TILT DOWN ON Coraline, studying sky, her back to us. From behind CAM, CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to shine on her. She turns toward us, shielding her eyes.
96) 3) text: Coraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE GHOST CHILDREN, now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS; EYES RESTORED, small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS.
96) 7) dialog: Well, I'm glad it's finally over!
96) 8) text: A SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children. They gather around Coraline and bow their heads.
96) 14) dialog: What about...me?
96) 19) text: Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation.
96) 21) dialog: But how?   I locked the door!?
96) 24) text: The KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out in front of Coraline. She grabs it.
96) 25) text: The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly.
96) 29) text: They begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and faster. Coraline starts to turn and then she --
97) 3) text: Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice
97) 6) dialog: I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s- somewhere she can never ...
97) 7) text: The cat doesn't like the sound of this. Coraline grabs her blanket and heads to her door. But the cat leaps down and blocks her way.
97) 9) dialog: Outta my way!
98) 1) text: Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads down the hall. She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits frame. CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.
99) 1) text: The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE. Through the narrow gap at the door's bottom, the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM CRAWLS OUT. It scrambles out of frame in the direction of Coraline!
99) 5) text: Coraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling.
99) 7) dialog: Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl, I think you are so nice ...
100) 3) dialog: ... I give you bowls of porridge And I give you bowls of ice cream.
100) 4) text: LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her.
100) 6) dialog: I give you lots of kisses, And I give you lots of hugs ...
101) 1) text: Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK.
101) 3) dialog: ... But I never give you sandwiches With grease and worms and mung beans.
101) 5) text: Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating, she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's around her neck.
101) 8) text: Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.
101) 9) text: The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!
101) 10) text: Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught between the key string and her neck!
101) 13) text: A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining electric bike!
101) 22) text: Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND. It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it. The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It crouches to attack her!
101) 24) text: Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing hard - removes the key and string from around her sore neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together with the string. The key is left attached.
101) 26) text: Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little with moonlight.
101) 29) text: Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath, stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the first time.
101) 31) dialog: Why did you change your mind?
101) 39) text: ANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE. Behind them, blossoms fall like snow in the orchard.
101) 41) dialog: The sweet ghost girl.
101) 49) dialog: Just bring her by the house tomorrow.      We can tell her together.
101) 53) dialog: You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me.
101) 57) text: The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS. Coraline smiles.
101) 65) text: Coraline picks up a TRAY OF DRINKS and heads out to her hard-working GUESTS, all wearing garden gloves and showing signs of having helped plant about TWO HUNDRED RED TULIPS.
101) 68) dialog: Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.
101) 72) dialog: Actually, it's just lemonade.
101) 73) text: Coraline hands them the beverages, then nods towards the GREY DOG digging in the flowers.
101) 75) dialog: How's Angus doing?
101) 79) text: Coraline heads up the steps to find her PARENTS dumping a heavy bag of PEAT MOSS around the dead-looking tree in the stone circle.

101) 100) text: Coraline, delighted, moves on.
101) 101) text: Coraline comes upon Bobinsky in the bottom of the drained fish pond. He's stealthily PULLING just-planted tulips from the dirt there, and putting BEETS in their place.

101) 106) dialog: How are the meeshkas, Mr. B?

101) 125) dialog: I'm Coraline Jones -- I've got so much to tell you!
