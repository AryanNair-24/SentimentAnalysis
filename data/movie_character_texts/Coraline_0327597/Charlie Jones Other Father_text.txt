5) 1) text: The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes, a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard mattress box leans against a corner wall.

9) 3) dialog: Oh, my twitchy witchy girl,
10) 1) text: CHARLIE, using OVEN MITT to protect his hand, takes a BURNED-UP CASSEROLE DISH from the oven while mom closes up her LAPTOP. Coraline sits at the table with her doll.

10) 18) dialog: Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot -- now what's it going to be?
23) 9) text: Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the windows.
23) 18) dialog: (pretend offense) Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.
23) 22) dialog:

94) 34) dialog: We gotta lot to celebrate!
94) 53) text: The VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR Charlie make a strangled sound.

95) 23) text: Charlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her.
95) 25) dialog: Good night, Coraline.
