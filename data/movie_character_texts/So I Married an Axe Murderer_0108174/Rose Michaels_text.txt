The rain is falling harder and harder. Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for life. He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips. She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harde and harder. Charlie now is nowhere near her. He then gets down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down th side of the drainpipe to get her. Rose looks up helplessly at him. Not really asking for hi help. Not denying it. She's accepted her fate. Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself  hanging on for dear life. He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd bel Charlie, then with all his strength -- his "where has thi strength been my whole life" strength -- pulls her up to roof next to him.
