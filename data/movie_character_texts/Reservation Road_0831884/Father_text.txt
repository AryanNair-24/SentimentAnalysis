69) 16) dialog: When they caught this guy, I was overjoyed. He was so stupid. He took his car to a repair shop and there was blood, my son’s blood, his hair, all over the radiator. The prosecutor told me we’re gonna put him away forever. I walk into the court and I see the prosecutor and this lawyer guy, expense suit, perfect teeth, talking, smiling. The prosecutor comes to me he says the defendant is willing to plea involutionary manslaughter. I said are you crazy. Then he tells me this murderer got himself a hot shot lawyer, and if we go in front of a jury we'll probably loose. Involuntary manslaughter. Six months in jail, three years probation, for murdering my only son. And now he’s out, in the fresh air, polluting it. I can barely breathe now, knowing his foul breath is mixed in. My wife’s fifty now, we have nobody, no children, no grandchildren, our family name all gone. We’re talking about adopting, but its not the same.
