21) 8) dialog: It’s a terrible thing, Mr. Learner, but I need your best recollection.
21) 10) dialog: What time would this have been?
21) 20) dialog: And the vehicle that hit your son came from the right? Ethan manages a nod. SERGEANT BURKE (CONT’D) Could you describe it for me?
21) 22) dialog: You get the make?
21) 24) dialog: Could you describe the driver? Ethan is frozen by his own uncertainty.

21) 31) dialog: I understand. We’1ll continue tomorrow. One of my guys will drive you home. But Ethan’s no longer listening. Lost in the nightmare of his own helplessness, staring at the body bag.
21) 33) dialog: I’m sorry Mr. Learner but need to keep the body here for now. It’s a crime scene. I’m going to make sure everything is handled with the greatest respect. You’ve got family to look after. Please go home. The word ‘body’ cuts Ethan like a sword.

35) 20) dialog: Look out maybe.
35) 22) dialog: No one else in the truck?
35) 24) dialog: Did you notice anything unusual about the vehicle, snow plough attachment, grill guard. Ethan shakes his head “no,” uncomfortable with his lack of memory.
35) 25) dialog: The reason I ask is that we usually find some debris from the impact: paint flakes, fiber glass, dirt the wheel well. There was none of that at the scene.
35) 27) dialog: We gathered up some items from around the scene, perhaps you could take a look. The first bag contains some crushed soda cans, empty cigarette pakcs.
