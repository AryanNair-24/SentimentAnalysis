7) 2) dialog: Andrea Sachs?
7) 3) text: (EMILY (and MIRANDA, later) pronounce ANDREA Ahn-DRAY-a. refers to herself as AN-dree-a.) ANDY turns and sees a taller, thinner and, amazingly, mor groomed CLACKER. This is EMILY. She looks the part of the sleek fashionista, but is propelled by a core of barely tamped down anxiety. She examines ANDY.
7) 4) dialog: Human Resources certainly has a bizarre sense of humor. (sigh, annoyed) Follow me.
8) 0) text: EMILY briskly walks ANDY down the hall.
8) 1) dialog: Okay, so... I was Miranda's second assistant, but her first assistant recently got promoted so now I'm the first...
8) 7) dialog: I'm trying. Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks. We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?
8) 9) dialog: (eyes widening) You didn't just ask me that. She's the editor in chief of Runway. Not to mention a legend. Work a year for her and you can get a job at any magazine you want. A million girls would kill for this job.
8) 11) text: She smiles. EMILY tries to think how to break it to her.
8) 12) dialog: Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine. An interest in fashion is crucial.
8) 14) text: EMILY gives her a look. ANDY smiles, like she has no idea what EMILY could mean. Suddenly, EMILY'S Blackberry goes off. She gasps.
8) 15) dialog: Oh my God. No. No, no, no.
10) 0) text: EMILY begins rapid-fire dialing four digit extensions.
10) 4) dialog: (all but screaming) She's on her way -- tell everyone!
10) 7) dialog: Her driver text-messaged. Her facialist ruptured a disk. God, these people!
10) 8) text: NIGEL turns and sees ANDY. Looks at EMILY. Who is that?
10) 9) dialog: I can't even talk about it.
14) 0) text: EMILY races to the kitchen (right near their bullpen). Ge glass, reaches into the fridge, pours a Pellegrino. Races into MIRANDA'S office. Races back out. Grabs an armful of magazines and newspaper from her desk and runs back into MIRANDA'S office.
16) 0) text: EMILY types frantically into her computer, presses print, stands by the printer waiting, takes the paper out of the printer, puts it on a clipboard. Notices ANDY.
16) 1) dialog: Oh no. You're still here. Go. ANDY gets up.
16) 2) dialog: No, stay. I don't want you walking past her. Just sit there and I'll pray she doesn't notice you marring the area. ANDY sits back down.
17) 0) text: ..until the moment MIRANDA enters the office from recepti Instantly, a quiet falls. Everyone looks calm and professional. Or fakes it. EMILY, phony smile on her face, trots down the hall to wa MIRANDA to her office.
17) 2) dialog: I'm so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm last night, but--
17) 4) text: MIRANDA gestures impatiently. EMILY hands her the clipboa MIRANDA peruses it as they walk down the hall.
17) 6) text: EMILY follows her.
17) 8) text: EMILY jots everything down.
17) 13) dialog: Right.
17) 15) text: MIRANDA stops at EMILY'S desk, takes off her coat, dumps on EMILY'S desk, walks past ANDY, seeming not to notice h
17) 17) text: Damn. Did notice her. EMILY follows MIRANDA.
18) 1) dialog: Nobody. Human resources sent her up about the assistant job and I was pre- interviewing her for you, but--
19) 0) text: EMILY walks out of MIRANDA'S office. Points at ANDY.
19) 1) dialog: She wants to see you.. Go go go....
19) 2) text: And before ANDY walks in, EMILY takes ANDY'S hideous briefcase and chucks it under a desk.
21) 1) dialog: Andrea! ANDY turns. And sees EMILY.
25) 0) text: EMILY is in the office.
25) 1) dialog: Miranda decided to kill the Autumn Jacket story for September -- she's pulling up the Sedona shoot from October. You need to go into the office right this second. Pick up her coffee order on the way. Write this down.
27) 1) dialog: Where are you?
29) 2) text: EMILY looks panicked.
30) 1) dialog: I hope you know this is a very difficult job for which you are totally wrong and if you mess up MY head is on the chopping block.
30) 2) text: EMILY takes the coffee, brings it into MIRANDA'S office, walks back out to her desk.
30) 3) dialog: Okay, first of all, you and I answer the phones. The phone MUST be answered every single time it rings.
30) 8) dialog: Phones roll to voicemail, she gets very upset. If I'm not here, you are chained to this desk.
30) 10) dialog: One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener. Miranda missed Lagerfeld right before he boarded a 17 hour flight to Australia. She now works at TV Guide.
30) 12) text: The phone RINGS. EMILY picks it up.
30) 13) dialog: Miranda Priestly's office. She's not available. I'll tell her you called. Yet again. (back to ANDY) Remember, you and I have totally different jobs. You run errands, you get coffee, etcetera. I am in charge of her schedule, her expenses, her appointments. And, most importantly... (big drumroll, she beams) I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.
30) 14) text: EMILY points to her Arc de Triomphe screensaver.
30) 15) dialog: (giddy) I get to wear couture, go to all the shows, all the parties, meet all the designers. It's divine. (sighs happily, then, abruptly)
30) 20) dialog: Okay, stay here. I'm going to the art department to give them the Book. EMILY shows ANDY a thick scrapbook.
30) 21) dialog: The Book is a mock-up of everything in the current issue. We deliver it to Miranda's apartment every night and she returns it in the morning with her notes. The second assistant is supposed to do it, but Miranda is very private and doesn't like strangers going to her house. So until she decides you're not a psycho, I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.
30) 23) dialog: I have no idea. And with that, EMILY pivots and walks away. ANDY looks around, unsure.
32) 6) text: Just then EMILY appears behind ANDY. She dials the phone.
32) 7) dialog: I have Miranda Priestly calling. (calls out) I have Patrick.
32) 10) dialog: Did she say which skirts? (ANDY shakes her head No) Did she say what kind? (No.) Color? Shape? Fabric? (No. No. No.)
32) 12) dialog: You never ask Miranda. Anything. (sighs) All right, I'll take care of the other stuff. You go to Calvin Klein.
32) 14) dialog: I'm sorry. Do you have a prior commitment? Is there some hideous pants convention?
32) 19) dialog: You're not going to the store.
32) 21) dialog: (oh god why me?)
32) 24) dialog: Good God. You do not. Under any circumstances. Take public transportation. On ANDY. I don't?
35) 4) dialog: While you're out... Miranda needs you to go to Hermes and pick up twenty five scarves we ordered for her. Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton, pick that up. And Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, she'll want more Starbucks when she gets back.
37) 0) text: ANDY walks in, laden with stuff and more coffee and snack EMILY springs up.
37) 4) dialog: Oh my God. What took you so long? I have to pee.
37) 7) dialog: You do the coat.
37) 9) dialog: Now, be prepared. The run-through is at 12:30 and people are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.
37) 12) dialog: (exasperated) The editors bring in options for a shoot and Miranda chooses. She chooses every single thing in every single issue. Run-throughs are a huge deal.
37) 15) dialog: No. Sometimes it's busy.
37) 17) dialog: After the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch. (to SERENA, re: ANDY) This is her. The new me.
37) 21) dialog: I told you.
37) 23) dialog: Oh, no. I was quite serious. EMILY turns to ANDY.
37) 24) dialog: I get twenty minutes for lunch, you get fifteen. When I come back, you can go. As ANDY watches EMILY and SERENA'S thin hips as they move down the hall, talking about how absurd ANDY looks.
50) 1) dialog: They also need flip flops.
56) 6) text: Widen out to see EMILY. A beat.
56) 8) text: EMILY ignores her, busy assembling a stack of lookbooks t return to the Art Department.
56) 10) text: EMILY says nothing.
56) 12) dialog: Yes.
56) 13) text: EMILY walks away. 49   EXT. ANDY &amp; NATE'S APARTMENT -- EVENING We see ANDY'S dad, RICHARD, distinguished, if a few pound overweight, is ringing the doorbell to ANDY'S apartment. ANDY calls down.
64) 1) dialog: Excuse me, where do you think you--
67) 0) text: EMILY is talking to SERENA.
67) 1) dialog: I have no idea why Miranda hired her.
67) 4) dialog: I knew from the moment I saw her that she was a complete and utter--
67) 6) dialog: (voice trailing) --disaster.
67) 7) text: ANDY sits down at her desk, pretends she didn't hear her. EMILY is still staring. ANDY'S phone rings.
67) 9) text: She hangs up. EMILY is still gaping.
85) 1) text: A key, as EMILY hands it to ANDY.
85) 2) dialog: Guard this with your life.
85) 4) dialog: (deadpan)
86) 0) text: We hear EMILY'S voiceover as we see this happening.
86) 1) dialog: The Book is assembled by 10 or 10:30, so you must wait around until then. We see ANDY, waiting. The area around MIRANDA'S office is totally quiet.
88) 1) dialog: You'll be delivering Miranda's dry cleaning with the book. We see ANDY removing the dry cleaning from the closet -- about a dozen garments on hangers.
89) 1) dialog: The driver will take you to Miranda's townhouse.
90) 1) dialog: Let yourself in. ANDY takes a deep breath and turns the lock.
92) 0) text: On EMILY, intense.
92) 1) dialog: Do not talk to anyone. Do not look at anyone. That is of the utmost importance. You must be invisible. Do you understand?
93) 1) dialog: Open the door, walk across the foyer, then hang the dry cleaning in the closet across from the staircase. ANDY looks. There are two identical doors on each side of staircase. Dammit.
93) 5) dialog: And leave the Book on the table with the flowers.
95) 2) dialog: You went upstairs? Oh my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?
95) 7) dialog: Don't you understand? If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me. And if that happens, I will search every Blimpie's in the tri-state area until I find you and kill you.
95) 9) dialog: I don't know. She's not happy.
95) 12) text: ANDY and EMILY exchange a look. Oh, boy.
97) 0) text: ANDY paces, panicky. EMILY watches her.
97) 12) dialog: Oh look, you're getting paranoid. Yay. It's not just me. Listen, don't freak out. There could be a silver lining here.
97) 14) dialog: When Miranda gives someone an impossible task, it generally means one of two things. One, she thinks you can actually pull it off.
97) 16) dialog: Or, you know, that thing you were saying about the cat.
102) 2) dialog: You know, I rarely say this to people who aren't me, but you need to calm down. ANDY ignores her, racing around getting the dishes and silverware for MIRANDA'S steak.
115) 18) text: Just then EMILY walks in with a note for MIRANDA.
116) 0) text: ANDY is at her desk. EMILY walks back, blowing her nose, rubbing her eyes -- basically, a Nyquil ad.
116) 2) dialog: Tonight's the benefit. I've been looking forward to it for MONTHS. I refuse to be sick. I'm wearing Valentino. (blows her nose) Everyone's going to be leaving to get dressed soon, so after you drop off Miranda's Fendi bag at the re-beaders, you can just go home.
116) 6) text: EMILY looks at her. Too sick and too Emily to care.
118) 0) text: ANDY and EMILY walk in together, looking confused.
118) 5) text: ANDY and EMILY exchange a look.
118) 8) text: On EMILY and ANDY'S surprised faces.
119) 0) text: They walk out. EMILY is clearly peeved.
119) 1) dialog: I don't see why she needs both of us.
119) 4) text: EMILY dumps something on ANDY'S lap -- a book of what loo like mug shots.
119) 5) dialog: These are all the guests. Miranda invites everyone. We have to make sure they all think she knows exactly who they are. I've been studying for weeks.
119) 7) dialog: Don't be silly.
119) 9) dialog: You have to learn these too.
123) 10) dialog: Oh my God, Andy. You look... chic.
123) 11) text: But ANDY is busy staring at EMILY, in her strapless dress
123) 13) dialog: (flattered) Do I? It's for Paris. I'm on a new diet. I don't eat anything, and then, when I feel like I'm about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.
123) 15) dialog: I know. I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.
123) 17) text: EMILY smiles proudly, then dissolves into another round o bone-rattling coughs.
123) 18) dialog: Ready?
124) 0) text: ANDY and EMILY enter. It's beautiful. Everything in sight white -- white tulips, bone white china, white candles. All the GUESTS are in black or white. EMILY looks around.
124) 4) dialog: We need to make sure we're there the second she walks in.
124) 6) dialog: There she is.
124) 7) text: Just then MIRANDA walks in. She's wearing the awkward dre from JAMES'S sketches, made over to perfection. EMILY and ANDY rush over to MIRANDA. QUICK CUTS at the ball. ANDY and EMILY stand at MIRANDA's side as she fields greetings. EMILY whispers to MIRANDA.
124) 8) dialog: John Folger. New artistic director, Circle in the Square.
124) 12) dialog: (shushes ANDY) She knows him.
124) 19) text: Emily? EMILY racks her brain. Which goes blank. She starts to pa
124) 20) dialog: (fumbling)
124) 21) text: That's... Wait... I know who that is... It's... Seeing EMILY struggle, ANDY leans in to MIRANDA.
124) 24) dialog: Thanks. Just then ANDY sees a very fashionable WOMAN, with a more avant-garde look than MIRANDA, headed for them. And she's being escorted by none other than... IRV. EMILY whispers to ANDY.
124) 30) dialog: Yes. Oh my God. Miranda hates her. She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left... As she says this we see MIRANDA greeting JACQUELINE "warm
124) 42) dialog: You can go. I've got it from here.
124) 44) dialog: Go. Have fun. And for the first time they seem like friends.
130) 2) text: She hangs up. EMILY looks over at her, raises an eyebrow.
130) 3) dialog: Everything okay?
136) 0) text: The desks outside MIRANDA'S office are empty. We hold for few beats. Then ANDY comes in, walking slowly, still unsure. And at that moment MIRANDA appears. They look at each oth MIRANDA nods, almost imperceptibly. ANDY nods back. And MIRANDA takes her coat off. ANDY holds out her arms t take the coat from her. But MIRANDA puts the coat on EMILY'S desk instead. Right front of EMILY'S Arc de Triomphe screensaver. And then MIRANDA strides into her office. ANDY sits down, trying to grasp the magnitude of what just happened. And then MIRANDA pokes her head back in.
137) 0) text: ANDY is waiting for EMILY, dreading her arrival. Suddenly can't take it anymore. She dials the phone.
138) 0) text: EMILY is in even more than her usual tizzy.
138) 5) dialog: Sorry I'm late. Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermes and she told me yesterday but I forgot and so--
138) 7) dialog: I freaked out of course, but then I just called Martine at home and she opened the store early, so I got them.
138) 8) text: EMILY juggles an Hermes bag, her purse, her cell phone, almost mows down an OLD LADY. She mouths "Sorry."
138) 10) dialog: I hope it's not another Miranda problem--
138) 12) dialog: Good. Because I've got so much to deal with before I go, I swear to God I can't even--
138) 13) text: And that's when EMILY steps into the street without looki The second she steps off the sidewalk-- Blam! EMILY is hit by a taxi. We see her purse, her cell phone, her shopping bags, some the orange Hermes boxes, and some of the scarves as they through the air.
140) 0) text: Lying in a hospital bed, her face with no make-up, wearin dumpy hospital robe, EMILY looks like what she is... ...a skinny tired young GIRL.
140) 4) dialog: I don't care if she was going to fire you or beat you with a red hot poker, you should have said no.
140) 6) dialog: Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse.
140) 7) text: Just then an ORDERLY walks in with her dinner, laden with fattening foods -- a cream soup, bread, pasta, cheese and dessert. EMILY grabs a pudding, peels off the foil top.
140) 8) dialog: What gets me about this whole thing is, you're the one who pretends you don't care about this stuff. You don't care about fashion, you just want to be a journalist, blah, blah, blah. What a load of bollocks.
140) 11) dialog: Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos.
140) 13) dialog: (with her mouth full) And you know what really kills me? The clothes you're about to get. You don't deserve them. You eat carbs, for Christ's sake. It's so unfair. (takes another bite) Just go.
140) 18) dialog: I said, go!
175) 0) text: We see EMILY, back at her desk. The camera widens out so can see... a new SECOND ASSISTANT, eager and nervous. She showing EMILY a letter. 
175) 1) dialog: My God, you call this a letter? Can you spell any word in the English language?
175) 2) text: The phone rings. EMILY picks up.
175) 3) dialog: Miranda Priestly's office.
176) 0) text: EMILY looks incredulous.
176) 1) dialog: You're joking. YOU have a favor to ask of ME?
177) 2) text: Beat. EMILY realizes what ANDY is offering, but she won't that show... 
177) 6) dialog: Well, I don't know. It is a huge imposition, but I suppose I could help you out... I'll have Roy pick them up this afternoon. 
178) 0) text: And without a goodbye, EMILY hangs up. The slightest smil creeps across EMILY'S face, but she quickly recovers, han the ASSISTANT the letter. 
178) 1) dialog: Why can't you be more like Andy?
179) 2) dialog: It should be there any second.
