65) 6) dialog: Hey Greg, I just closed this huge  account for you.
65) 8) dialog: You're kidding right?  You're not?  You  told me I could use a different name on  the phone.  Act as if!  I figured I'd  take the initiative and make you some  money.
65) 13) dialog: This is about something else.  Isn't  it?

69) 1) dialog: Hello?
69) 3) dialog: I'm not interested.
69) 5) dialog: That's it?  That's your pitch?  You  consider that a sales call                        
69) 7) dialog: You want to sell me a paper right?   Well you guys call me every Saturday  and I get the same half-assed attempt.   You wanna close me?  Then sell me.
69) 9) dialog: Go ahead, start again.
69) 11) dialog: (smiling) Shitty.  What do you want?
69) 13) dialog: Alright, now you're talking.  What are  you selling?
69) 15) dialog: So, everyone else that already has a  subscription is getting fucked on this  one huh?
69) 17) dialog: Good, I can live with that.  Now why do  I want your paper?  Maybe I should get  the Times or the Voice.
69) 19) dialog: Alright, Ron.  Now that was a sales  call.  Good job!
69) 21) dialog: No.  I already get the Times.

69) 27) dialog: Alright.  I'll be the slut.  So what's  up?
69) 29) dialog: Well, I was thinking that we should go  into the city.  You guys are always  drinking at those shitty local bars.  I  say we go to a decent bar with decent  poo-poo.  If I have to look at one more  housewife smoking a Newport I'm gonna  fucking puke.
69) 33) dialog: (mutters to himself) Jesus.  Am I the only one who doesn't  live with their mother?
69) 36) dialog: Nah, I'm okay.  Hey let me ask you  something, Chris.  Do you ever wonder  how we get the rips that we do?  I mean  how is it that we get rips that pay out  ten times the amount of any major firm?
69) 38) dialog: I'm serious.  Did you know that SEC  regulations state that a maximum rip  allowed is five percent of the sale.   We're making four times that.
69) 40) dialog: Yes.
69) 42) dialog: Nothing.  I'm just curious.  Aren't  you?
70) 0) text: Seth, Chris, Greg, Richie and two of their friends from  another firm, Steve and Roger, are driving on the LIE.   Besides for Seth, they are all wearing suits. Jay-Z blasts on the system.  All heads are bobbing  simultaneously.  Shots of the approaching New York skylin
70) 3) text: The song in the car changes and Richie recognizes it.  He raps along.  Seth jumps in.  Greg, however, doesn't look  happy.   He's pissed that Seth has gotten so close with his friend They make their way down 2nd Ave and park near a trendy  restaurant.
71) 8) text: All of the guys are excited as they approach the table, e Seth.  The host stops, places a menu on the table, and  then...
72) 4) text: Seth leans over toward Chris and whispers...
72) 5) dialog: Uat?
72) 7) dialog: Gotcha.
72) 9) dialog: Yeah.  You know what I hate?  Getting  past the secretaries.  It doesn't  matter that you're a broker calling  from NYC.  It's still a sales call and  that they know.
72) 14) dialog: You guys know what I'm going to do?
72) 16) text: All eyes on Greg, surprised at his tone.  Seth ignores hi
72) 17) dialog: I'm going to open a fire called Bob's  plumbing.  You get on the phone and  say, Yeah tell him it's Bob from Bob's  plumbing.  He'll be like, Oh, it's the  plumber guy, yeah I'll take the call.   Everyone talks to their plumber.
72) 18) text: Laughter all around.  Greg realizes he is alienating not Seth, but his friends too and so he makes amends...
72) 23) dialog: Oh I know.  He's thinking about the  forty accounts I have to open for him  before I'm on my own.  God bless the  junior broker program, huh, Greg?
72) 27) dialog: Yeah, no problem.
74) 1) dialog: Hi Harry, this is Seth Davis over at JT  Marlin.  How you doing this afternoon?
74) 3) dialog: You got a call from an associate broker  of mine last month and I just wanted to  know if you enjoyed the information we  sent you.
74) 5) dialog: If you get as much mail as I do you  probably brushed it aside, but more  importantly we made a commitment to get  back to you.  I am presenting you with  an investment opportunity that I think  you'll find very interesting.
74) 7) dialog: Tell me Harry, are you married or  happy?
74) 10) dialog: Oh yeah?  Six years for me.
74) 12) dialog: Yeah, they sure are.  So, are you  playing the market at all?
74) 14) dialog: Well, I'm calling to tell you about an  explosive situation we have going on  right now.  A pharmaceutical company,  Farrow Tech has a drug called Parattin  in the third stage of FDA approval.
74) 16) dialog: Good question, Harry.  Good question.   This is the best part.  It helps  premature babies develop properly.
74) 18) dialog: It is.  Tell me, those Blue Chips you  own, what have they done for you since  you got married?
74) 20) dialog: Well you see, we deal in stocks that  really move.
74) 22) text: Seth kicks his chair hard enough to send him rolling.
74) 23) dialog: I would love to show you what I mean  and I can do so on a relatively small  investment.
74) 25) dialog: Look, I don't care how much stock you  pick up.  I just want you to test me  out.  Harry, I want you to judge me on  the percentages I show you. Obviously I  show you thirty or forty percent, no  matter how big or small your position  is you're gonna get pretty excited  about my next idea, right?
74) 27) dialog: Of course you would.  You'd be handing  out my business cards, wouldn't you?
74) 29) dialog: Pick up one hundred shares.  It's the  absolute firm minimum.  Okay, if I show  you three or four points on the trade  it's not going to make you rich.  On  the same token, if the stock doesn't go  anywhere you're not out in front of  your store with a cup in your hand.
74) 31) dialog: (serious) Look Harry, the truth is I could sell  you a lot more than one hundred shares  and feel completely comfortable about  the trade, but I'm asking you to start  small just to prove what I can do for  you.
74) 33) dialog: Great!  Should I send the confirmation  to your business or your home?
74) 35) dialog: You don't have to do that, Harry.  And  I going to lunch in five minutes.
74) 37) dialog: I have to ask you something here,  Harry.  You're at work now, aren't you?
74) 39) dialog: Well what do you do, Harry?
74) 41) dialog: Does part of your job involve making  decisions?
74) 43) dialog: Alright, well when you make one of  these decisions do you call your wife  to ask her what you should do?
74) 45) dialog: Different?  How?  It's your money, you  earned it.  Besides, all you're doing  is investing it.  I'm not selling crack  here, Harry.  I  mean she's only going  to be happy when she sees you've made a  wise investment for the family.  Just  think of the flip side.   When your wife does the shopping does  she call you from Pathmark to ask you  if she can use the coupons for Captain  Crunch?
74) 47) dialog: I'm just trying to make a point here,  Harry.  We're not talking about a lot  of money.  Just think what she's going  to say when you bring her back a big  fat check because you had the foresight  to see a good thing coming.
77) 0) text: Everyone in the firm is present tonight.  They all face t front of the room, waiting.  Seth sits next to Chris.

81) 0) text: Seth and Debbie sit staring at the skyline.  Debbie reall feels for him.  We see that here.
81) 2) dialog: (sighs) What's wrong?  Everything, it feels  like.  Not you, but everything else.
81) 4) dialog: Things aren't right at work.  I'm sick  of opening accounts for Greg.
81) 8) dialog: ...Yeah, actually, it is.  We're  finally getting along.  I mean we're  having lunch next week on his request.   Do you know how happy that shit makes  me?!
81) 10) dialog: But it's all based on this fucking job.   This very legitimate respectable job.   A job he can tell his friends about  during the Yom Kippur appeal.  And it's  all bullshit.
81) 12) dialog: I can't do that!  I've invested too  much time and energy.
81) 13) text: Seth takes a deep breath here and stares at Debbie.
81) 15) dialog: I figured out how Michael's making his  money.  I almost wish I hadn't; because  it's all illegal.
81) 17) dialog: It's called bridge financing.  It's so  simple.  A group of investors make a  loan to a private company.  Let's say  for three million.  After the company  gets taken public they pay back a  million in cash and the other two they  pay back in common stock, but at the  IPO price.  So the investors basically  get two million worth of IPO stock.   Then they can sell it on the open  market at triple what they bought it  for.  Now that's actually all legal as  long as the investors are not tied to  the brokerage house.  But Michael's  friends are the investors on every IPO  we do.
81) 19) dialog: Right.  Then he has us push it all on  the open market.  We're selling  Michael's shares.  That's where the two  dollar rips come in.  He can afford to  pay us that much.  He's still in an  obscene profit margin.  It's to his  advantage to give us those rips.  He  has to motivate us to push these  stocks.  He depends on us to literally  create the market.  It's all artificial  demand.  There's no other firm selling  this shit.  That's why he's always  telling us to go into debt.  He wants  us hungry.  Then as soon as we sell off  Michael's position there's no need to  maintain the inflated price anymore.   We stop pushing it and it crashes.  And  get this.  The last IPO, Med Patent,  it's cardboard.  No research and  development, no employees, not even a  fucking building.  Annual reports are  all bullshit.  Michael manufactures  them.  Med Patent doesn't exist.
81) 21) dialog: Now?  I don't know.  Maybe now I go do  it for myself.
82) 0) text: The casino is barely full.  Seth stands there exhausted,  surveying the scene.  Jeff walks over and hands Seth an  envelope.  They exchange hellos but nothing more.

83) 2) text: We see Jeff's head snap up as he stares at Seth through t monitor.  He leaves the table as another dealer replaces
83) 3) dialog: What's going on?  One week I can  understand, but this is approaching  four months, and we're down forty  percent from the last month I was here  full time.
83) 5) dialog: What?  It's my business.  I created it,  remember?  You used to make ten dollars  an hour.  Now you're pulling in a  thousand a week.  And you're still not  happy?  What the fuck is that?  And you  still haven't answered me as to why  profits are down this much.  What's  going on, Jeff?!
83) 7) dialog: For what?  I didn't say anything.  You  skimming, Jeff?
83) 9) text: Seth breathes heavy.  This is his real source of income.
83) 10) dialog: Alright look, why don't you take on  another partner and split your end  which I'll up to sixty-five percent.   Then you can work at night and go to  school during the day.
83) 12) dialog: (surprised) You are?
83) 14) dialog: And you still can't handle it?
83) 16) text: Seth looks off toward the wall and then...
83) 17) dialog: Fuck!!
84) 29) dialog: Doesn't that worry you?
85) 0) text: Seth kneels on the floor rolling dice with some other  brokers.  He turns to see a kid sitting in the waiting ro staring at him just like he did months earlier. Jim walks in and all of the brokers jump to find seats. drops his coat on the desk and starts right up.

85) 14) dialog: Right.  Well, I was reading their  prospectus and... Well, they don't fill  the minimum requirements to be taken  public.
85) 16) dialog: Listen to me.  To float a stock , you  need at least two years worth of  audited financial statements.  They  don't have any.
85) 18) dialog: Chris.  I went to the address listed on  the prospectus. It's an abandoned  building.
85) 19) text: Chris grabs Seth and SHOVES him into a corner.

90) 6) dialog: No.  You even nailed the tie.
90) 8) dialog: I don't know if I'm ready for that.   Too much pressure.  Imagine if I lost  your retirement fund on some small-cap  stock.  God, that would be funny.
90) 12) dialog: (answers carefully) Mostly tech and pharmaceuticals.
90) 14) dialog: Dad.  I didn't know you had it in you.

93) 1) dialog: The only problem you're going to have  is that I didn't come down there an  twist your arm to buy a thousand  shares.  You simply have no idea what  you've tapped into here today.  That's  right.  My secretary will take all your  information.  I have to hop.  Bye.
93) 2) text: Seth pushes the hold button and we pull out to see that t whole table was listening in.  Chris looks proud.
93) 3) dialog: Make it so, Sheryl. (then yelling) Yes!  Finally!  My first whale and my  first account.  My book baby!
93) 6) dialog: Right.  So it's mine.  I'm out of the  junior broker program.  I don't work  for you No Mo'!
93) 8) dialog: Fuck that.  I keep the fortieth.
93) 10) text: Seth looks around to see everyone going back to their sea
93) 11) dialog: Is this about Debbie?  Are you that  bitter?  I have made you a lot of money  over the last three months, more than  any other trainee.

98) 2) dialog: I need to talk to you.
98) 4) dialog: Dad, I really need to talk.
98) 6) dialog: I want out of the firm.
98) 8) dialog: You know how you asked me to invest for  you?  Well I've got something.  It's a  sure thing.
98) 10) dialog: I'm talking about making you half a  million on the next new issue.  And  it's safe.
98) 12) dialog: I play you off as a whale by having you  go in on a couple of big trades that JT  Marlin tells you to invest in.  You  know, prove your loyalty.  Figure  you'll drop $50,000.
98) 14) dialog: Just listen to me.  After you drop the  fifty they'll have faith in you as a  customer.  When the next IPO comes out  you'll get a huge chunk for being so  loyal.  Then instead of holding onto it  until Michael can sell off all of the  common stock, you dump it the same day.   We'll make a fortune and the stock will  immediately collapse.  That should  raise enough red flags for the SEC to  come in and close shop within a week.   We walk rich and JT goes down.
98) 16) dialog: This is the way I want to get out.
98) 18) dialog: But this way I can leave and give them  a taste of their own medicine.
98) 21) dialog: A crime?  You don't like these people  any more than I do.  The whole firm is  crooked.  We're serving justice.  And  who are we committing a crime against?
98) 23) dialog: I just wanted to do this with someone I  trusted, that's all.  I'm getting out  like you told me to.
98) 25) text: Seth gets up, walks to the desk and picks up the phot.

98) 30) dialog: Do you remember when I broke my leg?
98) 32) dialog: Hysterical?  You mean like you are  right now?  I wasn't even crying, Dad.
98) 34) dialog: Sorry I couldn't get the job you wanted  me to have.  But you know what, who  gives a shit?  I'm good at what I do.   The casino was a business!!  A  legitimate business! And I ran it  pretty fucking well, Dad.  To think I  closed it for you.
98) 36) dialog: Then I went after this job because I  thought it was what you wanted me to be  doing.  I didn't know they were a  fucking chop-shop when I went there. (laughs sadly) It's like I can't get away from it.   But I tried to make the changes you  told me to.  I did everything you said.   I'm leaving JT now.  I'm just asking  you to do this one thing with me.  Just  this one last thing.

99) 4) dialog: Sorry.
99) 6) dialog: No.  I told you.  I've invested too  much time.  And I have no fucking money  coming in anymore because Jeff tanked  my gold mine.  I need this.
99) 8) dialog: Doing what?  Ticket running?  Coming  from JT Marlin you think they're going  to let me trade for them?  There's no  way.
99) 9) text: Seth looks up at the ceiling.
99) 10) dialog: Why are you so against this anyway?   What do you care if I pull this off?   It'll be great for both of us.
99) 12) dialog: You know what, I gotta go.
99) 14) dialog: (dazed) I have to go figure this all out.
99) 15) text: Seth gets up and leaves.
101) 2) dialog: That is because I am not fucking  around.  I am making bank today and I  do not care who the fuck I take it  from.
102) 2) dialog: Hi Harry.
102) 4) dialog: Yes Harry, it's just been crazy here.
102) 6) dialog: Sell now?  The stock is down!  You  don't make money in the market buying  high and selling low, Harry.
102) 8) dialog: Alright, here's the deal.  I told you  things would happen within sixty days,  it's only twenty so far, but the  situation here is explosive and I  wanted to get you involved.  That's why  I haven't returned any calls.  I've  been gathering information all morning.   So here it is: The stock's down for  tech reasons.  It's been on the  restricted list all week.  But it's the  same company.  As a matter of fact,  while it was on the restricted list,  Farrow was doing nothing but signing  more contracts.  I'm telling you it's  looking like our next big one here.   Hold on a second, Harry.
102) 9) text: Seth pushes hold.  Jim Young has walked in front of the b and begins to speak to the firm.

102) 12) dialog: Listen to this, Harry.
102) 13) text: Seth holds the phone out toward the chaos.
102) 15) dialog: See what I'm saying?  People know.  The  place is going nuts.  It's already up a  point and its just coming off the  restricted list.  I'm advising all my  clients to get in on this, and heavy.   Hold on a second, let me close the door  to my office.
102) 16) text: Seth holds the phone next to the open drawer of his desk, then slams it shut.  He then clambers under his desk for quiet.
102) 17) dialog: Alright, now you get the same stock  that we picked up at eight, only now  it's at four.  Now, when it was at  eight I told you it was going to  twenty, right?
102) 19) dialog: Right, and it's still going there,  probably even higher now.  This doesn't  change anything except that you're  going to make more money than you did  before.  Look Harry, I liked it at  eight, I love it at four.  It's an  average down for you.
102) 21) dialog: Dollar cost averaging.  If you own a  hundred shares at ten dollars and now  you buy another one hundred at five,  that's a F200 shares at $7.50 a share.   Your cost basis is lower.  Now if I get  you involved at ten and take you out at  fifteen, you've made how many points  Harry?
102) 23) dialog: Exactly.  But if I get you involved at  seven and a half and I take you out at  fifteen, well that's seven and a half  points, that's even better.
102) 25) dialog: I also have a bullet on it.  A couple  of days ago Dan Dorfman, on CNBC, put a  heavy buy recommendation on Farrow  Tech.  Reason being, he's been in  contact with the CEO of the company and  they feel FDA approval will happen in  the next three or four weeks. (gaining speed) Listen to me.  Off the record, I just  called a broker friend of mine at  another firm and had him pick me up  fifty thousand shares under my sister- in-law's name.  I'm going to put all my  kids through college with this stock.   Look, I have a thousand more phone  calls to make, Harry.  I have to call  every one of my clients and give them  this same opportunity.  Remember when  we first spoke?  I told you that this  firm only had five or six great ideas a  year!  Well, Harry, this is one of  those ideas.

106) 30) dialog: Harry, listen, it's going to rebound.

113) 12) dialog: No deal.
113) 14) dialog: Take my father out the back door right  now and bring him home.  He has nothing  to do with this case at all.  If his  name shows up in one newspaper, I don't  testify.  And I mean that.  For me,  it'd be worth going to jail for.
