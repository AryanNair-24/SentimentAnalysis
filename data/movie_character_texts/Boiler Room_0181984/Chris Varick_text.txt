42) 32) dialog: Honestly Doc, I don't have the time.   This stock is blowing up right now.   The whole firm is going nuts.  Let me  open the door to my office.
42) 33) text: Chris holds the phone up to the 100 brokers standing ther silently.  They begin talking loudly and screaming "Buy,  Sell".  Chris makes a hand motion and they stop.

42) 49) text: Chris hits the hold button and then...
42) 50) dialog: Done and done.
42) 51) text: The entire firm applauds when he gets off the phone.  The crowd disperses.  Chris sits down on Seth's desk.
42) 52) dialog: I love doctors, man.  All that money  and not a clue what to do with it.   Fucking rollovers.  Hold onto your  ankles, Doc, here comes the love.
42) 54) dialog: Didn't you tell him how it works?
42) 56) dialog: Right, right.  Make sure he shows you  the ropes.  He's too busy calling his  bookie.  You fucking Hebrews, man.   Always looking out for yourselves,  never the trainees.
42) 59) dialog: Why don't you go make a latke dreidel  boy. (back to Seth) The reason I capped him is in case he's  a piker.  See, we're going to go ahead  and front the money for this sale.   If he doesn't send the check, I'm the  one holding the bag. (whispers) Last commission month a kid on Jim's  team wrote a million dollar ticket.   Stock was down three and a half points  by settlement.  Fucking kid took a one  quarter million dollar hit.  Besides,  first sale just whets the appetite.  If  he's a whale, which it looks like he  is, then I'll get him on a day when  there's a real rip.
42) 61) dialog: (surprised) Rip.  Commission.  That's why we work  here.  We get huge rips.
42) 63) dialog: A two dollar rip, which is unheard of  anywhere on Wall Street, means you're  walking away with two dollars for every  share you sell.  Real money.  Jesus  Greg, you tell him where the bathroom  is yet?
42) 66) dialog: I don't know, but if he's doing it,  he's making money on it.  Point is,  don't worry about selling small on the  first trade.  You service the client  right and he'll be back for more.  Bide  your time.  Show him a three percent  return and he'll trust you to watch his  kids for the weekend.  If he's serviced  correctly it's not a matter of whether  he's making a second trade with you,  it's a matter of how much.

69) 35) dialog: You want something to drink?
69) 37) dialog: Are you kidding me?  That's the wrong  question to be asking.  Who cares how.   The only thing you should be wondering  about is how you're gonna get laid  tonight.
69) 39) dialog: What are you doing, Seth?  Aren't you  happy with the way things are going?
69) 41) dialog: So what are you doing making trouble  for yourself?

72) 11) dialog: I remember when I was cold calling, the  shit I'd do.  I'd get on the phone and  say, Can I speak to Jim?  Secretary's  like, I'm sorry, but Jim isn't in the  office.  I'd be like, that's funny  because I just saw his car in the lot  about five minutes ago.   Next thing you know, Jimbo's on the  phone because you showed the lady you  weren't fuckin' around.

85) 17) dialog: Look Seth.  I thought we already went  through this.  You're a good kid, and I  like you a lot, but this is bullshit.   Michael knows all about this stuff.  We  don't.  He doesn't tell you how to  trade, so don't tell him how to do his  business.  He's the reason we make  bank, and he hasn't steered us wrong,  ever.
