Look, this is off the record, but I  spoke to the controller this morning.   He assured me that they will be  reporting better than expected third  quarter earnings next month. (soothing) Right.

8) 6) text: One of Greg's trainees, MARC, approaches with a stack of  cards.
8) 8) dialog: I hope these are better than the last  batch of shit you gave me.  You produce  more wood than Ron Jeremy.
8) 10) dialog: I see you making your calls.  Listen to  me, you can't just get on the phone and  say, 'Can I send you some information?'   If you want them off the phone so bad,  why don't you just hang up?  You have  to excite them about things.   You want them to beg for a broker on  that first call.
8) 11) text: Debbie walks through the trading floor to drop a package at a broker's desk.  Greg watches, seething.
8) 13) dialog: Just stop pussying out every time  someone picks up the phone; it's what  you want.

20) 34) text: Seth takes the money and pushes it into the cash box.  He then counts up $5,000 in chips for Greg.
20) 36) dialog: If the shoe fits, baby.  Oh shit.  You  got real chips.
20) 38) dialog: (laughing) Look, they even say "Seth's" on 'em.   This is no joke.
20) 42) text: Greg reaches over to the platter for a sandwich.

20) 47) dialog: (laughing) Holy shit, would you listen to this  kid.
22) 0) text: It's the end of the night.  Seth sits with Greg.
22) 1) dialog: I'm just saying, this is risky  business.  You plan on dealing cards to  college kids when you're thirty-five?   Think you won't get busted in the next  two years?  You need to start thinking  about down-the-line time.
22) 3) dialog: (laughs) First of all, I'm not done with your  here.  And no, you'll only be working  for me for a short time.  You learn the  ropes, pass the series seven, then  you're on your own.  Just ask Adam,  he'll tell you.
29) 0) text: It's 8:00 and the trading room is already packed.  Seth s at his new desk with a box of cards in front of him. Greg drops down in a seat next to him.  He picks up the b of cards and starts right in.
29) 1) dialog: These are the D&B cards.  Dunn and  Bradstreet.
29) 3) text: Greg checks his paper as he continues...
29) 4) dialog: They're the company that supply us with  our leads.  Every one of these cards is  an opportunity.  These are good leads.   People on these cards buy stock.  Your  job is to call them and get them  interested in the firm.  You're not  actually selling stock yet, but you're  selling the dream.  Get 'em wet and  tell them that in a month from now a  senior broker will call them back with  one idea.
29) 6) dialog: Average client's forty-five years old,  from the Midwest, two hundred and fifty  thousand dollar annual income, three  million net.  Has a local broker, but  loves a New York guy who sounds good on  the phone.  The card's not gonna tell  you any of that.  Only says their name,  address and occupation.  You gotta feel  them out. (picks up card) Here.  Peter Davis, Vice President of  Parks Telecommunications.  Guy's  probably a whale.  See what he's  playing with.  Truth is it doesn't  matter these days.  With the DOW where  it is now, everyone wants a piece of  the market.  I can close anyone at any  time anywhere in the country.  Just  give me a phone number.
29) 9) dialog: I'm not here.  After you qualify the  guy you send him a press packet.  It's  all really easy and it'll get you  feeling comfortable on the phone, which  is key.  This entire business revolves  around the phone.  A good broker makes  over seven hundred calls a day.
29) 11) dialog: This month was approaching four hundred  thousand.  Now listen to me.  Even  though you're not actually selling  stock yet, I want you to remember the  coda we have here. Did you see  Glengarry Glenross?
29) 13) dialog: Alright then, you remember ABC?
29) 15) dialog: Right.  Always -- Be -- Closing.   That's the attitude you need.  Always  be closing Seth.  Telling's not  selling.  Now there's two rules you  need to know as a trainee.  The rest  will come later.  Number one, we do not  pitch the bitch here.
29) 17) dialog: We don't sell stock to women.  I don't  care who it is, we don't do it.  I'm  serious.  Nancy Sinatra calls, you tell  her you're sorry.  They're a constant  pain in the ass and never worth the  trouble.   They will call you every fucking day  asking you why the stock is dropping.   And God forbid the stock should go up  you'll hear from them every fifteen  minutes. (mocking) Is it a good time to sell?  It's simply  not worth the time or effort.
29) 19) dialog: Second rule.  Don't write wood.  A lot  of trainee are so anxious to get off  the phone they just steamroll the guy  into getting the press pack so they can  hang up.  Then I call in a month and  say, Hi, you spoke to a junior  associate of mine last month.  The  guy's like, Yeah, I'm not interested.   Bye.  That's a shitty lead.  It's  fucking wood.  The info we send is  bullshit.  The important part of the  call is telling them you have that one  great idea, and that a broker is going  to call them back in a month.  This  shows that we don't just fire a million  recos a day.  We tell them we have six  or seven great ideas a year!  They  don't want to think you're pitching  them something you read in the journal  this morning.  Get it?  No wood. 
29) 21) dialog: Don't even start with that shit.  I'm  just telling you what your place is and  what I expect of you.  I'm making your  job easier.
29) 22) text: This is not the Greg that Seth remembers from the casino.
29) 24) dialog: Alright, now we're talking.  You should  go into every call thinking just that.   If they want a recommendation, you put  the guy on hold, you stand up, and yell  "RECO" at the top of your lungs.  The  first senior broker to get to the phone  gets the sale.
30) 0) text: Seth walks up the path toward Greg's house.  It's a beaut The door is open and Seth slowly lets himself in.  He pas through the living room which as no furniture -- just  cardboard boxes waiting to be unpacked. In the den there are 15 guys from the firm sitting on the floor.

30) 11) dialog: So you say.  Nice to meet you.  Hope  you're intelligent.  Where'd you get  these?
30) 13) dialog: So what's on your mind, Kimosabi?  Why  am I listening to you?
33) 6) dialog: Hey Warren Buffet, you trying to e  cute?  Make the fucking calls!  You're  not a fund manager!  How's it going  there, Seth?
33) 7) text: Seth shrugs his shoulders.  Greg comes over.  The phone i ringing.
33) 9) dialog: Okay, first of all there are going to  be a lot of those regardless of how  good you are.  But you happen to suck  dick.  I have this friend who runs this  other firm.  He gives out this book to  all his trainees.  The Rebuttal Book.   Looks like a fil-o-fax.  Has those  index tabs but they don't say A to B to  G to H, they say things like Wife won't  let me, I'm not in the market now, Call  me back, Send me a prospectus.   Has a rebuttal for any excuse.  That's  all the shit you're gonna have to learn  later.  For now you only have to  remember one thing.  You can be whoever  you want on the phone.  So say what you  have to.  Use a different name if you  want.  Tell them you're a vice- president here.  Just get them on the  line.  That's the first step.  It's the  hardest part sometimes, but just get  the cocksucker on the line.
33) 11) dialog: Illegal?  No, Seth.  Everyone does that  shit.  Even on Wall Street.  And John  over there, he works for us.
33) 12) text: Greg points to John who is at a desk in the back of the r
33) 13) dialog: He's a fucking chimp.  The only  compliance work he's doing is making  sure my lunch is still hot when it gets  here.  He's only here because the SEC  requires it.  He might have the easiest  fucking job in the entire world.  Look  at him I think he's actually  masturbating right now.

49) 5) dialog: These guys are no joke.  They get  tanked up, throw a quick fist.  And  then some of them actually like it.   Like Richie.  He probably thought I was  being tough back there, just staring at  that guy.  I was shitting my pants.
49) 7) dialog: Thanks.  Those fucking Guineas, half of  them do coke.  They all drink.  No  stability, zero capital.  They make all  this money and they're always living  three steps ahead.  Do you know there  are guys in this firm that make close  to a million a year and couldn't get a  loan for a Honda because their credit  is so bad.  Everyone's just waiting for  the fifteenth of the month.  It's like  they may drive a Porsche but they don't  have ten bucks to put in the gas tank.   Nigger rich.
