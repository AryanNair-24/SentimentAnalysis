It’s this same attitude that brought us Prohibition Vietnam, and fifty years of living on the brink of nuclear destruction. (pointing to Ron) But for a member of the government to come on this show and lecture about cancer, when the same government for the last sixty years has been producing atomic bombs, twenty-five thousand of them, capable of giving every man, woman, and child on this planet cancer so awful, so ghastly, so untreatable, that medical science doesn’t even have a name for them yet, is just beneath contempt.
6) 10) dialog: Oprah, how on earth would “Big Tobacco” profit off of the loss of this young man? I hate to think in such callous terms, but if anything we’d be losing a customer. It’s not only our hope but it’s in our best interests to keep Robin alive and smoking.
