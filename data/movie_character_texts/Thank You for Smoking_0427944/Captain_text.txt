17) 13) dialog: Do you enjoy your current work, Nick?
17) 15) dialog: You kind of struggled before this.
17) 17) dialog: It’s one of the reasons we hired you. Nick looks up in disbelief (”really?”).

17) 21) dialog: Tell me, what is your opinion of BR?
17) 23) dialog: I like to think that I’m your boss, son. But I do admire loyalty in a man. I can forgive almost anything in a man if he’s loyal. Like that Oprah show you did. You could have given up, cried and apologized, but you stayed loyal. And you gave it to that son’v’a bitch good.
17) 25) dialog: BR’s come under the idea that we should start bribing Producers in Hollywood to make their actors smoke on screen. It takes every part of Nick’s strength to not verbally dismantle BR right there and then.

18) 19) dialog: I want you to work on this Hollywood project. Get out there within the next couple weeks, stir something up.
