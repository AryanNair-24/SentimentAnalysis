11) 6) dialog: No, a mosinite.
11) 8) dialog: No, a fuckin mosinite.            It's the updated zirconia.
11) 10) dialog: Zirconias are artificial diamonds, they look pretty good to the novice like you Lincoln. But you could break them with a hammer, so they came up with mosinites.

30) 9) text: He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very r rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needl to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling.

30) 14) dialog: You think you can try me?
32) 0) text: Sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through.
32) 1) dialog: Drop the screen now! You just seen what it did to this wall so think what it could do to you. Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely scared.
32) 4) dialog: How you doing Vince? A weakened voice retorts.
32) 6) dialog: Now fill this bag. . . ' . - . -
32) 8) dialog: I am not here to make a fuckin bet.

They push the door nothing happens. There is no going back. Sol starts to kick the glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swift Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass door shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's pa filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaw of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and wai for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh. Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. Amongst the yell emanating from Vince we can hear Sol's pathetic and despe whimpering.
