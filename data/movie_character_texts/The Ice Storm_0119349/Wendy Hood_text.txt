Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto field where the boys are playing. A group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them.

The quarterback spots him and throws a long one. He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound. The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of own, to run.

Just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the stairs -- Ben towers above them, looking down.

She notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks o of the room.

15) 69) dialog: That's nice. Are you drunk?
