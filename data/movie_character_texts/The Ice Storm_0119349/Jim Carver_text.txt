4) 51) dialog: It was a benefit for the ACLU or something, and Harry Reems himself was there --
4) 53) dialog: The very one -- something about a first amendment defense fund -- well I believe in it --
4) 58) dialog: -- pulls right up to the pump, jumps out like there's no gas shortage, oblivious, and by this point everybody in line's piling out of their cars ready to kill the guy, when they notice it's that Reverend Edwards --
4) 60) dialog: Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek Road and didn't notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile.
4) 87) dialog: Will do.
4) 267) dialog: Hey guys, I'm back.
4) 269) dialog: (a look of disappointment)  Yeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston, working on some great new ideas about silicon, which comes from sand, very conductive. How you guys doing? How's school? Mikey's still flustered.
4) 271) dialog: Hmm. Alright! He walks off.
4) 275) dialog: (as he sits) You bet. It turns out it's a water bed, and his weight creates a w that nearly pushes Janey off her edge of the bed.
4) 277) dialog: (jumping up, which only creates another wave) Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
4) 279) dialog: (as he begins to unpack) You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
4) 281) dialog: Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh? He laughs to himself. She gives him a look.
14) 171) dialog: Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
14) 173) dialog: Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
14) 175) dialog: Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really. They sit down on the sofa.
14) 176) dialog: You want coffee or something?
14) 178) dialog: Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
14) 182) dialog: What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
14) 184) dialog: Nah, that wasn't in the contract. But they still walk around turning off lights. In the hallway, Elena looks a bit mournfully at the light seeping from underneath the bathroom door. She hears the sound of running water from inside. Then she goes into a sideroom and joins Jim. They pick up their coats.
14) 187) dialog: We're going to have to defrost this thing for a while. He turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow col air at them. He leans over and kisses her.
14) 189) dialog: That was awful, really awful. I'm so sorry, Elena. Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the g compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself.
14) 190) dialog: Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
14) 192) dialog: Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly
14) 195) dialog: That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
14) 197) dialog: Of course. She opens the door and walks back to the house.
15) 23) dialog: You okay?
15) 25) dialog: Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
16) 0) text: Jim and Elena arrive on foot.
16) 1) dialog: You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
17) 1) dialog: Phone's out. I hope the pipe's -- He walks into the kitchen. The pipes have begun to burst. There's a water leak running down the walls, forming a pu on the floor. Elena has walked into the kitchen behind him. She leans against the counter, picking up the garter belt without thinking for a second, then putting it back down.
17) 2) dialog: Oh well. Why don't you put on some dry socks -- and we've got some rain boots in the guest closet back there. Last room upstairs -- back of the hall. Elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.
21) 0) text: on the living room floor, Jim is hugging Mike's body, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing. Wendy walks and stands next to Sandy, who is filled momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger towar her -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childl hug, then turns and runs out the door, joining Ben and El on the driveway. Sandy watches her go, his face wet with tears.
