4) 37) dialog: No thank you. We should be off.
4) 41) dialog: Dinner's on the counter. We'll be at the Williams's -- you know the number.  (takes the phone from Wendy) Paul. Hi. Is there anything you'll want, any particular kind of food or snack or anything we can stock up on?... You're all right? ... OK. See you next week. I love you. Back to Nixon on the TV.
4) 49) dialog: You should hear. It's very sad, he was --
4) 68) dialog: Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
4) 72) dialog: It's not a bother.
4) 74) dialog: Oh.
4) 76) dialog: Of course.
4) 79) dialog: A key party?
4) 84) dialog: Thank you Janey.
4) 112) dialog: (without opening her eyes) You're staring at me.
4) 114) dialog: I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
4) 116) dialog: I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
4) 119) dialog: So maybe you'll come too?
4) 121) dialog: It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
4) 123) dialog: -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
4) 125) dialog: (sighing) Sleep in the study? Please. Ben picks up a pillow and walks out, pausing wistfully at door.
4) 127) dialog: Good night.
4) 174) dialog: Yes.
4) 176) dialog: Yes, it was -- I ended up --
4) 185) dialog: I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
4) 187) dialog: (cutting him off) My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years. (still not really looking at him) When was the last time you rode a bike?
4) 189) dialog: (jarred back to his presence)  Forget what?
4) 191) dialog: No, of course you don't, you're right.
4) 224) dialog: Hi Wendy. Without waiting for instructions, Wendy starts pulling ou plates and silverware and setting the table.
4) 225) dialog: I saw you on your bike today.
4) 227) dialog: Who?
4) 229) dialog: Mikey Williams?
4) 231) dialog: Well, you looked very -- free -- when I saw you. Wendy continues setting the table.
4) 232) dialog: Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
4) 234) dialog: Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
4) 236) dialog: The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
4) 238) dialog: We've been through this Wendy  James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
4) 240) dialog: Oh Wendy. Wendy frowns.
4) 242) dialog: I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
4) 244) dialog: Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
4) 248) dialog: The Halfords have invited us again this year.
4) 250) dialog: What do you think?
4) 253) dialog: So early?
4) 255) dialog: Is that a new aftershave? He recoils a bit.
4) 257) dialog: Hmm. Good night. He walks uncertainly from the room. Does she suspect?
4) 284) dialog: You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
4) 286) dialog: All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
4) 288) dialog: That's right.
4) 290) dialog: I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
4) 292) dialog: I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
4) 294) dialog: But not too ashamed.
4) 296) dialog: And you're still trying to get me into bed.
4) 299) dialog: I suppose we'll make an appearance.
4) 304) dialog: (gathering her things to go) I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  (getting up) Take care.
4) 326) dialog: Thanks again. For the dinner.
4) 328) dialog: I used to know how to cook.
4) 330) dialog: I'm thinking of going back to school.
4) 332) dialog: How'd you know?
4) 334) dialog: I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
5) 2) dialog: (opening her door) Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
6) 0) text: Elena watches the car pull away. She turns and walks into store.
6) 58) dialog: Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
6) 60) dialog: Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
6) 62) dialog: I... I think I am...
6) 64) dialog: Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to-- She kisses him as if she needed him.
6) 69) dialog: I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
6) 71) dialog: No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  (beat) What is going to happen with us? Have you --
6) 73) dialog: I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
6) 75) dialog: You were saying? He smells the armpits of the shirt he's putting on.
6) 77) dialog: That shirt?
6) 79) dialog: Leave it -- I'll wash it for you. He looks at her ruefully.
6) 134) dialog: The turkey in?
11) 34) dialog: (from the kitchen) Dinner in ten minutes.
11) 39) dialog: Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
11) 41) dialog: So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
11) 43) dialog: Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
11) 45) dialog: That one. She walks down to the kitchen, Benjamin following her.
11) 49) dialog: You'll be on the 10:30 train?
11) 52) dialog: Paul --
11) 62) dialog: See for yourself.
11) 64) dialog: Don't start.
11) 66) dialog: I have no idea.
11) 68) dialog: It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
11) 70) dialog: Don't be dim.
11) 72) dialog: I'm not surprised.
11) 74) dialog: Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
11) 76) dialog: It's a starting place.
11) 78) dialog: If you're going to insult me --
12) 1) dialog: Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
12) 3) dialog: Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it? Seemingly tired, he stands before her. Silence. Elena sig then walks into the den.
12) 5) dialog: We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
12) 8) dialog: I suppose. Why?
12) 10) dialog: What sort of problems are you planning exactly? Elena kisses the top of her head.
12) 12) dialog: Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
12) 20) dialog: Oh, damn. Uh, I've left the --
12) 22) dialog: In the car.
13) 0) text: Ben and Elena climb back in the car and close the doors, shivering.
13) 1) dialog: This just isn't the best moment for this.
13) 3) dialog: That this was going to be a key party?
13) 5) dialog: Well?
13) 7) dialog: Damn it, Ben --
13) 9) dialog: You're not going to --
13) 11) dialog: You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
13) 14) dialog: Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
13) 16) dialog: Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you. She pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the c and slams the door. He follows her.
13) 18) dialog: Oh, Dot! Elena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at Dot Halford, who looks surprised. Hood slides in behind his wife. Dot drops the keys into the bowl. Slow-motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, f in with a THUNDEROUS CRASH.
14) 0) text: The room is crowded with nervous, expectant couples and various groupings. Elena slips into a side room. Benjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and po a stiff one, turning around to find at his elbow none oth than George Clair.
14) 80) dialog: Reverend Edwards.
14) 82) dialog: You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
14) 84) dialog: I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile. Philip's about to reply, but thinks better of it. They sit glumly next to each other for a minute. Then Phi rises.
14) 135) dialog: We're not going anywhere. Elena waves at Janey Williams, who is standing across the living room. Janey looks back without expression.
14) 170) dialog: Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves. You two go and get acquainted. We'll let ourselves out the front door. Jim and Elena stand there alone.
14) 172) dialog: Let me. She takes the bowl and dips her hand in. Two sets are lef One, her own, she avoids. She takes out Jim's keys and wa across the room, handing them to him.
14) 174) dialog: You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
14) 177) dialog: Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
14) 179) dialog: My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all. They both look at their hands.
14) 180) dialog: Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't
14) 183) dialog: Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
14) 188) dialog: Do these seats go back? That starts it. He jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzip himself. They tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. And then, comically, he's in her. With a groan, it's over in a flash. Jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.
14) 191) dialog: Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
14) 194) dialog: Well, we can talk about it.
14) 196) dialog: Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
15) 0) text: Elena hesitantly walks to the bathroom. She opens the door. Ben's sitting on the floor, next to t toilet, woozily flipping through the pages of a magazine.
15) 2) dialog: Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
15) 4) dialog: Ben. She sits on the toilet next to him, stroking his hair.
15) 5) dialog: You're in no condition to drive. We'll talk in the morning, OK? He sits, accepting and quiet.
15) 6) dialog: You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
15) 8) dialog: We'll talk in the morning.
15) 24) dialog: Yeah. You?
16) 0) text: Jim and Elena arrive on foot.
16) 2) dialog: Sure. Maybe coffee.
18) 0) text: Elena opens the door, and discovers Wendy and Sandy aslee She stands before the bed, and gazes down on them. They look almost angelic. Wendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes, slowly coming out of sleep.
18) 1) dialog: (heartbroken, softly) Get dressed. Elena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen. Wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping peacefully. She looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up around him.
18) 3) dialog: You should let him sleep. Wendy enters. She looks inquisitively at the two adults.
20) 3) dialog: It'll warm you up. Elena sits next to her. They both raise their cups and si the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their moveme
20) 8) dialog: Ben? He's too breathless to speak. They stand there, looking down at Mikey. Behind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears. He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.
20) 11) dialog: The phone's out.
20) 13) dialog: Ben, I don't think he wants us here. Wendy has been watching Sandy through the screen door.
22) 1) dialog: Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
22) 9) dialog: (softly) Ben. Paul looks at Wendy, silently asking her what's happening She casts her eyes downward, as does he.
22) 10) dialog: (her hand still not yet touching him) Ben.
