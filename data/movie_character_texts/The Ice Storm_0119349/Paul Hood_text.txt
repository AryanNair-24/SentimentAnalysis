He read his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign. Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of t train's engines returns. The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his class nasal voice.
1) 10) dialog: In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four, published in November 1973, Reed Richards has to use his anti-matter weapon on his own son, who Annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb. His son is the result of Richards' coupling with the earthling Sue Storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four on their aborted moon mission have made young Franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti-matter.
2) 1) dialog: And that's what it is to come from a family, if you analyze it closely. Each of them is negative matter for the other ones. And that's what dying is -- dying is when your family, which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge -- it's when the family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space... INT. TRAIN. CONT'D. On Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glo warmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the com book.

4) 32) dialog: Watching what?
4) 40) dialog: (on the phone) Hey Charles. Charles, calm down -- I wasn't in on it. Elena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives Wendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-by to Paul on the phone.
6) 3) dialog: To find yourself in the Negative Zone, as the Fantastic Four often do, means that all everyday assumptions are inverted -- even the invisible girl herself becomes visible, and so she loses the last semblance of her power.

6) 128) dialog: It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
6) 130) dialog: Her name's Libbets.
6) 139) dialog: I'll be out in a second. Ben walks back to the bedroom, smirking.
11) 47) dialog: See you. 
11) 50) dialog: 
11) 54) dialog: Libbets. Libbets Casey.
14) 33) dialog: Libbets Casey, please.
14) 35) dialog: Paul Hood.
14) 41) dialog: (under his breath) We? And there, in the den, cleaning an ounce of dope on an op copy of Nixon's Six Crises, is -- Francis.

14) 48) dialog: Huh?
14) 54) dialog: (handing him a beer) Hey, it's a sellable skill. Francis licks closed a second joint, then takes the beer opens it with his rear molars.

14) 89) dialog: Valium. Seconal. Uh, (can't quite pronounce this one) Par-er-goric? (a beat, looking into the mirror for effect) Francis Chamberlain Davenport the Fourth -- tonight you sleep the sleep of the just. He pockets the Seconal and turns out the light.

14) 93) dialog: Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.

14) 102) dialog: (hand in pocket) Libbets, you really shouldn't mix and match, you know with the beer. I'll put 'em back. Libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle.
14) 104) dialog: Maybe you should have just a half.
14) 117) dialog: I guess he's just real exhausted from, you know, tests and stuff. Libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland.
14) 119) dialog: You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
14) 121) dialog: Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
