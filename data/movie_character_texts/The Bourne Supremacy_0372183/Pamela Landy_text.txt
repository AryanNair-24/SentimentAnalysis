Four serious people alone in this room: PAMELA LANDY is 46. A Senior C.I.A. Counterintelligence Officer. Hovering over the communications console. CRONIN -- Pamela's #2 -- early forties, stone-cold facade quarterbacking the operation over the radio -- KURT and KIM are the techs here. His and Her headphones. Ruggedized laptops and comm gear spread around them.
50) 5) dialog: (a bit surprised) Martin?
51) 2) dialog: That's where we came out.
51) 6) dialog: We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
51) 8) dialog: For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
51) 10) dialog: Yes, sir. I'm in total agreement. If they're fakes, they're expensive. (furious, impatient) Gentlemen, I've got the seller on site and in play. Quite honestly, there's not much more to talk about. MARSHALL looks to his MANDARIANS. Not convinced, but doesn't want to lose the opportunity. Time to wash his hands.

73) 7) dialog: I want to know about Treadstone.
73) 13) dialog: (trump card) He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
76) 0) text: As they were. ABBOTT watching PAMELA pull a photo from he file. Sliding it over. CONKLIN'S FACE peering back.
76) 1) dialog: Let's talk about Conklin.
76) 3) dialog: I want to know what happened.
76) 7) dialog: So you had Conklin killed. (silence) I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
76) 9) dialog: And Bourne? Where's he now?
76) 11) dialog: I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off. (beat) They were killed by Jason Bourne. ABBOTT hesitates. Blindsided. What? A courtesy knock at the door.

81) 15) dialog: What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
81) 20) dialog: I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. * (MORE )
81) 22) dialog: And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again. (to Abbott) How's that scan? As the MANDARINS all start talking at once -- ZORN enters. Stands at the head of the table. Tries to get their attention.

92) 7) dialog: If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a * highly-experienced field officer... * (continuing as--)
92) 10) dialog: I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
92) 12) dialog: I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is... BOURNE already turning the key in the ignition -- THE PEUGEOT ROARING TO LIFE, as he writes the number. Dropping the car into gear, BOURNE pulls briskly away fro the curb.
93) 0) text: PAMELA finishes, hangs up.
93) 2) dialog: I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
93) 4) dialog: And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him... Before it can come to blows --

100) 1) dialog: I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
100) 3) dialog: Are you an expert in amnesia?
100) 5) dialog: Believed what?
100) 11) dialog: So he fooled you.
100) 13) dialog: (leans in; still low) Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story. (shifts gears) Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
100) 15) dialog: You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
100) 17) dialog: Did you?

100) 21) dialog: See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from. PAMELA leans away. NICKY looks back out the window. ee eK ee eK
