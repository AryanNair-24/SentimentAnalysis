19) 3) text: So you're the one. Hearing, other workers look up.  Among them is a female ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no concession to her sex.  Throughout, she'll watch Jordan with more than passing interest.
19) 8) dialog: B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
19) 10) dialog: No problem, lieutenant.
26) 0) text: Blondell is ending her shift.  She shoulders a purse and pauses at a window, seeing... The trainees shuffling into formation like the living dead.  Jordan is still among them.
28) 0) text: BLONDELL'S POV:  Of a lone figure crossing to the bell.
41) 0) text: Jordan slaps down old room keys and new orders.  Blondell scans the paperwork with deepening concern.
41) 1) dialog: This some kind of joke?
48) 0) text: Blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign, tall and striking.  Passing the bell, Blondell checks on... The helmets lined up beneath.  A dozen already. An O.S. CADENCE CALL -- then, led by Wickwire, trainees double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a beach run.  Among them, still, is Jordan.  It brings a Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face.
48) 4) text: Barkin' up the wrong dress, Slutnik. You ain't their type. Overhearing, Jordan snaps a look at Blondell, only now realizing.  Their eyes meet.
76) 1) dialog: S.E.R.E. training coming up. Eating at a table with other women, Jordan turns to see Blondell setting down her tray.
76) 2) dialog: They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
76) 4) dialog: Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
76) 6) dialog: Just some of the women.
77) 2) dialog: I've been accused of that wish.
77) 4) dialog: Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
77) 6) dialog: More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising. They laugh.
77) 7) dialog: Sounds funny now, but it's really not.  We have to be careful.  The Navy still knows how to put on a witch-hunt. Reaching the quarterdeck, they scan a message board. Jordan finds a half-dozen phone slips for her.
120) 9) dialog: Sorry.  Forgot I needed oregano and... She sees Wickwire.  An awkward beat for them all.
122) 0) text: Jordan enters.  The yeoman's desk is unattended.  Noticin the X.O.'s door open, Jordan peers inside to find... Blondell.  She looks scared out of her mind.  Before she and Jordan can speak, the yeoman materializes.
123) 11) text: You were seen leaving Ensign Blondell's apartment at approximately 0-200, whereupon physical affections were exchanged in public.
131) 1) dialog: Administration, Ensign Blondell.
131) 3) dialog: Who's... (brightening)
131) 6) dialog: Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
132) 0) text: File in hand, Blondell returns to the phone.
132) 1) dialog: Got it.
132) 3) dialog: Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking... She finds a crisp sheet of stationary, out of place among the smeared government forms.
132) 4) dialog: Wow...
177) 2) text: Special Reconnaissance Class 118, you may now stand down. All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites, the former trainees erupt with ONE GREAT HOO-YAH.  What began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40. Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce, smiling through his fears.  Not far away sits Blondell. No one claps louder. Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates. Pyro finally manages to take her aside.
