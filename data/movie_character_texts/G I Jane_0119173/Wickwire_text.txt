23) 10) dialog: Just trying to thin the herd. That's all they want to do right now. Some of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on a cheap wet T-shirt contest.  Jordan covers herself instinctively -- and hates the instinct.  Modesty isn't going to get her through this.
23) 13) dialog: I got eyes, Newberry.
29) 0) text: QUICK CLOSEUPS of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to watch someone cross the grinder.  At least we know who it isn't. CLOSE on the Chief as the BELL RINGS THREE TIMES.  He turns around to find... Stamm at the bell. For the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan. Was he expecting her?
29) 3) dialog: Cuh-lass, face right! They march off.
31) 2) dialog: They're more afraid of you.
31) 4) dialog: It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
31) 6) dialog: It was made clear. (getting up)
31) 9) dialog: Made it to Week 10 last time.
31) 11) dialog: You're kind of a surprise yourself. A faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across the courtyard that separates the two B.O.Q. buildings. Back across no-man's land.
33) 3) dialog: Fuck.  Yes sir.
33) 27) dialog: (low to Jordan)
46) 25) dialog: 'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals, no more.
46) 28) dialog: Huh-uh -- but wasn't middla February last time, either.
46) 49) dialog: Hey.  Way to gut it out.
48) 0) text: Blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign, tall and striking.  Passing the bell, Blondell checks on... The helmets lined up beneath.  A dozen already. An O.S. CADENCE CALL -- then, led by Wickwire, trainees double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a beach run.  Among them, still, is Jordan.  It brings a Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face.
106) 2) dialog: (a beat)
106) 5) dialog: Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit. A beat.
106) 7) dialog: When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
106) 9) dialog: One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
106) 11) dialog: Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
106) 13) dialog: So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
106) 15) dialog: At first.
106) 17) dialog: Not me.  You? It hurts to think about it.  The Potomac.  The gunkhole harbor.  Royce.
106) 18) dialog: O'Neil?
106) 20) dialog: (a beat)
113) 21) text: We're done here. Beaten, he walks right out of camp. Wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes. Wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight.  But this time he made it. A medic tries to help Jordan, but she pushes him away, walking drunkenly for... Flea.  She begins wiping the makeup from his face.
120) 0) text: Jordan exits with purchases.  Her face is still bruised from S.E.R.E.  With a minute to kill, she peruses a bulletin board casually.  But a RAISED VOICE leads her eyes to... Wickwire.  At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.  H looks flustered when he spots Jordan.
120) 2) dialog: That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
120) 4) dialog: Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
120) 7) dialog: I think you look beautiful.
120) 11) dialog: Sure, sure.
120) 13) dialog: Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask. Jordan and Blondell head for the parking lot.  HOLD on Wickwire, looking after them.  Thinking it through.
123) 8) dialog: I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
123) 17) dialog: (only to Jordan)
125) 0) text: RING THREE:  On Wickwire as he walks across the base.  Hi regrets are obvious.
131) 8) text: "Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
145) 2) text: One of you here understands better than anyone what this is all about. Someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming.  Someone who knows, I would hope, what he must now do. CLOSE on Wickwire.  Feeling the heat.  Wondering if they really know who it is.  Now the C.O. parks himself right in Wickwire's face.
