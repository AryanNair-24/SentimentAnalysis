22) 7) dialog: The sun and moon... the ebb and flow of the Pacific tides... global warming... the very angle of the Earth upon its axis... these are just some of the things I control in my world. Trainees swap private looks.
23) 3) dialog: You may think that you are the brightest, the best, the strongest. I assure you, that is a total delusion on your part.  It is my job to show you just how weak human beings can truly be.  60 percent of you will not finish this course. How do I know?  Because that is an historical fact. It's also intimidating shit.
23) 4) dialog: Poles down. The earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the dam sand.  Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh batteries into his bullhorn.  He does it like a man thumbing rounds into a shotgun.
23) 5) dialog: Now for the bad new:  I always like to get one quitter on the first day. And until I do, the first day does not end.  So look around right now -- go on, do it.  I wonder who it's gonna be... He passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes. INSTRUCTOR PYRO steps up.  He's the Chief's bulldog.
23) 17) dialog: Now make like sugar cookies and roll in the sand for me. The trainees hit their bellies and roll.  Indeed, they look like sugar cookies.
23) 18) dialog: Collect those poles, gentlemen. Still a lotta beachfront you haven't seen... Groaning, the trainees grab poles.  Jordan's pole, wet slips from their collective grasp... And bangs Stamm's ankle.  He HOWLS through his teeth.
24) 1) dialog: Pain is your friend.  You ally.  It will keep you awake in times of emergency... it will tell you when you are seriously injured... it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home.  But you know the best thing about pain?
24) 3) dialog: It lets you know that you aren't dead yet. Instructors roam, RASPING ORDERS, kicking students into proper position.  Jordan struggles with the reverses.
24) 9) dialog: Who's it gonna be.  I just wonder, who is it gonna be...
27) 1) dialog: You have noticed a ship's bell hanging at the west side of this courtyard.  If, at any time, you feel you cannot continue with your training -- that bell is your salvation.  Strike it three times, and the ordeal is over. Nervous eyes flick to the bell.
27) 2) dialog: Yes, it is a long walk.  So I'll make it as easy as I can. He turns his back to the class.
27) 3) dialog: Now you don't have to watch me watching you break rank.  Because I know someone here wants to do it. CAMERA SEARCHES their faces.  There isn't one trainee her who hasn't thought about it.  Including Jordan.
27) 4) dialog: Now I know what you're thinking...
27) 7) dialog: "Can I really take 15 weeks of this bubonic asshole?"  If you don't know the answer to that question, the answer is "No, you cannot."  And that is another historical fact.  So do it.  Admit you don't have what it takes... admit you are out of your depth -- or we're all heading back to the beach right now. (waiting a beat)
27) 8) text: Instructors!  Time hack! Following the Chief's lead, Instructors lift their dive watches.
27) 9) dialog: Six... five... four... three... two... one... HACK! (to class)
29) 0) text: QUICK CLOSEUPS of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to watch someone cross the grinder.  At least we know who it isn't. CLOSE on the Chief as the BELL RINGS THREE TIMES.  He turns around to find... Stamm at the bell. For the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan. Was he expecting her?
29) 1) dialog: Leave your helmet there, Stamm. Back to the barracks. Stamm drops his helmet and limps away.
29) 2) dialog: The rest of you should remember one thing.  The only easy day was today. Lieutenant Wickwire?  Turning it over to you.
33) 2) dialog: England, 88 seconds.  You're good to go for the slide-for-life. Wickwire, roll back till you get south of 90.
33) 16) dialog: Cortez, 93 seconds.  O'Neil, 94. Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery on your gonads and line up again. O'Neil... move ahead. Heading back to the starting line, Jordan wheels around.
33) 18) dialog: You heard me.  Move on.
33) 21) dialog: Educate her, Pyro.
33) 24) dialog: Twice now, I have said the words "move on." He turns his back, leaving no possibility of discussion. Jordan stares after.
46) 3) dialog: Body heat.  In situations of extreme cold, you can always count on body heat to keep you alive -- and I do not mean your own.  We will break you of the cultural barriers that dictate you should not invade another man's space.  Are any of you in a situation of extreme cold right now? INTERCUTTING trainees and instructors:
46) 5) dialog: Then why aren't you all over the man next to you? The class pivots 90 degrees and starts to close rank. Behind Jordan, Montgomery (a.k.a. "Flea") hesitates: He's a bantam-weight from Georgia, his manners bred into the bone.  He just can't find a delicate way to grab Jordan without mounting her.
46) 20) dialog: Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast. CAMERA POLLS the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water. Jordan feels Flea starting to shake.  Badly.
46) 31) dialog: Remember, all this is completely voluntary.  For any of you who don't want to continue, Instructor Johns is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance. A portable light comes on.  Indeed, an instructor is setting up coffee service.
46) 32) dialog: Any takers?
46) 43) dialog: You want another minute to think about this?  Huh? (no response; to Miller directly)
46) 45) dialog: Johnson.  Get 'em out of my scan. It's a death sentence.  As the quitters slouch for the coffee truck...
46) 47) dialog: (into bullhorn)
47) 3) dialog: Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
53) 1) dialog: Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
53) 3) dialog: Boat Six -- England, O'Neil, McCool, Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik. Lieutenant England is your senior officer. Jordan rolls her eyes:  At least two of the guys in her crew are blue-ribbon misogynists.  Cortez and Slutnik don't like it any better.
53) 7) dialog: (looking up)
53) 12) dialog: Boat Seven...
56) 4) dialog: Your boat just hit razor coral. What do you do now?
68) 1) dialog: Crew Six!  Stand by!
72) 0) text: At the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the boat's wake.
72) 1) dialog: (to pilot)
74) 1) dialog: You know, the Israelis... Jordan recoils.  Christ, how long has he been there?  Jus standing in the doorway?
74) 2) dialog: ... they tried women in the 1967 War.  Female soldiers. With forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds towel.
74) 4) dialog: It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
74) 7) dialog: For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
74) 9) dialog: Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant? She can't say yes.  She wants to but can't.
74) 10) dialog: Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
74) 12) dialog: England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
74) 15) dialog: You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer. (passing her on his way out)
112) 1) dialog: What is your father's name? Jordan seated.  Prowling the hut is her interrogator.  He tormentor.  Her chaperon through Hell.
112) 2) dialog: Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
112) 4) dialog: Any brothers?  Sisters?
112) 6) dialog: Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
112) 8) dialog: You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
112) 10) dialog: Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh? It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid. Continuing the psychological strip-search:
112) 11) dialog: Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
112) 13) dialog: She led us right to you.  That's no threat? Jordan rubs her head.  So long ago.  How did the call com down?
112) 14) dialog: Would you have shot if it was a man?
112) 16) dialog: The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
112) 18) dialog: That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
112) 20) dialog: I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
112) 22) dialog: You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil? She stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question.
112) 23) dialog: Do you?
112) 25) dialog: I'm so glad we agree. With stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes her out the door...
113) 0) text: ... and throws her onto a table. In the pens, all faces turn to watch.  Even instructors stop what they're doing as... The Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind her.
113) 1) dialog: Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
113) 3) dialog: I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect. He flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open her pants.
113) 5) dialog: (to the men)
113) 8) text: Someone's trippin' out here... The Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty face.
113) 9) dialog: Three crews are still on this island somewhere.  Who knows where? The men trade itchy looks.  Some do know.
113) 11) dialog: Who's gonna tell me?  Who's gonna be chivalrous and stop this abuse? What, you want to see her get mauled?  Is that it? The men shift anxiously.  Should they talk?  Behind the Chief, Jordan staggers to her feet.
113) 13) dialog: (waving them back)
113) 16) dialog: (for her ears only)
113) 20) dialog: (to instructors)
114) 0) text: The Chief chucks gear onto a transport boat.  FOOTSTEPS approach.  He knows it's Pyro.
114) 1) dialog: You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
114) 3) dialog: I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
114) 5) dialog: She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
114) 7) dialog: Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
114) 9) dialog: I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
124) 3) dialog: Stand fast! McCool and Flea jerk to a stop:  The Chief has emerged from the instructor's office.  Helpless, they watch as... Jordan mounts the stairs to the bell... takes up the baton... and HITS THE BELL like a tyko drummer. RING ONE:  On the pained faces of her crewmates. RING TWO:  On the Chief.  Taking no joy in it.  Just accepting it as inevitable.
130) 8) text: "John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
145) 8) dialog: Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
145) 10) dialog: Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
147) 1) dialog: (setting watch)
147) 3) dialog: Final assignment!  Each crew will be dropped 12 miles out!  Between you and the shore is a network of mines and underwater obstacles!  You will clear the obstacles, you will tag the mines with your crew number! You have until 18-hundred to make landfall!
149) 1) dialog: Remember!  The one thing you can count on in any mission is that anything mechanical will fail!  If you get stuck out here, do not call me, for you will no longer be in my class!  Try the Coast Guard! The HELO PILOT slows to five knots.  The Chief gives Jordan the go-ahead nod.
150) 0) text: The ILB splashes down into the ocean.  Jordan's crew helo casts in after it. From the door of the circling helo, the Chief watches as... Jordan's crew swims to the ILB, bobbing in the swells. Flea turns a handle on the CO2 tank meant to inflate the boat.  Nothing happens.
151) 1) dialog: What happening?!
156) 3) dialog: Base, this is Basher One.  I've got a small problem here.  Do you copy? Jaws drop.
158) 1) dialog: Got one other heartbeat here, looks touch and go.  I've got a questionable leg.
159) 1) dialog: Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
159) 3) dialog: Say again?  How many micks?
160) 1) dialog: (into radio)
161) 4) text: Chief -- did I see a flare box aboard?  And can you get at it? Over.
163) 1) dialog: Got it.
163) 3) text: Show us where you are, Chief.
165) 4) dialog: O'Neil... there's no air in your main tanks.
166) 1) dialog: (into radio)
168) 1) dialog: Why'd it have to be her...
170) 2) dialog: (unbuckling co-pilot)
175) 0) text: ... and "Supermans" into daylight with the Chief.  They covered 50 feet in four seconds. Doing a 360, Jordan spots... Seafox One coming their way. Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim. Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place: They're wasting no time on the pick-up. Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a death-grip on the Chief's vest.
175) 1) dialog: (growling)
