46) 11) text: Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
46) 12) dialog: It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
46) 14) dialog: No, ma'am.
46) 16) dialog: I'll work on it, ma'am.
46) 22) dialog: 'Snot me.  It's him. Two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's shuddering.  Jordan feels him shaking through Flea.
46) 29) dialog: How you doin', Miller?  Miller? No answer.  Bad sign.  On shore:
46) 35) dialog: Look like donuts to me...
58) 0) text: Jordan and Flea fill sand bags to shore up the walls of their hide-site.  England and McCool shovel back to back.
73) 0) text: COUGHING up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward McCool and Flea.  They make textbook recoveries.  She's the only one who couldn't cut it.
87) 8) dialog: Clear. SCOPE POV:  Of the FAVs disappearing down the road.
87) 13) dialog: Don't wanna evacuate 'cuz someone came down with uric poisoning, el- tee. Abruptly Jordan unzips, drops her pants, sticks the pot under her.  It raises eyebrows:  It's a far cry from when she was covering up in cold water.
91) 4) dialog: What's the word, el-tee?  We're about one minute from a major take- down here. HOLD on Jordan, heart skipping.  Did she really make the wrong call?
92) 0) text: They come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts, splintering into three groups and laying down SUPPRESSIVE FIRE as they blitz for... The woodlands. "Hostiles" FIRE and pursue. Flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath him.  He goes down like a doped race horse.  Suddenly exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:  Flea ran right over their hide-site. Slutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet.
93) 0) text: Breathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the link-up site just inside the woods.  Flea comes in hobbling.  Badly.
93) 4) dialog: Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
102) 0) text: A P.O.W. camp, disturbingly authentic.  A dozen trainees are already here, held in pens of bamboo and barbed-wire. Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry -- all five get tossed into a pen.  Jordan is pulled away.
102) 1) dialog: Where are you... HEY!  Where are you taking her?
105) 0) text: As "hostiles" pull Flea out of the pen.
111) 0) text: Legs hobbled, uniform soiled, Jordan is led past a row of huts.  She looks like she got hit by a train -- and got back up. JORDAN'S POV:  Vision still blown out.  But inside the pen, we make out 40 trainees now.  One guy wrings out a sock and drinks from it. Jordan moves past huts.  VOLATILE VOICES spill out as trainees get interrogated. JORDAN'S POV:  Outside one hut, we see Flea.  At least we think it's him:  Strapped face-down to a table, sobbing quietly, he wears a slinky dress and whore's makeup.  The broke him -- and it's an ugly, ugly sight.
113) 21) text: We're done here. Beaten, he walks right out of camp. Wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes. Wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight.  But this time he made it. A medic tries to help Jordan, but she pushes him away, walking drunkenly for... Flea.  She begins wiping the makeup from his face.
124) 0) text: McCool and Flea exit a classroom with other trainees. They spot Jordan approaching.
124) 2) dialog: Oh, no... no, no, no, no... They lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way.
147) 2) text: Four... three... two... one... hack! Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry, Jordan.  Inside the airborne helo, they synchronize their dive watches.
150) 0) text: The ILB splashes down into the ocean.  Jordan's crew helo casts in after it. From the door of the circling helo, the Chief watches as... Jordan's crew swims to the ILB, bobbing in the swells. Flea turns a handle on the CO2 tank meant to inflate the boat.  Nothing happens.
150) 1) dialog: C'mon, c'mon... Cortez tries to help.  The handle spins in his grip.
154) 4) dialog: Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for? Cortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the ILB, inflating it.  The crew scrambles aboard.  Jordan digs like a dog to find a radio.
155) 0) text: The ILB powers over swells.  Flea is perched on the bow, nose to the wind like a hunting dog.
155) 1) dialog: 
155) 3) dialog: Close as I can get, el-tee!
161) 1) dialog: If we could just fix on him...
165) 1) dialog: Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
