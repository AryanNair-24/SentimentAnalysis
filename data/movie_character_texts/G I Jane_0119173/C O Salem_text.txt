1) 10) text: You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
1) 17) text: In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.

6) 0) text: Winterscape:  Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow, morning water calm.  There's an almost hallowed beauty to it all.  Soon we pick out... A spot of day-glo.  Coming out of the mouth of morning. Overtaking the floes. CLOSER on JORDAN O'NEIL.  She pushes her flat-water kayak downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time. Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington bridge, she passes... Cars overhead.  Grid-locked by snow conditions. In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument. Something BURRS from a life-vest pocket.  She rips throug velcro to free a cell phone.
9) 0) text: Bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian employees transit a security station on their way inside. Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and balancing a collapsed kayak on her head.  She flashes a photo-badge and double-times inside.
10) 0) text: Jordan exits a locker room.  Smoothing out her Khaki uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock doors.  Falling in step:
11) 0) text: A circular chamber.  Dominating the ground floor is the bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations.  On the second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen.
12) 5) text: High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
13) 0) text: On the phone, Jordan glances around.  Co-workers mull within earshot.  Those out of earshot post E-mail memos o Jordan's computer:  "Moving up in life."  "I want a full report."  "Don't tell her who you really voted for."
15) 0) text: It's not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room In the kitchen we find... A naked man.  He's steeping tea.
16) 17) text: So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
17) 0) text: Jordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead. A flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge. Suddenly two NAVY HELOS BLAST overhead, scattering the pelicans.
18) 0) text: On base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt courtyard.  The is "the grinder," reminiscent of a gladiator's arena.  She notices at one end... A silver ship's bell.  Hung prominently.
19) 3) text: So you're the one. Hearing, other workers look up.  Among them is a female ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no concession to her sex.  Throughout, she'll watch Jordan with more than passing interest.
20) 1) dialog: Come. A YEOMAN opens the door.  Behind him is Jordan.
20) 3) dialog: Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
20) 5) dialog: Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
20) 7) dialog: So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
20) 10) dialog: Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
20) 12) dialog: I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
20) 14) dialog: Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed. Another smile, another phantom gesture on the back of her chair.  If Jordan was expecting a fight, the bell never sounded.  She rises, salutes -- then turns back at the door.
20) 16) dialog: If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we? (a beat)
21) 0) text: The Spec-Recon TRAINEES loiter outside their open rooms, pumping weights, hosing down dive gear, trading Walkman tapes.  This is the last day of liberty they'll have for long time.

22) 3) dialog: That is all that will be said about the special nature of this class -- by us or by you.  Many of you have waited years for admission to this program.  Opportunities like this are rare -- and those who seize upon them are rarer still. He approaches Jordan.  We can tell what she's thinking. "Just keep moving.  Don't single me out."
22) 4) dialog: Other than that, there is little to be said but "Good luck, gentleman." (correcting)
22) 6) dialog: Now I turn you over to the chief training officer.  He has earned six naval commendations, the purple heart, and the Navy Cross for heroism and valor.  I give you Master Chief John James Urgayle. Taking over, THE CHIEF stands before the class a moment, sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him too:  His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50. An ageless warrior.  Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs in this guy's veins. The Chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo - and it's anything but the kick-ass rant the class is expecting:
27) 6) text: I'm thinkin' we could jump him right now...
30) 0) text: Dead-ass tired, Jordan slides her tray down the line, piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories. She heads for... A table of trainees, one spot open.  Seeing her coming, the guys shift position.  Suddenly the table is full.
32) 0) text: Two beds.  Matching lockers.  A desk, a chair, a mirror. All overwhelmingly dull. Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory of her body.  Both sides of her neck are bruised from the phone-pole run.  Her back and thighs are sand-burned. Mirror cuts abound.  She's already a mess. Jordan uncaps some cologne.  It's a vestige of her old life she's not going to surrender.  She sniffs.  Savors. Dabs.  Looks back in the mirror... And breaks out laughing.  It's like dropping a rose in a cesspool.
33) 0) text: A PHOTOGRAPHER stands near a car parked just outside the base.  He's peering through a 600mm lens. PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV:  FOCUSING through cyclone fencing... PANNING past the sand dunes... and finding green-clad trainees gathered at an obstacle course.

39) 4) dialog: (jolted)
39) 7) dialog: Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
39) 9) dialog: Did you just have a brain-fart?
39) 11) dialog: Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
39) 13) dialog: (building)
39) 15) text: But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
39) 17) dialog: No, sir, WHAT?
39) 19) dialog: Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language. (a beat)
39) 22) dialog: Straight up?

44) 11) text: Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file. Slutnik stalks out.  Jordan fires a look at the innocent bystander here, McCool.  He was studying at his desk when the fireworks began.
46) 44) text: Do any of you want to reconsider? Avoiding his eyes, Miller wags his head.
46) 48) text: Everybody out. With a SHIVERING CHEER, the trainees stampede ashore, grabbing blankets, trading body-bumps and high-fives. Jordan gets swept up in the esprit:  They've conquered a common enemy.  But when she tries to get high-fived... The guys turn their backs.  It's a cold rebuff, worse the any water. HOLD TIGHT on Jordan.  Shivering.  Watching the guys drif away.  Hating them.

51) 0) text: The C.O. double-takes as Jordan enters:  She's sun-burned wind-burned, sand-burned, chapped and chaffed, bloody and soggy.  Her dive suit leaks onto the floor.
51) 2) dialog: You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant? He tosses her the paper.  Jordan scans the article as DeHaven continues over speakerphone:
51) 4) text: This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
51) 5) dialog: Your prerogative, Senator.

72) 2) text: Next recovery!  Keep goin', keep goin'!

You're an inferior soldier, a bad officer, and I don't want you learning that inconvenient truth when you're stuck in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy lines and don't know how the fuck to get out.  You get out now, O'Neil. Seek life elsewhere.  And if you can't do it in front of me, do it behind my back. Pinning her down with just his eyes, he rises -- and starts away.

123) 25) dialog: I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed. Jordan moves to the door.  Again she makes eye-contact with Blondell.  Now we understand why she's so scared: There's a witch-hunt brewing.

145) 3) dialog: And unless that someone takes the honorable way out in the next 10 seconds -- I will make certain he faces action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell.  He slows when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows would be inadequate.
