Last night our top three stories were twenty-three dead in the Middle East, boring, Earthquake in Asia, seen it before, car crash on the M5, blah blah blah. We are making ‘olds’. We need to flip the switch, mix it up. I want to nutri bullet the shit out of the news. Richard leans across to Bridget and Miranda.

We have a presentation in twelve weeks at the London Media Show and I need someone dynamic, innovative and focused to lead the charge. Any volunteers? In a fit of enthusiasm Bridget thrusts up her hand, she i the only person to do so. Everybody looks stunned, includ Alice, who chooses not to acknowledge her.

48) 10) dialog: Do you need the loo Bridget?

53) 3) dialog: What?... I’m relying on you Bridget. I need you to get this right. Understand?
55) 2) dialog: I have to say Bridget, I’m actually excited about this next guest. Relevant, relatable and extremely fuckable. Good work.

80) 9) dialog: Is it that presentation?
80) 11) dialog: Sorry doesn’t cut it, I seriously have to question whether there is a place for you at Hard News... To her horror, she now sees Ariyaratna intercepting his h Jack Quant and introducing him to Mark Darcy.
111) 2) dialog: On balance I would suggest ‘can’t’ considering I just found General Lu Tong in the lobby, and his chauffeur is currently live on air answering questions about Burmese human rights violations. Good job!

112) 2) dialog: I’m not firing her for being pregnant. I’m firing her for gross incompetency.
112) 4) dialog: How about for interviewing a chauffeur instead of a General, publicly insulting the CEO of the London Media Show, using a TV interview to determine if a guest might be the father of her child and being responsible for broadcast of 36 bare arses.
