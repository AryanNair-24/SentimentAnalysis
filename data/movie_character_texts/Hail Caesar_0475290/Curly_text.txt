39) 1) dialog: It wasn't my fault you saw me take the pie off the sill Miz McGraw.
39) 3) dialog: Why, that crazy full moon! Two weeks ago you'd a never seen me take it! Laughter from the audience as Curly stomps over to the ma playing guitar: Hobie, relaxing on a tipped-back chair on bunkhouse porch.

39) 6) dialog: Durn you! You turned Curly Strimlin over to the authorities for the last time! We cut over his shoulder: he is addressing a reflection o the moon in a watering trough. He now dives in with hands outstretched as if to throttle the reflection. Hobie sings on. Curly sits up in the trough sputtering an looks around, stymied and irate.
