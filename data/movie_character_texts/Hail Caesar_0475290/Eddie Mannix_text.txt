Joan Van Vechten is playing Dierdre, but we need a male lead and we need him now... No, Jack Hogarth is drying out at Cedars... Metro won’t lend us Gable unless we give them the Comiskey Twins... Of course not, I agree... Swell idea but he’s waiting out a divorce in Reno... Whuh—Hobie Doyle?! Do you really think so? After all he’s—he’s a dust actor! The man barely knows how to... talk!... Yes, of course, Mr. Schenk, I agree, but I don’t know if Hobie Doyle, if he has the uh the uh the uh poise in a dinner jacket... Yes, we do need someone pronto... No I don’t. That’s very true.

But I’m sure you appreciate also that great masses of humanity look to pictures for information and uplift and, yes, entertainment. Now here at Capitol Pictures, as you know, an army of technicians and actors and top-notch artistic people are working hard to bring to the screen the story of the Christ. It’s a swell story—a story told before, yes, but we like to flatter ourselves that it’s never been told with this kind of distinction and panache.
8) 3) dialog: Quite right, Padre. The Bible of course is terrific. (MORE )

8) 12) dialog: A kid we're all very excited about, Todd Hocheiser, wonderful young actor we found in Akron, Ohio, in a nationwide talent hunt. But Hocheiser is seen only fleetingly, and with extreme taste; our story is told through the eyes of a Roman tribune, Autolochus Antoninus, an ordinary man skeptical at first but who comes to a grudging respect for this swell figure from the East. And Autolochus is played by... He permits himself a satisfied smile. «+. Baird Whitlock. 19. Murmurs of appreciation from the assembled and one low “that’s-something” whistle.
8) 14) dialog: Now Hail, Cesar! is a prestige picture, our biggest release of the year, and we are devoting huge resources to its production in order to make it first-class in every respect. Gentlemen, given its enormous expense, we don’t want to send it to market except in the certainty that it will not offend any reasonable American, regardless of faith or creed. Now that’s where you come in. You’ve read the script; I wanna know if the theological elements of the story are up to snuff.
8) 16) dialog: Uh-huh, well, we can look at that. But as for the, uh, religious aspect—does the depiction of Christ Jesus cut the mustard?
8) 18) dialog: How so, Father?
8) 25) dialog: But Rabbi, we all have a little bit of God in us don’t we?

14) 14) dialog: We've offered you some very suitable, clean young men.
14) 17) dialog: The marriage doesn’t have to last forever. But, DeeAnna, having a child without a father would present a public relations problem for the studio. The aquatic pictures do very nicely for us, and—
14) 19) dialog: The pictures do well for all of us. And it’s a tribute to you: the public loves you because they know how innocent you are. Let me see if Arne is open to, um... matrimony. You're sure he’s the father?
17) 4) dialog: That we’re looking for him. But we don’t want it in the gossip columns—Baird on a bender or ina love nest or wherever we end up finding him. As far as the set is concerned it’s business as usual. Tell the A.D. Baird is out briefly with a high ankle sprain.

27) 8) dialog: What?! She gives him a knowing look and a confirming nod.
27) 10) dialog: First of all—first of all—first of all—there’s nothing to that story. I’ve heard it, it’s been around forever, and it’s never been confirmed. And secondly—you can’t print that! Even if you could print it you couldn’t print it. And you wouldn’t want to, Thora, it’s beneath you.
27) 14) dialog: People don’t want the facts, they want to believe. That’s our great industry—mine, and yours too. They want to believe that Baird Whitlock is a great star, and a good man. 56.

27) 25) dialog: Do they care about Carlotta Valdez? They’re sweet on each other. You should see the two of ‘em together, peas in a pod.
27) 27) dialog: You're not trading anything, you’re waiting one day on a story that’s years old. Give me a day, I can let you talk to Baird and show you your story’s the bunk. And if I’m wrong, no skin off your nose, you run the column. In the meantime you have an exclusive—no one else knows about Hobie and Carlotta. Thora eyes him suspiciously.
27) 29) dialog: You're it. Eddie treats the deal as done in hopes that that will hel make it so. He smiles at her.

55) 14) dialog: Good morning. Sorry about last night, Thora—didn’t know your sister would show up. 109.
55) 16) dialog: Thora, I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Thora smiles thinly.

56) 0) text: Thora and Eddie seat themselves at a curved stone bench beneath a stone table upon which Eddie puts the flowers. Behind them is a building that says WARDROBE. A Roman centurion sits against its exterior wall lacing up his sandals’ calf straps. Others emerge from the building one a time, each cinching up the chin strap on his bristle-to helmet or giving the bottom of his breastplate a tug or i some other way making ready.
56) 1) dialog: I’m telling you not to run the column, Thora, for your own good. A hoot from Thora.
56) 3) dialog: And you think this'll cinch it for you. 110.
56) 5) dialog: We've all heard the story. But here’s something you haven’t heard: your source is a Communist. If you print it, it’ll be dismissed as a Commie smear tactic—and you'll be dismissed as a Commie stooge. Her smile starts to fade. EDDIE (CONT’D) Burt Gurney has left the country and the cell he was part of has been smashed by the police. You might’ve thought he was credible because he’s Mr. Laurentz’s current... protegé, but—you don’t want to be seen as Burt Gurney’s mouthpiece after this. Thora’s look curdles. A beat.
56) 7) dialog: Talked to Laurence late last night, put two and two together. (rises, indicating flowers) Well, no need to send this since I ran into you.

57) 5) dialog: I don’t know, Father. I snuck another cigarette. Or two. I didn’t make it home in time for dinner. And I, uh... I struck a movie star in anger. A sigh from the unseen priest.
57) 7) dialog: Okay. Okay. Father... Eddie is struggling.
57) 9) dialog: May I ask you something, Father?
