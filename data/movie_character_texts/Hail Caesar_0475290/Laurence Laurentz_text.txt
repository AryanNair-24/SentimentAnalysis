16) 0) text: People in formal-wear lounge, chatting. Hobie Doyle enters stiffly in a tuxedo. He tugs at his collar. A distinguished-looking man, middle-aged, well dressed bu not in wardrobe, hastens to greet Hobie. He is the direct Laurence Laurentz.
16) 1) dialog: My dear boy, you look wonderful, how do you feel?
16) 3) dialog: No no, nicely fit, looks a marvel, just takes a little getting used to. Now you enter here, Hobie, having just seen Biff’s valise in the foyer—in spite of Allegra’s claim that he hasn’t been to the house.
16) 5) dialog: Indeed you are.
16) 7) dialog: Indeed you have. And so here we find you haunted by unspoken suspicions.
16) 9) dialog: By his valise, yes, but then here is Dierdre, (indicates actress on couch who coldly examines Hobie—a veteran with no patience for the rookies) «+. harboring deep feelings for you, and sensing opportunity. 30.
16) 11) dialog: Dierdre, yes. So at her importuning, you join her on the couch, and conversation ensues. Hobie is concerned.
16) 13) dialog: Laurentz.
16) 15) dialog: She'll simply ask you to join her on the couch, is all I mean to say, and conversation ensues.
16) 17) dialog: Very good, very good, let’s try one shall we?
16) 19) dialog: Wonderful, splendid. (turns away but turns back with a thought) The only thing I would suggest is, before your first line, you respond to her line with a mirthless chuckle.
16) 21) dialog: Yes, given your unspoken suspicions about Allegra, a mirthless chuckle. 31.
16) 23) dialog: Laurentz.
16) 29) text: A beat, the actress looking at him, Hobie looking at the floor. The beat grows longer... longer... Voice of Laurence Laurentz: “Cut!” 32. We cut to Laurence Laurentz sitting in his director’s cha mouth slightly open, staring without expression as he tri to frame his notes. He abruptly rises and walks into the set to join Hobie.
16) 30) dialog: Very good—wonderful in fact. But let's try it a little differently this time—
16) 32) dialog: —let’s try, well let’s see, first of all why don’t we dispense with the mirthless chuckle.
16) 34) dialog: No, no need, really—it was a bad idea, bad directorial—my fault, overthinking the thing.
16) 36) dialog: No no no, completely unnecessary under the circumstances, I think the audience can to that extent read your thoughts, and will assume your mirthlessness.
16) 38) dialog: Laurentz.
16) 40) dialog: Also, let’s try, this time, actually looking at Dierdre as we speak, looking into her eyes, and speaking our line with a certain... ruefulness. Hobie nods agreement.
16) 42) dialog: Yes. Because it’s not so simple. Not so simple as she suggests.
16) 44) dialog: Your feelings are not so simple.
16) 46) dialog: Splendid.
16) 51) dialog: Good, very good. Wonderful, in fact. Let’s try, this time... He balls a fist and brings it to his mouth and stares at floor, thinking. Hobie waits, gazing up at him. At length: LAURENCE LAURENTZ (CONT’D) All right, let’s try this, your line, just say it as I say it, say your line exactly as I’m about to. Just as I’m about to do.
16) 53) dialog: (rueful, and British- accented) Would that it’were so simple.
16) 55) dialog: My dear boy, why do you say that—why do you say, “twuuuuuh”?
16) 57) dialog: Yes but—
16) 59) dialog: Would that it’were so simple.
16) 61) dialog: Would that it’were so simple.
16) 63) dialog: Laurence.
16) 65) dialog: We can use Christian names, my good dear boy. Laurence is fine—
16) 67) dialog: —yust as I call you Hobie. So, “Would that it’were so simple.” Trippingly.
16) 69) dialog: You seem to be lingering, it’s interminable—
16) 71) dialog: —I'm wondering when it’1l end, the “were,” and we shouldn’t have to wonder, should we, we should be marching right along to “so simple”! 36.
16) 73) dialog: Would that it were so simple. Not “simple!” Just... (relaxed) simmple.
16) 75) dialog: Larry! Good God, Christian names, yes, but not Larry.
17) 26) dialog: Mannix, I won’t have it! For two decades the name “Laurence Laurentz” has meant something to the public!
17) 28) dialog: Hobie Doyle cannot act!
17) 30) dialog: On horseback! But this is drama, Mannix—real drama, an adaptation of a Broadway smash! It requires the skills of a trained thespian, not a rodeo clown. I begged you for Lunt! Natalie has been hesitant to butt in:
17) 33) dialog: Oh, he’s game. And gamey!
35) 5) dialog: Grease-marks on the print form a V that indicates a fade down. As waltz music comes up, an inverted V grease-mark indica a fade up on a shot of the dancing feet of many people, g swirling, tuxedoed legs debonairly stepping. Supered on the shot:
