11) 1) dialog: Aware as a wary woman will be of a strange man's presence without necessarily having looked at him.  Well aware too that he stayed where he was -- so she unworriedly unlocks building's security gate and goes through to the inner --
11) 3) dialog: You're Jenny's father. And the recognition on his part:
11) 5) dialog: You look alike.
11) 8) dialog: Not her brand.
11) 10) text: Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop. Elaine doesn't soften.
11) 11) dialog: Why did you come here?
11) 13) dialog: No, why did you come here? America.
11) 15) dialog: Been busy, have you.
11) 17) dialog: It's been a while.
11) 19) dialog: That's not what I heard.
11) 21) dialog: I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
11) 23) dialog: In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
11) 25) dialog: And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
11) 28) dialog: Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you. She turns to walk away.
11) 30) dialog: (without looking back)
11) 31) text: Try calling me again. INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  EVENING. She comes in.  A modest studio apartment.  Puts her bag o the kitchenette countertop.  Glances at her answer machin see if she has any messages.  The phone RINGS.  She sits glumly on her couch, holds her head in her hands. EXT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING.

12) 2) dialog: Sounds like Beverly Hills.
12) 4) dialog: Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
12) 6) dialog: (has he seen it?)
12) 10) dialog: Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. (blinks coquettishly)
12) 13) dialog: Now who's being sarcastic?
12) 15) dialog: I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. (raises her drink)
12) 17) dialog: It's a kind of prison, doing a series. Early to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts. (the kicker)
12) 20) dialog: Not embarrassed.
12) 23) dialog: Not ashamed. Wilson looks at her.  Okay.  What then.
12) 24) dialog: Disappointed.
12) 26) dialog: She never told anyone else. (making light now)
12) 29) dialog: When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
12) 31) dialog: Modelling.
12) 34) text: Show up the old man, you know. Elaine smiles slightly.  None of this information new to But warming to this man.
12) 35) dialog: You weren't disappointed in her, then.
12) 37) dialog: She was twenty-one when she came to me. (looks at him)
12) 40) dialog: She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't. It's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here. Looks at Elaine.
13) 1) dialog: When did you get in?
13) 3) dialog: (occurs to her)
13) 6) dialog: I might've been away for the weekend.
13) 8) dialog: And you've seen Eddie Rama.
13) 10) dialog: I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
13) 12) dialog: I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
13) 14) dialog: Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
13) 16) dialog: The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
13) 18) dialog: What's that, like a P.O. box.
13) 20) dialog: Where you get your bank statements. Wilson gives a laugh.
13) 22) dialog: Some word. Wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean.  So of WAVES gently lapping the beach.
13) 24) dialog: (watching him)
14) 1) dialog: Make yourself at home.  Steal something. That gets her a look.
14) 2) dialog: There's nothing I can't afford to lose. She goes to make coffee.  Wilson looks around.
14) 3) dialog: Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
14) 5) dialog: Rock n' roll, is what we called it.  He's sort of a forgotten figure now, but back when the West Coast was the grooviest place on earth, Terry Valentine was where all the happenings happened.  More of a kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that means.  Just took that whole Southern California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with it.  Packaged and sold it.  Made out like a bandit. <i>FLASH CUTS: VALENTINE. At home. Watching as Adhara undresses, either deliberately for him, or just casually. She smiles as she notices he's looking.</i>
14) 7) dialog: (brings a tray over)
14) 10) dialog: -- Your employer?
14) 12) dialog: Who's Mr. Lindgren?
14) 14) dialog: What line is he in.
14) 16) dialog: I see.
14) 18) dialog: I bet.
14) 20) dialog: I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
14) 22) dialog: (she gets the picture)
14) 25) dialog: In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
14) 27) dialog: -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him. They sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- sit down.  Coffee steaming.
14) 28) dialog: So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
14) 30) dialog: Are you serious.
14) 32) dialog: You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
14) 34) dialog: You don't believe it was a car accident.
14) 36) dialog: Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
14) 38) dialog: On what.  What makes you so certain.
14) 40) dialog: There's the phone.  You want his number.
14) 43) dialog: Past caring.
14) 44) dialog: I'm not going to help you. She goes into a bathroom.  Shutting the door behind her.

21) 1) dialog: I was in the neighborhood.  I come down here quite a bit.  Watch the planes taking off. (re this motel)
21) 2) text: Study the architecture of early David Lynch. But she doesn't really have it in her to be ironic right Leans back against the door. Wilson remains silent.  He's done the same to Elaine now he did to Ed.  Almost magically induced her to a confessi verge. Elaine, too, isn't sure she wants to be complicit in this revenge tragedy.  But here goes:
21) 3) dialog: Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
21) 5) dialog: She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming straight to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive. She looks at Wilson.  Shrugs.  That's it.  That's all.  I it?
21) 8) dialog: You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.

23) 6) dialog: These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide? Wilson looks at her:  she's the one who goes to bed with cons.
23) 8) dialog: You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
23) 10) dialog: It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. (quickly)
23) 13) dialog: Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
23) 15) dialog: What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
23) 17) dialog: You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
23) 19) dialog: It didn't discourage you, though.
23) 21) dialog: From pursuing your chosen profession.
23) 23) dialog: I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
