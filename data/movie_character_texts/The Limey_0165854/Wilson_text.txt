13) 23) dialog: I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
13) 26) dialog: Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.

14) 31) dialog: Have you ever known me not to be. Elaine looks away:
14) 33) dialog: What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
14) 35) dialog: What do you think.

17) 29) dialog: On the deck outside.  Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out with a plate of food.  What Wilson can't belleve when he it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top o high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon.

Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck, presses it out under his shoe.  Limbers up his shoulders subtle way. Gordon coming towards him.  As if to challenge Wilson's legitimacy as an invited guest.  Closer.  About to speak. But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.  In quick succession:  Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him ov the railing! It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp wh they saw. INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her Girlfriend.  When he glances back to the deck he's a litt concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore -- just Wilson coming back in.
