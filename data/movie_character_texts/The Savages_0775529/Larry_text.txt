51) 22) dialog: Wendy?... Wendy?
51) 24) dialog: Wendy, c’mon. How about I drive up and bring’ Genghis? We can spend the afternoon together. It’1l be fun. (Wendy doesn't answer) I know it’s not the greatest offer in the world, but it’s something. I’d love to be more of a support, but you know my situation

60) 21) dialog: Wendy's told me a lot about you. Jon nods. LARRY (CONT’D) I loved your essay on “Mother Courage,” by the way. Wendy showed it to me. I did a production of it and it was a huge help. Jon smiles stiffly -- he’s not buying this flattery. Wendy takes the hint.
60) 24) dialog: He seems really nice. Wendy climbs in and notices an unhealthy PLANT poking out of a box in the backseat.
61) 0) text: Larry's car is parked out front.
62) 0) text: Larry and Wendy are making out. Genghis and Marley have found spots for themselves, far from the action. Wendy suddenly pulls away from Larry.

62) 6) dialog: I'm sorry. She heaves an agitated sigh.
62) 8) dialog: Of what? Wendy looks at him squarely. 84.
62) 10) dialog: I know this isn’t perfect.
62) 13) dialog: What cliché?

62) 20) dialog: You're thirty-nine.
62) 22) dialog: So?

62) 25) dialog: I mean, you're not my little student. It's not like we've got “The Blue Angel” going on here. The comment just lands there oddly. Wendy cocks her head the side and makes an exaggerated expression of confusion

62) 33) dialog: Why do you do this?
62) 35) dialog: You do it all the time. And on top of it, you insult me by telling me I’m the one having a mid-life crisis here, when you're the one having an affair with a married guy instead of seeking real intimacy with someone who is available for a real commitment. And you know it’s all about your father. Wendy is stunned, but keeps going. 124 125 86.
62) 38) dialog: only yourself. Socked in the stomach and winded --
62) 40) dialog: sad?
62) 42) dialog: Nothing. Wendy stares at Larry, her face tight. A far off RUMBLE can be heard getting louder and louder. It is the sound of Wendy's resentment growing.

86) 4) dialog: ‘These are for you.
86) 6) dialog: They don’t have a scent. They're from the deli. I never understand why that is with flowers from there. I guess you have to go to a real florist and pay extra if you want the nice smell. Wendy smiles and stands there. It’s awkward.
86) 7) dialog: can I come in a minute? Wendy opens the door and Larry enters.
86) 9) dialog: I wasn’t going to tell you about it. 1 mean, it must seem ridiculous compared to what you’ve been going through. You had a human being die on you —-
