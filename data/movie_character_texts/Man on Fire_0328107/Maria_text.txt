Gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is goin after any remnants with a   crust of bread. Creasy hasn't touched his. MARIA, the cook, enters.    As she clocks Creasy's plate.

54) 2) dialog: My pleasure, Creasy. Pinta enters  in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a bit forlorn  as she sits at opposite ends of the table from Creasy.   As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts to laugh at  what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and no place to  go. Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room. Maria and Creasy exchange a look...

63) 10) text: Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand? Maria and Gomez burst out laughing. So funny that Creasy smiles. Pinta lights up at the sight. A huge victory.
