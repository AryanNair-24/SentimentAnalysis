As he raises his hands to his face, the pistol he holds discharges into the ceiling. Guardian One watches as Creasy clubs him again in the head. Frightened footsteps running on the other side of a plywood wall. A female voice yelling from the other room. Creasy gauges their whereabouts. BOOM!    Creasy fires into the wall.    Wall explodes. Guardian Three freezes mid stride.      It's a tough look woman in her 40's.

Creasy exits holding both the 12-year-old's hand and the Female Guardian who's bound and blindfolded in her underwear. They walk straight at camera as flames shoot out of the roof. Creasy has set the place on fire. Creasy is on fire. And as they continue to walk towards us...
