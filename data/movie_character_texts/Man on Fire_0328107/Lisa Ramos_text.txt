21) 12) dialog: You've done much of this work before?
21) 15) dialog: Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy? Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat.
21) 20) dialog: Pinta! A few moments and Pinta arrives.       'Cool Hand Pinta'.

35) 4) dialog: Is the food alright?    Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
35) 6) dialog: (smiles)
35) 7) text: It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment? He shakes his head. Lisa glides into the room like a dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.
35) 8) dialog: How are you getting along with Pinta?
35) 10) dialog: (smiles)
35) 13) dialog: You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
35) 16) dialog: No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that. Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's proximity.
35) 17) dialog: I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know that's silly to say. Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.

47) 4) dialog: She has swimming practice today.    You'll need to pick her up at the pool. Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window.
47) 5) dialog: I talked to her. She understands.     She won't bother you anymore. As Creasy just drives.
48) 0) text: Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN.

66) 0) text: Mexico City traffic is heavy. Cars and people. Creasy stands by the car across the street. Cooling his heels. He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop. Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself. The street goes ominously quiet. Creasy's antennae go up. A police car comes prowling down the empty street.

The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. The body guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's shot. A PEDESTRIAN is killed. Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters. The businessman is hustled into the back of the second car. Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands.
