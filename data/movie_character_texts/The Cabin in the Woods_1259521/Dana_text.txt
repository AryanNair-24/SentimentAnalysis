1) 29) text: INT. DANA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS DANA POLK, a thoughtful, attractive college sophomore. Her room is like her: restrained and well ordered, but with funky touches of color and whimay. A few sketches and watercolors of her own dot the walls as well. Dana is in shirt and undies, packing for a trip and bopping softly to the music, which now comes from her little stereo. She does that singing-along thing where you start to sing too soon, looks sheepish even though she’s alone. She takes a couple of political science textbooks, drops them in her suitcase, Crosses to grab some art supplies, including a battered sketchbook. She pauses, flipping through her sketches —— which aren’t bad —— til she gets to a portrait of a handsome thirtysomething man with longish hair and glasses. CLOSE ON Dana staring sadly at the picture when Julie “JULES” Louden comes into frame next to her. Jules is bubbly, sexy and as of ten minutes ago, blonde.

1) 82) dialog: Hey.
2) 0) text: Holden is dumping Jules’s last suitcase (she has overpacked) into the RAMBLER, the trailer Curt owns, with the dirt-bike attached to the rear. Dana’s inside, takes it from him (polite smile between them) as he turns back to Jules and a bag-laden Curt.
2) 5) dialog: (looking eff) Oh my gad... ANGLE: A CAR has just finished parking. Martin “MARTY” Mikalski is getting out of the driver's seat while smoking a huge bong. It’s difficult to maneuver, but definitely not his first time. His friends instantly look around for, oh, say, police...
5) 0) text: It trucks along an old road, nothing but brush visible. INT. RAMBLER — CONTINUOUS The gang is in mid-ride, clearly a couple hours in. curt is still driving. Jules, riding shotgun, is checking both a map and the GPs. Marty sits at the little table, cautiously relling an elegant, filtered row of joints. Dana sits with him, Holden in the bathroom with the doo open, where we can see they’ve stashed a keg. He's filling three cups.

8) 0) text: There’s no audio but music as the kids all crowd the front of the van to look at their vacation spot. The lake appears up ahead, sun rippling over the water, and they look and point, talking a bit. Finally the camera races through the forest and finds the cabin. It squats uninvitingly, a fairly ramshackle -- though not overly rustic —- single story structure. Windows on either side of the door, not unlike closed eyes. The van pulls up and the kids come out, more slowly than they did at the gas station, taking it in. Dana's a little entranced, Holden curious, Curt pumped, Jules mildly excited, Marty wary.
9) 0) text: She enters the living room. It’s also, if you turn to the right, the kitchen; the stove is a classic old wood— burning Kalamazoo Wonder, the sink clearly retro-fitted. The decor is sparse and antlery. A wolf’s head is mounted on one wall. A hall goes own the middle, with two bedrooms on either side. Dana makes her way around the room as the rest of the gang pours in.
9) 12) dialog: Marty? Are you Planning on coming in? He looks around, not ready to make his move. INT. HOLDEN’S ROOM — AFTERNOON Holden throws his bag on his bed, which squeaks appallingly. He looks around the decrepit -- but not entirely un-homey -- room, focusses on a picture opposite the bed. ANGLE: THE PICTURE is like 19th century print, but it’s of a hunting Party with machetes and dogs tearing a lamb to pieces and, upon close examination, is repulsive,
9) 20) dialog: That’s just creepy.

9) 38) dialog: Well, Jules is the doctor-in-training. You should probably talk to her.
9) 40) dialog: Uhhh... ah! God! Sheepishly, she grabs the picture and replaces it. Takes a@ moment to look at the slaughtered lamb scene. oe DANA (CONT’D) Yeah, I don’t think go.

15) 14) dialog: Some of this stuff looks really old. Jules studies the dressmaker’s mannequin. AN AMULET hangs around its neck. Jules touches it...
15) 21) dialog: Guys. Holden stops winding the crank. The world goes quiet. Everyone looks up from what they're doing. DANA (CONT‘D) Guys, listen to this... Reluctantly, each person puts down the object of his or her attention and moves towards Dana. DANA (CONT’D) (reads from di. “Today we felled the old birch tree out back.

Pops a couple of buttons to show more cleavage. Everyone else is sitting, Dana and Holden on the couch, Dana still holding the book, and Marty slumped in armchair, smoking sullenly. Jules dances over in front of Holden and does a little impromptu lap-dance wriggle for him. He looks a little awkward, glancing at Dana, who isn’t exactly thrilled.

Holding something round down by his side. He tosses it rigbt at Dana -- she gasps, catches it, looks down to see -- It’s Jules’ HEAD. Dana screams her heart out. She drops Jules’ head on the ground, glances up as Matthew steps up the porch. She screams and screams as Matthew approaches -- Holden dives forward, slams the door shut just as --~ WHAM! Matthew slams into it. The frame shakes, the wood splinters. Marty races forward, helps Holden brace the door.

41) 4) dialog: Mine too! He looks at her sitch -- worse than his own -- and beckons her to come through.
41) 6) dialog: The bed! They up-end it and shove it at the window, holding its metal frame against the pounding from without. Dana looks around for something else, sees: ANGLE: UNDER THE BEDSPACE is a trapdoor.
41) 7) dialog: Holden. He looks, puts his shoulder to the bed to take the weight as he indicates for her to check it out. She moves to it and pulls it open -- nothing but blackness below. She looks back at Holden.
41) 8) dialog: Better or worse? He sticks his foot out and slides a lamp to her. It’s been set on the floor (during the furniture pile-up) but still plugged in. She lowers it into the dark space, lets it hang by its plug.

It’s small -- a basic ventilation hatch, no more than a foot-and-a-half Square -- but now’s not the time to be picky. There’s a little bubble of air trapped in there, and Dana shoves her face in it, gasps it greedily. It disappears as she does and she pulls her head back, holding her breath again -- CLOSE ON: FATHER, smiling in the dark water. He doesn’t need to hold his breath.
