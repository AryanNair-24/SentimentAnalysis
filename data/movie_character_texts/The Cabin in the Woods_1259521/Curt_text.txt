The lake appears up ahead, sun rippling over the water, and they look and point, talking a bit. Finally the camera races through the forest and finds the cabin. It squats uninvitingly, a fairly ramshackle -- though not overly rustic —- single story structure. Windows on either side of the door, not unlike closed eyes.

Pops a couple of buttons to show more cleavage. Everyone else is sitting, Dana and Holden on the couch, Dana still holding the book, and Marty slumped in armchair, smoking sullenly. Jules dances over in front of Holden and does a little impromptu lap-dance wriggle for him. He looks a little awkward, glancing at Dana, who isn’t exactly thrilled.

Hadley and Sitterson stare, (looking perhaps directly into camera to make us even less comfortable)... Jules swings on top and pulls her shirt off at last. She takes her time, sliding her hands up her belly to her breasts, finally to the clasp in the middle of her bra... She pops it open, holding it together coyly for one moment before pulling the bra off, revealing her breasts, a sheen of sweat (and the fact that they’re not fake) making them all the more enticing. She smiles knowingly, a vision of hedonistic perfection. Curt looks up at her in silent wonder. All three men in the control room -- including Truman -- look at her the exact same way.

Curt howls, trying to pull it out as Jules holds her bleeding neck, trying to rise but weak. Curt pulls his arm away, bringing Judah towards him and then punches Judah hard right in the nose. The nose breaks easily, crumbling a bit, Judah completely unfazed by it. Curt looks over towards the third zombie. Matthew stands a few feet away, leaning slightly. Suddenly he lets a chain slide through his fingers, all the way to the ground, pulled by a broken bear-trap, just a rusty metal jaw with teeth: a turn-of-the-century mace and chain. Matthew grins. The trap swings with sudden speed, whacking Curt’s head (luckily not with the jagged side) and knocking him back, bleeding and dazed.
