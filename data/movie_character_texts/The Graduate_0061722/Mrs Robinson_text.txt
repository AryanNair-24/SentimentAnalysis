As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, mutterin to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side.  As they get through, Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and the pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the CLERK behind the desk. The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some- where.  The group of young people passes by the desk and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes agai the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively.
