47) 9) dialog: All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
47) 11) dialog: I'm not.  No.  But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
47) 13) dialog: Anything.  Anything at all.
47) 15) dialog: Oh my God. MRS. ROBINSON
47) 17) dialog: Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best we can do let's just get the god- damn clothes off and -- She reaches for her shoe.

47) 22) dialog: Oh.
47) 24) dialog: Yes I do.  I know quite a bit about it.
47) 26) dialog: Art.  Well what do you want to know about it. She shrugs.
47) 27) dialog: Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
47) 29) dialog: You're not interested in art?
47) 31) dialog: Then why do you want to talk about it?

47) 48) dialog: Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.

47) 52) dialog: There's no risk? She shakes her head.
47) 53) dialog: How do you get out of the house?

47) 64) dialog: (smiling)
47) 67) dialog: We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
47) 69) dialog: Now let's keep going here.
47) 71) dialog: Right.
47) 73) dialog: Now.  You say the driveway's on your side of the house.  So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
47) 75) dialog: So you don't - I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
47) 77) dialog: Well how long has this been going on.
47) 80) dialog: Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

47) 97) dialog: Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
47) 99) dialog: I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse.  If you hated him at least you'd hate him. She nods and takes off her blouse.
47) 100) dialog: Well you loved him once, I assume.  When you first knew him.
47) 102) dialog: What?
47) 104) dialog: Well, wait a minute.  You married him. She nods.
47) 105) dialog: Why did you do that?
47) 108) dialog: Well I can't.
47) 110) dialog: I can't see why you did, unless ...you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
47) 112) dialog: Oh no.  You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
47) 114) dialog: Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
47) 116) dialog: Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
47) 118) dialog: I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
47) 120) dialog: Was he a law student at the time? She nods.
47) 121) dialog: And you were a student also.
47) 123) dialog: At college.
47) 125) dialog: What was your major?
47) 127) dialog: Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
47) 129) dialog: Art? She nods.
47) 130) dialog: But I thought you - I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
47) 132) dialog: Well how did it happen?
47) 134) dialog: I mean did he take you up to his room with him?  Did you go to a hotel?
47) 136) dialog: I'm curious.
47) 138) dialog: Oh no.  In the car you did it?
47) 140) dialog: What kind of car was it?
47) 142) dialog: Do you remember the make of the car?

47) 151) dialog: Don't talk about Elaine?
47) 153) dialog: Why not?
47) 155) dialog: Well why don't you? She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his jacket.
47) 156) dialog: I wish you'd tell me.
47) 158) dialog: Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden? Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.
47) 159) dialog: Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
47) 162) dialog: Well look.  I have no intention of taking her out.
47) 164) dialog: I was just kidding around.
47) 166) dialog: But why shouldn't I?
47) 168) dialog: Then let's hear them.
47) 170) dialog: Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson.  Because I think I know what they are. She pulls the covers down.
47) 171) dialog: I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I?  I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
47) 173) dialog: We're not dropping it.  Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I?  I'm not fit to -
47) 175) dialog: I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter.  That's it, isn't it?  ISN'T IT?
47) 177) dialog: You go to hell.  You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you think I'm proud of myself?  Do you think I'm proud of this?
47) 179) dialog: Well, I'm not.
47) 181) dialog: No sir.  I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic!
47) 183) dialog: And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong. She nods.
47) 184) dialog: Because - Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me.  And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
47) 186) dialog: You're goddamn right I am. He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of the bed and watches him.
47) 189) dialog: Now don't start this.
47) 191) dialog: Don't start acting hurt.
47) 193) dialog: Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
47) 195) dialog: Of course you did. She shakes her head.
47) 197) dialog: Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter.  Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
47) 199) dialog: You wouldn't.
47) 201) dialog: What are you doing?
47) 203) dialog: Well look - I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
47) 205) dialog: But it's not.
47) 208) dialog: Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
47) 210) dialog: It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look forward to it.  It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
47) 212) dialog: Well I wouldn't.  I would never say it if it wasn't true.
47) 214) dialog: Yes. Please.  I want you to.
47) 216) dialog: Well don't thank me, because I want you to. There is a long pause.
47) 218) dialog: Look.  Why the hell did you bring this up.  It never occured to me to take her out.
