21) 0) text: The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR. and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch- ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the Arnolds and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too old for them. Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the othe end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

45) 13) text: Now listen, Ben.  I think it's a very good thing that a young man - after he's done some very good work - should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on.  But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass. Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

46) 3) dialog: Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.

46) 21) dialog: Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.

His face is in the water, looking down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep their heads above the surface.
50) 1) dialog: It's pretty embarrassing.  I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
