15) 0) text: December 24th.  Wendell "BUD" WHITE, 30, stares at the enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over Bullocks' entrance.  An LAPD cop, Bud's rep as the toughest man on the force has been well earned.  In the back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is Bud's partner -- DICK STENSLAND.  Older, but also a tough hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow. The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard Johnny Stompanato slides in.  Guinea handsome, Johnny wears his curls in a tight pompadour.  With his boss behind bars, he's out of work.  Bud just stares at him.

Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer, then puts Garcia down with a left-right. Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.

Well-wishing cops pat him on the back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks like he's going to cry. It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face with them.  This is hatred. Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling. Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot sails wide as Exley falls to the ground. As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him.
