24) 0) text: Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the walls as the OWNER takes an order from LYNN BRACKEN.
24) 1) dialog: A case each of gin, Scotch, and rum.  Everything top shelf.  None of that watered-down stuff you push on Errol Flynn.
24) 3) text: Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a moment.
24) 5) dialog: Before five tomorrow.
24) 8) text: The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at each other.  Bud says the only thing he can think of.
24) 10) dialog: Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.
24) 12) dialog: (smiles sweetly) It's practically stamped on your forehead.
25) 7) dialog: (exiting store) We just call him Buzz.
25) 15) dialog: It's not what you think.
25) 16) text: Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's door.
25) 20) dialog: (getting in the car) But it's nice to know you care.
67) 0) text: The film is This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake.  It's projected on a wall in front of which stands Lynn Bracken and an OLDER GENTLEMAN, in his underwear. Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye.  She looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake.  The film flashes over them as they kiss. The PHONE RINGS.  Lynn ignores it as long as she can before breaking away to go answer it.
67) 1) dialog: Hello?
67) 3) text: She waves him off.  As he practices pointing his finger like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the phone.
69) 0) text: Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled Older Gentleman out the door.
69) 2) dialog: I'm sorry, but I'll make it up to you.  I promise.
69) 9) text: Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth.
69) 10) dialog: I've been expecting you.  Pierce called.  Told me what happened to Sue.
70) 1) dialog: It's Officer White, isn't it?
70) 3) dialog: Can I get you a drink?
70) 6) dialog: I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
70) 8) dialog: Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
70) 11) dialog: No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
70) 13) dialog: Yes.  But do you know?
70) 15) dialog: That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
70) 17) dialog: I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
70) 19) dialog: Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
70) 21) dialog: Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
70) 23) dialog: He's waiting for you to mention mention.
70) 25) dialog: It's Lynn.
70) 27) text: Lynn smiles again.  She likes Bud.  A beat.
70) 28) dialog: I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
70) 30) dialog: You say 'fuck' a lot.
70) 32) dialog: There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
70) 34) dialog: Do you enjoy it?
70) 36) dialog: Did they deserve it today?
70) 38) dialog: But you did it anyway.
70) 40) dialog: (laughs again) Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
70) 42) dialog: He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
70) 44) dialog: No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
70) 45) text: Lynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment, then follows.  She takes his glass at the door.
70) 46) dialog: It was nice meeting you, Officer.
70) 49) dialog: Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
70) 51) dialog: (another smile) If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
70) 53) text: Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away. He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off. A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...
85) 0) text: Sitting behind a desk is the Older Gentleman last seen doing his best Alan Ladd impersonation at Lynn Bracken's. He stares emphatically at the SMARMY LAWYER who stands before him holding a manila folder.
85) 2) text: The Lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs.  From Lynn Bracken's apartment.  The first is the Older Gentleman naked except for his socks and garters.
87) 0) text: Rain.  A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps, knocks on the door.  Lynn answers in an evening gown.  He gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her. Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan a look down the street. Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened silhouette behind the wheel.  Smiling a bit sadly to herself, Lynn disappears inside. This is no stake-out.  Bud watches after her with yearning.
92) 0) text: The monied johns watch horny as hell as "Ginger Rogers" twirls around the room with a female "Fred Astaire." Clothes fly as they spin.  Still, most eyes turn to Lynn Bracken as she enters oozing that cat-girl grace.
98) 0) text: Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment,  Colored lights play on the windows.  Shadows pass.  Finally the front door opens.  There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman goodnight.  Bud watches the man into a waiting limo.  As it pulls away...
100) 1) dialog: (opening door) Did you forget some --
100) 3) dialog: I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
100) 5) text: Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet. Embarrassed.  She smiles.
100) 6) dialog: You should see yourself.  You look like you're ten years old.
100) 7) text: Bud looks back up.  Lynn's smile fades as she studies his face.  She's not going to ask questions.  Lynn looks at him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde hair covering one eye.
100) 8) dialog: If you'd called first, I wouldn't look this ridiculous.
101) 0) text: Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back.  Bud goes slow, gently, takes time with his kisses:  like she was a lonely woman he wanted to love to death. Lynn plays off his timing:  her kisses back, her touches. Finally, Bud forces himself to stop.  He pulls back so he can see her.
101) 1) dialog: You're wondering if Patchett told me to be receptive.
101) 3) dialog: It doesn't matter.  I like you, Bud.  I really do.
106) 0) text: Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.
106) 2) text: Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small white scar.
106) 3) dialog: It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... (re: scar) Where'd this come from?
106) 5) dialog: So you saved her.
106) 7) text: Bud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about it.
106) 8) dialog: Do you like being a cop, Bud?
106) 10) text: Lynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up.
106) 14) text: Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.
106) 15) dialog: You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
106) 17) text: Lynn nods.  That simple.
123) 3) text: They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin. The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye. They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before...
130) 0) text: KNOCKING on the door.  Lynn answers to reveal Exley.
130) 2) dialog: I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
130) 4) dialog: He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
130) 7) dialog: He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
130) 8) text: Exley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back.
130) 11) dialog: I'm curious about you.
130) 14) dialog: Because Bud hates you more than he loves me.
130) 15) text: Exley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass.
130) 16) dialog: It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
130) 18) dialog: The way you've underestimated Bud White?
130) 19) text: Exley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes. As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror.
134) 0) text: Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor. They're quiet.  Then, through a smile:
134) 2) dialog: Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
134) 4) dialog: The silver screen's loss is your gain.
134) 6) dialog: You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
134) 9) dialog: I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
134) 11) dialog: I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
134) 13) dialog: Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
134) 15) dialog: You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
134) 17) dialog: I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
134) 19) dialog: No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
134) 21) dialog: Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
134) 22) text: Exley doesn't answer, but the answer is yes.  Lynn smiles.
134) 23) dialog: You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
134) 25) dialog: Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
134) 27) dialog: Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
142) 0) text: Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with a ferocious yank.  He tears at the carpeting.  A manila envelope.  Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley and Lynn spill out.  Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his Packard and tearing out of there.
145) 0) text: Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down. A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up. She watches as he gets out and starts for the house. Lynn stands, holds her arms out.  Bud stops short on the steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.
145) 2) dialog: Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
145) 5) dialog: He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
145) 7) text: More lightning.  Lynn looks God-awful sad.
145) 8) dialog: Come in out of the rain, Bud.
145) 10) dialog: We talked.
145) 12) dialog: (looking away) In the morning.
145) 14) text: Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods.
145) 15) dialog: I thought I was helping you.  I thought --
145) 16) text: Bud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically. She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back into the rain.
152) 0) text: Lynn looks up as Exley enters.  her face is puffy, swollen.
152) 1) dialog: (dry) If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
152) 5) dialog: (shakes her head) I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
152) 7) dialog: (a beat) I know how he feels.
152) 10) text: Lynn looks away, can't help an ironic smile even as she starts to cry.  As Exley gives her his handkerchief...
169) 2) text: Applause.  Flashbulbs.  Lynn watches from the back as Exley runs a handshake gauntlet.  Finally, he spots her. She's returned to her natural brunette.  Looks even better.  Exley steps over.
170) 0) text: Exley walks Lynn out.
170) 2) dialog: Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
170) 4) dialog: Right now, before I back down.
170) 6) text: Lynn gestures ahead.  They walk to her car.  She opens the back door.  Bud's in the back.  Braces on his legs, head sutured.  Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and out.  But his hands still look strong.  Bud forces a smile through the wires, tries to say something, but can't.
170) 13) dialog: We should go now.
170) 14) text: As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door.  PARTY noises drift from upstairs.  Exley looks to Lynn.
170) 16) dialog: Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
