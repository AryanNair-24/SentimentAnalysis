15) 0) text: December 24th.  Wendell "BUD" WHITE, 30, stares at the enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over Bullocks' entrance.  An LAPD cop, Bud's rep as the toughest man on the force has been well earned.  In the back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is Bud's partner -- DICK STENSLAND.  Older, but also a tough hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow. The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard Johnny Stompanato slides in.  Guinea handsome, Johnny wears his curls in a tight pompadour.  With his boss behind bars, he's out of work.  Bud just stares at him.
15) 2) dialog: And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. Capisce, shitbird?
15) 3) text: Stompanato smiles.  Nervous.  Through the window, Bud watches a Salvation Army Santa palm coins from a kettle.
15) 6) text: Impatient, Bud tugs at a finger, CRACKS a KNUCKLE.
15) 8) text: Bud's eyes narrow at this last bit of info.  Stompanato holds up a slip of paper.
15) 10) text: Bud digs into his wallet, pulls out twenty bucks, exchanges it with Stompanato.  Stompanato smiles smugly, grabs a bottle of Scotch from the back.
15) 12) text: Without warning, Bud grabs Stompanato's tie and yanks, slamming his forehead into the dash.
15) 13) dialog: Happy New Year, greaseball.
16) 2) text: Bud KILLS the IGNITION, picks up the radio.
16) 3) dialog: Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White male in custody.  Code 623 point one.  Domestic assault and battery.  I won't be here, but they'll see him.
17) 0) text: steps to the house.  Inside, we hear SLAPS, MUFFLED CRIES.  Bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and yanks.  The sleigh crashes to the ground with REINDEER EXPLODING around it.  A beat.  The fat guy runs out to investigate, trips over Rudolph. Bud pounces.  Fat guy takes a swing, misses.  Grabbing fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement. Once, twice.  Teeth skitter down the walk.
17) 1) dialog: Touch her again and I'll know about it.  Understand?  Huh?
17) 2) text: Another face full of gravel.  Fat guy's WIFE watches with apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's hands behind his back, empties his pockets.  A cash roll and car keys.  Bud looks over at her.
17) 3) dialog: You got someplace you can go?
17) 4) text: She nods.  Bud hands her the keys and the cash.
17) 5) dialog: Go get yourself fixed up.
17) 7) text: Bud watches as she gets into a pre-war Ford in the drive. She backs over a blinking reindeer as she goes.
24) 3) text: Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a moment.
24) 6) text: The Owner spots Bud.  A big smile turns to a frown.
24) 8) text: The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at each other.  Bud says the only thing he can think of.
24) 9) dialog: Merry Christmas.
24) 11) dialog: That obvious, huh?
25) 0) text: Bud exits with his booze, heads for the car.  Something catches his eye.  A woman in the rear passenger seat of a new Cadillac.  SUSAN LEFFERTS.  Both her eyes are black. Bud starts over.  The case on his hip, he motions for her to roll down the window.  The driver's side door opens and bodyguard TURNER "BUZZ" MEEKS menaces his way out.
25) 2) text: Meeks stops short as Bud shoves his badge in Meeks' face. Setting the case on the car's hood, Bud spins Meeks around, pats him down.  He finds a .38 in a shoulder holster.
25) 4) text: Bud removes Meeks' wallet, checks the ID.
25) 6) dialog: Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.
25) 8) text: Bud raps on Susan's window with his badge.  It comes down.
25) 9) dialog: You okay?
25) 12) dialog: (menacing) I'm not asking you.
25) 13) text: Patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice.  As he stares impatiently at Bud, Bud looks back to Susan.
25) 14) dialog: Somebody hit you?
25) 16) text: Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's door.
25) 17) dialog: What is it then?
25) 21) text: Bud considers Meeks' gun license, then hands him back the .38 and wallet.  Lifting his booze, Bud watches Meeks get back in the car. Stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away.
25) 24) dialog: You know him?
29) 0) text: A large impromptu bar has been set-up.  The party is in full swing, the floor packed with nightwatch blues.  A PHONOGRAPH SPEWS DIRTY CHRISTMAS CAROLS. Stensland pours eggnog and Old Crow into the water cooler as Bud elbows his way in with another case.
29) 2) dialog: I got to write my report first.
29) 5) text: More cops vocie their agreement.  Bottles are passed. Only Bud doesn't seem as caught-up as the rest.
33) 0) text: Bud types his report with one finger.  Jack looks in.
34) 0) text: Followed by Jack, Bud forces his way through the crowd. The men who see it's him quickly clear a path. Swigging from a pint of gin, Stensland works skinny GARCIA.  Head saps.  The kid drops to his knees drooling blood. Bud grabs Stensland, hauls him off of Garcia who looks up.
34) 2) dialog: Yeah yeah...
34) 4) text: Bud sees red.  Letting go of Stensland, Bud White picks up Garcia by the neck.  There are cheers, "Attaboys" and "Holy Fucks" as Bud bangs Garcia's head on the ceiling.
34) 6) text: Cops block Exley's way.  As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks him in the balls.  A dangling shot.  Bud keels into the bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack. Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer, then puts Garcia down with a left-right. Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.
34) 8) text: Exley has just started taking names when Bud grabs him by the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into...
35) 0) text: The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform. Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands across from them.  There to be judged.
35) 2) text: Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief.
35) 3) dialog: No, sir.  I won't.
35) 6) text: Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo.  The headline:  "BLOODY CHRISTMAS."
35) 8) dialog: I won't do it. (staring at mirror) I won't testify against my partner or anyone else.
35) 11) text: Bud sets them on The Chief's desk.
37) 0) text: An old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano. Bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a REDHEAD with too much make-up on too many miles.
37) 1) dialog: That an old fashioned you're drinking? (as she nods) My name's Bud.
37) 3) dialog: They stick you with a name like Wendell, you look for an alias.
37) 5) dialog: I'm sorta between jobs.  Look, what do you say we, uh...
37) 6) text: A hand on Bud's shoulder.  He turns to see Dudley Smith.
37) 8) dialog: This business, Captain?
37) 10) text: Dudley starts off.  Bud turns back to Redhead, but she's already talking to a sailor.
37) 12) dialog: Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
37) 14) dialog: Captain, what do you want?
37) 16) dialog: Dudley, what do you want?
37) 18) dialog: (looks away) Yeah, I hate them.
37) 20) text: Bud looks back over.  Dudley's getting too personal.
37) 21) dialog: What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  He's one year from his pension.
37) 23) dialog: He helped me out once.  That's all.
37) 25) dialog: Him and me both.  Fucking Exley.
37) 27) dialog: What do you want?
37) 29) dialog: Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
37) 30) text: Smith yanks the newspaper revealing Bud's badge &amp; .38 Special.  Bud can't believe his eyes.
37) 32) dialog: I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
37) 34) dialog: How?
37) 37) dialog: (excited) Homicide?  A detective?
37) 39) dialog: (disappointed) In Technicolor.
37) 41) dialog: Of course... But how?
37) 43) dialog: How'd you get them to retract?
43) 0) text: Bud White flips through today's booking slips, finds one that's interesting.  Reading to himself...
43) 1) dialog: Domestic.  Assault and battery.
43) 4) dialog: I'll be there in five minutes.
43) 6) dialog: I hear you like to hit women.
43) 8) text: Bud enters, closes the door behind him.  A beat, we hear the sounds of FISTS ON FLESH.  It's Bud's business now.
49) 0) text: Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of his desk into a box.  Well-wishing cops pat him on the back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks like he's going to cry. It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face with them.  This is hatred. Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling. Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot sails wide as Exley falls to the ground. As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him.
49) 5) text: Four cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back. Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration.
50) 0) text: Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his box of stuff into the trunk.  Bud is moody, pensive.
50) 2) dialog: Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
50) 4) dialog: What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
50) 6) dialog: What are you talking about?
50) 8) text: Stensland gets in the car, drives off.  Bud is left alone.
57) 0) text: Bare.  A table and chair bolted to the floor.  A tough FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat.  On the table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills. Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a couple of short, stiff body shots.  Flatnose is not used to being on the receiving end.  All the same, we get the idea Bud's a bit reluctant. Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.
57) 2) text: Bud turns, sees Exley and Dudley.  A beat.  As Bud looms over Flatnose, the gangster babbles.  Snitch-frenzied.
58) 1) dialog: Where are we going?
59) 0) text: Exley pulls up.  Bud looks to him.  Really curious now.
60) 0) text: Exley and Bud walk.  An orderly wheels a covered corpse toward them from the other end of the hall.  Bud's spooked.  The orderly wheels the body in to the examination room. As Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet, is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite see.
60) 6) text: Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner.
60) 7) dialog: Yeah, that's Stens.
60) 9) text: Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out why Stensland is dead.  He squeezes out the words.
60) 10) dialog: What happened?
61) 0) text: HILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the body of her daughter, Susan. There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders, but a sheet hides the real damage.  It's the girl Bud saw outside Hollywood Liquor.  Without the black eyes, she does look like Rita hayworth. As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused.
61) 4) text: Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased.
61) 10) text: As Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up.
62) 2) text: Bud White listens, not too sure.  Stensland said he had something big going on...
63) 0) text: Detectives pairing up and moving out.  Scanning his three name list, Bud joins his PARTNER for the day.
63) 1) dialog: Can you take them?  I got I got something I gotta do.
63) 3) dialog: What I gotta do is for Stensland. My partner.
63) 4) text: The guy looks at him a beat, nods.  As Bud heads off...
64) 0) text: Last time we saw the Owner was Christmas Eve.  He looks up from a customer as Bud strides in, badge out front.
64) 1) dialog: I need an address on a customer of yours.  Her name was Lynn.
64) 3) dialog: Yeah.  And I think you already know who I mean, so cough it up.
64) 5) dialog: Give me both.  Billing first.
65) 1) dialog: You must slay 'em at the country club.
65) 2) text: Bud's halfway up the walk.  Patchett sees the cuffs hooked to his belt.  Patchett is cool as can be.
65) 3) dialog: Are you Pierce Patchett?
65) 5) dialog: I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
65) 7) dialog: Richard Stensland.
65) 9) dialog: Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
65) 11) dialog: We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
65) 13) dialog: Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
65) 14) text: Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options. Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house.
65) 17) dialog: Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
65) 20) dialog: Thanks, but no thanks.
65) 22) dialog: I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
65) 24) dialog: No.
65) 26) dialog: That's right.
65) 28) dialog: (ignores comment) Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
65) 30) dialog: You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
65) 32) text: Bud nods, his patience running thin.
65) 34) dialog: What little studio?
65) 36) dialog: That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
65) 38) dialog: I got her address.
65) 40) text: Bud turns, heads down the walk.  Patchett hits his golf ball.  It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest. Ice.
69) 5) dialog: Hit the road, gramps.
69) 6) text: Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs.  The Older Gentleman strikes a pose.  He still thinks he's Alan Ladd.
69) 8) dialog: (flips badge) L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck out of here or I'll call your wife to come get you.
69) 9) text: Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth.
70) 2) text: Bud nods, eyeballs the place.
70) 4) dialog: Yeah, plain scotch.
70) 5) text: Bud watches her move to the bar.  God, she's beautiful.
70) 7) dialog: Are you sorry she's dead?
70) 10) dialog: Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
70) 12) dialog: You use words like that, you might make me mad.
70) 14) dialog: Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
70) 16) dialog: Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
70) 18) dialog: Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
70) 20) dialog: How'd she meet Patchett?
70) 22) dialog: Tell me about Patchett.
70) 24) dialog: You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
70) 26) dialog: Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
70) 27) text: Lynn smiles again.  She likes Bud.  A beat.
70) 29) dialog: Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
70) 31) dialog: You fuck for money.
70) 33) dialog: Yeah.
70) 35) dialog: When they deserve it.
70) 37) dialog: I'm not sure.
70) 39) dialog: Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
70) 41) dialog: You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett.
70) 43) dialog: He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
70) 45) text: Lynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment, then follows.  She takes his glass at the door.
70) 47) text: Out the door, Bud turns back.  Blurts:
70) 48) dialog: Look.  I want to see you again.
70) 50) dialog: (suddenly unsure) I don't know.
70) 52) dialog: (feeling foolish) Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
70) 53) text: Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away. He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off. A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...
73) 0) text: Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report, memorizing names and dates.  Jack and other brass are also here along with a stenographer.  So's Bud.  One of these guys killed Stensland.  Through tinted glass, the three suspects in three different rooms.
73) 76) text: Bud's all ears.
73) 90) text: They don't notice as the chair back begins to splinter in Bud's hands.
73) 93) text: The door blasts open.  Bud slams Jones up against the wall.  As Exley stands, he bangs his knee on the table. Pulling a .38, Bud breaks the cylinder, drops 5 shells on the floor.
73) 94) dialog: One in six.  Where's the girl?
73) 96) text: Bud shoves the barrel into Jones' mouth, pulls the trigger twice.  CLICK, CLICK.  Jones starts to slide down the wall.  Bud jerks him back up, roars.
73) 97) dialog: WHERE?!
74) 0) text: A four cordon.  They coast up to a GRAY CORNER HOUSE. Dudley Smith behind the wheel of the lead cruiser.  Bud White rides shotgun, reloading his revolver.
74) 1) dialog: Give me one minute.
75) 0) text: The Girl on a stretcher.  Being carried to an AMBULANCE. Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious pet pit bull.  The ATTENDANTS get her inside.  One joins her.  The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke. Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking the guy's lips with it.
75) 1) dialog: Get her to the fucking hospital.
75) 2) text: One look at Bud, and the Attendant is running around to the driver's side.  Exley arrives, steamed.
75) 4) dialog: Get the fuck away from me.
75) 5) text: Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face.  Other cops begin to take notice.  The ambulance pulls out.
75) 7) dialog: It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  Justice.
75) 9) text: Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart. Dudley on Exley.  Four cops genuinely having trouble on Bud. And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the cops on the street.  POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP.
81) 2) text: A sea of dress blues.  Jack looks bored, dressed too flashy for a funeral.  Bud looks grim, rain dripping off the brim of his cap.  As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is FIRED...
87) 0) text: Rain.  A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps, knocks on the door.  Lynn answers in an evening gown.  He gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her. Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan a look down the street. Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened silhouette behind the wheel.  Smiling a bit sadly to herself, Lynn disappears inside. This is no stake-out.  Bud watches after her with yearning.
93) 10) text: Exley considers his medal.  It is an appealing thing. In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows pretend smoke off the barrel.  As the song ends...
95) 0) text: Screams.  A cauliflower-eared Cleveland mob enforcer on the hotseat. Breuning works him with a rubber hose as Dudley asks unanswered questions.  Bud watches, revulsion growing.
95) 2) text: More screams as the hose thwops down.  Bud looks away, then shuffles blindly out of the room.
96) 0) text: Bud runs water in the sink to drown out the SCREAMS.  It doesn't work.  Finally, he leans down and sticks his head under the stream of water.  That doesn't work either.
97) 0) text: Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car.  The tires spit gravel as he tears away.  Dudley appears in the doorway, watching curiously.  As cauliflower continues to SCREAM...
98) 0) text: Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment,  Colored lights play on the windows.  Shadows pass.  Finally the front door opens.  There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman goodnight.  Bud watches the man into a waiting limo.  As it pulls away...
100) 2) text: Bud stands there, filling up the door frame.
100) 4) dialog: It's Bud.
100) 5) text: Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet. Embarrassed.  She smiles.
100) 7) text: Bud looks back up.  Lynn's smile fades as she studies his face.  She's not going to ask questions.  Lynn looks at him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde hair covering one eye.
101) 0) text: Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back.  Bud goes slow, gently, takes time with his kisses:  like she was a lonely woman he wanted to love to death. Lynn plays off his timing:  her kisses back, her touches. Finally, Bud forces himself to stop.  He pulls back so he can see her.
101) 2) text: Bud doesn't answer, but yes.
101) 4) text: She kisses him.  Softly, drawing it out.  Not a job.  She wants to make love to him.  And as Bud stops thinking...
106) 0) text: Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.
106) 1) dialog: Who was that guy who was here earlier?
106) 2) text: Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small white scar.
106) 4) dialog: When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
106) 6) dialog: Yeah.  But not for long.
106) 7) text: Bud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about it.
106) 9) dialog: I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
106) 10) text: Lynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up.
106) 11) dialog: There's something wrong with the Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot the wrong guys.  But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there.
106) 12) text: Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest.
106) 13) dialog: In here I know it.  But I can't prove it.  I'm not a detective. I'm not smart enough.  I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.
106) 14) text: Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.
106) 16) dialog: That simple, huh?
109) 0) text: Ray Pinker looks up from his microscope as Bud enters.
109) 2) dialog: I got a few Nite Owl questions.
109) 4) dialog: I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
109) 6) dialog: Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
109) 8) text: Pinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall.  Bud pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table. We see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor.
109) 9) dialog: Whose shoe?
109) 11) dialog: (pointing) If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
109) 13) dialog: But she's moving away from the door. (thinks; points) Who was sitting at this table?
109) 15) text: Bud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place. Pinker remembers something.
109) 17) text: Pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands Bud.  Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls.
109) 19) dialog: Ear plugs.
109) 21) dialog: It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
109) 23) dialog: It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
109) 25) text: Bud just stares at the picture of Susan Lefferts.
110) 0) text: A shingle shack dump.  Bud walks the front steps, RINGS the BELL.  Hilda Lefferts answers.  She doesn't look so good.
110) 1) dialog: Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
110) 3) dialog: Five minutes.  That's all.
111) 1) dialog: Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
111) 3) dialog: Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
111) 6) dialog: What was that boyfriend's name?
111) 8) dialog: Stens?  Was it Stens?
111) 10) dialog: Look at a picture for me.
111) 11) text: Bud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana. Out of uniform.  She recognizes him.
111) 13) dialog: You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
111) 16) text: Bud starts for the closed door.
111) 17) dialog: What's through here?
111) 19) text: Bud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into...
111) 22) dialog: Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
111) 24) text: As Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door.
112) 0) text: Holding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into...
112) 2) dialog: Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.
113) 0) text: Bud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air. Mrs. Lefferts is there.  She's scared.

123) 3) text: They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin. The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye. They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before...

141) 28) text: Bud can't hear him.  He uprights the chair one-handed. As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and Dudley.  This is no act.  They can barely hold Bud back.
141) 30) text: Bud breaks free, heads outside.
142) 0) text: Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with a ferocious yank.  He tears at the carpeting.  A manila envelope.  Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley and Lynn spill out.  Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his Packard and tearing out of there.
145) 0) text: Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down. A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up. She watches as he gets out and starts for the house. Lynn stands, holds her arms out.  Bud stops short on the steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.
145) 1) dialog: Did you talk to Exley?
145) 3) text: Lightning flashes.  Bud shakes hs head.
145) 4) dialog: I want to know about Exley.

145) 11) dialog: So tell me about it.
145) 13) dialog: No.  Now. (a beat) You fucked him.
145) 16) text: Bud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically. She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back into the rain.
146) 0) text: Drawers are open.  Files are everywhere.  Exley's reached the end of the line.  As he looks through one last file, he finds a stack of official photos.  Then he stops short.  There's a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor. Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick Stensland.  The instructor is Dudley Smith! Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is there.  Fury.  He slams Exley, knocks him flat. Bud's here to kill him.  He hauls Exley up, pummels him, then throws him over the table.  Then up into a wall. Plaster cracks.  Bud's on some gonzo animal plane.  Bud strangles him.  Exley gags.  It'll be over in moments. Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38.  Yanking it from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead. Bud reels.  But, blind with rage, he moves back in only to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his eyes.
146) 2) dialog: Lynn.
146) 4) text: Bud shakes his head.  He's coiled, ready to make a move.
146) 6) text: Bud hesitates, the answer obvious.
146) 10) text: Bud sees, but does he really?  As Bud reaches for the photo, Exley relaxes slightly.  Bud slaps the gun away, drops Exley to the ground.  He grabs, begins slamming his head into the floor.
146) 12) text: Exley's almost out.  But maybe Bud heard him.  The attack slows, stops as Bud does think.  Exley stays conscious.
146) 13) dialog: I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
146) 15) dialog: Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
146) 17) dialog: Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. (a beat) The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.

146) 21) dialog: Dudley.
146) 23) dialog: Dudley's guys.
146) 25) dialog: It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
146) 29) dialog: Let's just kill them.
146) 31) dialog: For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
146) 33) dialog: There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.

146) 37) dialog: Which one are you and which one am I?

150) 20) text: The MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it. Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his head in the toilet. He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath.  Then backhands:  one, two, three.
150) 21) dialog: Dudley Smith.  Spill.
150) 24) text: More backhands.  Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck, Bud marches him past Exley and back into the...

155) 2) dialog: You wanted to meet here?
155) 4) text: As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear TIRES on the GRAVEL; CARS are COMING.  Being in a concavity, they don't see them yet.  Then the CARS STOP.   But still Bud and Exley can't see anything.  They hear the CLICKS of CAR DOORS OPENING, but they don't hear them shut.  There are FOOTSTEPS, MURMURED WHISPERS.  More CARS PULL UP.
155) 6) text: Exley starts for his car, but Bud holds him back.
155) 7) dialog: Too late.
156) 0) text: There's a big back window.  Bud covers most of it with a ratty old mattress.  He pumps the shotgun. He pulls a .45 automatic from his waistband.

156) 10) text: A CREAK outside the front door.  Bud levels the SHOTGUN. BOOM!  The DOOR is BLOWN OFF ITS HINGES.  We see the figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt.  In the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES from all around.  Exley and Bud RETURN FIRE. We hear the BACK WINDOW BREAK under a MUFFLED BLOW.  Bud charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men climbing through.  Sitting ducks:  torn apart by THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS close in.  A beat, then...
156) 12) text: Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP. A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails him. Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window.
157) 0) text: Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then... Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM 6.
158) 0) text: Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down. The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in. Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard. They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the side.  The men look at each other, sneer. Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload. Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet.
158) 2) text: At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door. He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the ground. The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes. Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat. He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest. Bud falls hard. Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen moment.
158) 12) text: Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket.
158) 14) text: It's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses... Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE.
170) 6) text: Lynn gestures ahead.  They walk to her car.  She opens the back door.  Bud's in the back.  Braces on his legs, head sutured.  Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and out.  But his hands still look strong.  Bud forces a smile through the wires, tries to say something, but can't.
170) 8) text: Exley takes his hand.  Bud squeezes till both men wince.
170) 10) text: Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand.
170) 12) text: Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears.
170) 17) text: A beat.  Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona. She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the CAR.  STARTS it. Exley looks back at Bud.  Bud presses his hands to the glass.  Exley touches his side, palms half the man's size.  Hands against hands. The car moves. A turn into traffic, a good-bye TOOT on the HORN.  Exley's all alone.  As he watches them go...
