"Trashcan" JACK VINCENNES, late 30s with slick, good looks, dances with a young ACTRESS.  Grinding their way through a ballad, they're obviously hitting it off.
18) 2) dialog: Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll give you the low-down on Mitchum.
18) 4) dialog: Two sets.
18) 8) dialog: Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine.
18) 10) text: The Actress storms off.  Jack looks to Sid.
18) 12) dialog: Is she?
18) 14) dialog: You lost me, Sid.  Who?
18) 16) dialog: I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
18) 18) dialog: No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
19) 0) text: WITH a VIEW of Grauman's Chinese.  Jack and two uniformed patrolmen wait on the darkened street.  An arc light has been set up.  Hudgeons creeps back over from the house.
19) 2) dialog: Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
20) 0) text: The arc light floods the living room about the same time that Jack kicks the door in.  The room is caught flush: Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids necking in their BVDs.  MATT REYNOLDS and TAMMY JORDAN.
20) 1) dialog: Police!
21) 0) text: Jack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck. Jack stops with Grauman's FRAMED behind him and Hudgeons CLICKS off several shots with his CAMERA.
21) 2) text: Windows light up.  Rubberneckers appear.  Jack hands the kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in tow.
22) 0) text: Jack scoops the pot, flips through an address book.  A card falls out.  "Fleur-de-Lis.  Whatever you desire..." Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being loaded into a black and white.  They're both crying now.
22) 2) dialog: Yeah, it's subtle.
30) 0) text: Jack Vincennes at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, Jack dials the number.  A corkboard on the wall is posted with press clippings.  "Dope Crusader Wounded in Shootout."  "Actor Mitchum Seized in Marijuana Shack Raid."  That one includes a shot of Jack ushering Mitchum into jail.
30) 2) dialog: Hi... I'd like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills.
30) 4) text: CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Jack redials.
30) 6) dialog: Look, a friend of mine gave me this number.  I just --
30) 7) text: The line goes dead again.  Jack dials a new number.
30) 9) dialog: This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
30) 11) dialog: I just called it.
30) 13) dialog: (realizes, hangs up) A bootleg...
32) 0) text: Stensland in the lead.  Pulling out a blackjack, he enters Cell #4, begins wailing on one of the Mexicans -- Dinardo.
32) 2) text: Cheered on by drunks in the tank and his fellow officers, Stensland goes wild.  He's joined by Lentz, Crumley and Tristano.  Shaking his head, Jack Vincennes moves away.
33) 0) text: Bud types his report with one finger.  Jack looks in.
33) 1) dialog: White, you better get a lease on Stens before he kills someone.
34) 0) text: Followed by Jack, Bud forces his way through the crowd. The men who see it's him quickly clear a path. Swigging from a pint of gin, Stensland works skinny GARCIA.  Head saps.  The kid drops to his knees drooling blood. Bud grabs Stensland, hauls him off of Garcia who looks up.
34) 6) text: Cops block Exley's way.  As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks him in the balls.  A dangling shot.  Bud keels into the bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack. Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer, then puts Garcia down with a left-right. Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.
35) 43) dialog: What do I have to do?
35) 46) dialog: The show, sir?
35) 48) text: The Chief just got Jack where he lives.
35) 50) dialog: Okay.  I'll do it.
35) 51) text: Smiles all around.  Loew smiles at the two-way.  A move not lost on Jack who wonders who might be on the other side.
35) 53) text: Jack leaves.  The Chief steps to the mirror, looks through.
36) 0) text: Glasses off, Exley waits, looks up as Jack enters.
36) 1) dialog: You're the key witness?
36) 3) dialog: I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
36) 5) dialog: Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
36) 7) dialog: You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
36) 9) dialog: I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
36) 13) dialog: Just remember, Bud White'll fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.  They already suspended him.  Just pray he cops a deal and stays on the Department because that is one civilian you do not want on your case.
42) 3) text: Chase looks over and winks at Jack who waits in the wings.
42) 5) text: As the kids applaud, Chase joins Jack who gives him a quick drag of a cigarette.  A nervous PA joins them. Chase points out a fetching girl in the second row.
42) 7) text: Chase and Jack watch the PA ask "Sweater" a question while pointing to Chase.  Maybe sixteen, she nods "yes" eagerly.
42) 9) dialog: I won't be there.  They're toning down my profile.
45) 2) text: As the Vice Capt. hands it out for the men to examine, new member Jack Vincennes arrives late.
45) 4) text: The men laugh.  Jack sits, flips a magazine.  Men and women.  Men and men.  Girls and girls.  Girls and horses.
45) 5) dialog: Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
45) 7) dialog: Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
45) 9) dialog: Working whores with squad two.
45) 11) text: Vice Capt. retrieves the magazines, hands them to Jack.
45) 15) text: As they go, Jack sees the books are stamped:  "Fleur-de-L Whatever you desire."  Jack takes the matching business card from his wallet, the one he found on Christmas Eve.
46) 0) text: Jack Vincennes is at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number.
47) 2) dialog: Sid, it's Vincennes.
47) 4) text: INTERCUT WITH Jack at his desk:
47) 5) dialog: No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
47) 7) dialog: Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
47) 8) text: Hudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a magazine like the one Jack has.
47) 10) dialog: What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
47) 12) text: The LINE CLICKS off.  Jack hesitates a moment before cradling the receiver.  Something's not right here.
51) 0) text: Exley sits alone in a sea of desks.  The SQUAWK BOX DRONES.  Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't make it out.  He takes his glasses from the inside of his jacket.  2:00 A.M.  Finally, something to do.  He walks to the wall calendar, tears off Feb. 28 to reveal Mar. 1. As Exley sits, the call SQUAWK BOX booms to life.
63) 8) dialog: If we go by the list, we have about zero chance of making the collar.  But I know a guy who knows what's going on south of Jefferson.  I'm betting he could put us at 50/50.
63) 12) text: Jack stares.  Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a cup.
65) 19) text: If only Jack had been around to hear that.
68) 0) text: A South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.  A BLACK BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the porch.  Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and Exley till they're almost on top of him.
68) 1) dialog: Leonard Bidwell?
68) 3) dialog: How's the left these days?
68) 5) dialog: I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
68) 7) dialog: You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
68) 9) dialog: How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
68) 11) dialog: We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
68) 13) dialog: You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
68) 14) text: Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it off.
68) 16) text: Jack and Exley scan the list.  Jack's finger stabs down on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414."
68) 17) dialog: That's five minutes from here.
71) 0) text: An L-shaped walk-up.  Jack coasts the car to the curb. He leaps out with Exley.  Exley holds up at the sight of a late model sedan.  He leans down to look in the window at the two-way on the dash.
71) 2) dialog: Shit.  Someone beat us here.
71) 3) text: VOICES from the carport ahead.  We see a chrome bumper, the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.  A door slams. Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand.
71) 5) dialog: Hey.
71) 9) dialog: What do you got?
71) 10) text: As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window.
71) 12) text: Jack spots them.  Three shotguns on the passenger side floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills.
71) 13) dialog: So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor, here I come.
72) 0) text: Breuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley bringing up the rear.  Squinting, Exley reaches to his pocket for something.  Not there.
72) 2) dialog: What?
72) 4) dialog: (chuckling) Just don't shoot me.
72) 5) text: The door to 414.  Two men on either side.  Breuning rears back.  Jack rears back.  They kick at the same instant. The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple of flop mattresses.
72) 7) dialog: Freeze!
72) 11) text: Jack and Exley burst into a...
73) 0) text: Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report, memorizing names and dates.  Jack and other brass are also here along with a stenographer.  So's Bud.  One of these guys killed Stensland.  Through tinted glass, the three suspects in three different rooms.
73) 5) text: As Exley steps into the #1 room, Jack joins Dudley.
73) 6) dialog: You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
73) 88) text: Jack turns to Dudley.
73) 89) dialog: He's good.  I'll give him that.
81) 2) text: A sea of dress blues.  Jack looks bored, dressed too flashy for a funeral.  Bud looks grim, rain dripping off the brim of his cap.  As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is FIRED...
91) 0) text: A father holds out his hand, counts along as Jack slaps $100 bills into his palm.  Maybe four thousand dollars. Jack says something about "We appreciate your understanding during this difficult time."  As "Badge of Honor" comes on the TV, the father responds with "Goddamn actors." Leading, Jack looks through an open door where Brett Chase's high school "Sweater Girl" is being comforted by her mother.  As she locks eyes with him an instant...
94) 0) text: A "Badge of Honor" fund-raiser for D.A. Loew's re- election cmpaign.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.  Fishbowls stuffed with cash.  Jack is here, returns a smile half- heartedly.  Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter as Brett "Joe Reno" Chase speaks.
94) 2) text: Applause.  Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes.  Chase then winks knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile. Jack scans the room.  An odd moment as Jack catches his own reflection in a mirror across the way.  He puts a hand to his face.  Is that him?
94) 4) text: Jack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching.
94) 6) dialog: Sid, how are they hanging?
94) 10) text: Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack arrested on Christmas Eve.
94) 12) dialog: What's he doing here, Sid?
94) 14) dialog: Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
94) 16) dialog: And Reynolds?
94) 18) text: Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that.
94) 24) text: Hudgeons heads off.  Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack.
94) 26) dialog: Yeah.
94) 27) text: Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him.  Reynolds' nerves won't let him stay quiet.
94) 29) dialog: Something like that.
94) 31) text: Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth.
94) 32) dialog: Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
94) 34) text: Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information.
94) 35) dialog: Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
94) 37) dialog: Really?  How?
94) 39) dialog: Yeah.  Me neither.
94) 45) text: Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug.
94) 46) dialog: Loew's free.  Congratulate him.
94) 47) text: Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off.  Hudgeons hands Jack a folded slip of paper.
94) 49) text: Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill.  Jack doesn't take it.
94) 50) dialog: Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
94) 52) dialog: Around.
94) 54) text: Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head.
94) 58) dialog: I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
94) 60) dialog: It'll be our secret.
94) 62) text: Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off.  Jack and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew who's captivated.  Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog, gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp
102) 0) text: Jack sits in his car waiting.  He checks his watch... 1:30.  Well past midnight.
102) 1) dialog: Come on, Sid.  Where are you?
102) 2) text: Jack decides.  MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses the street.  The apartment is dark, the front door a few inches ajar.  Suspicious, Jack listens.  Dead quiet.  He enters...
103) 0) text: No one here it seems.  Till Jack nearly trips over a body.  Matt Reynolds.  Soaked in blood.  Throat slit. Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back up at him.  Jack stumbles out the door.  We hear his CAR DOOR SLAM shut, the SCREECH of RUBBER down the street.
104) 0) text: Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on.
104) 1) dialog: It's Vincennes!  Open up!

104) 7) dialog: Shut up!
104) 11) dialog: He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
104) 13) text: Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him.
104) 14) dialog: Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
104) 16) text: Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night.
105) 0) text: The BARTENDER walks down the bar to where Jack arrives.
105) 2) dialog: (pulls out wallet) A bottle of Scotch.
105) 3) text: As the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds is the President Grant fifty.  The things he's done for fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a bottle and shot glass.  He plucks the fifty from Jack's hand. Jack grabs the bottle and starts out.
116) 0) text: Jack sits unshaven and hung-over, the dregs of the Scotch bottle on the desk.  He considers a framed "Badge of Honor" photo:  Jack and Brett Chase, before a banner "To Protect and Serve."  Jack punches a fist through it.
118) 0) text: Sitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962.  He flips one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp.  Jack remembers something Matt Reynolds told him.  He dials the phone.
118) 1) dialog: Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
118) 3) text: As Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him.
118) 5) dialog: Give me a minute, will ya?
118) 7) dialog: Damnit... What?
118) 9) dialog: Even I'm not that crazy.
118) 11) dialog: Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
118) 13) dialog: Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
118) 15) dialog: Yeah.  My whole life.
118) 16) text: Jack stands, heads out.  Exley follows; he needs help.
118) 18) dialog: I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
118) 20) dialog: What?
118) 22) dialog: You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Lieutenant.
118) 23) text: Exley watches as Jack continues down a hall.  Then:
118) 25) text: Jack stops, looks back at him.
118) 26) dialog: Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
118) 28) dialog: So what's the point?
118) 30) text: Jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead.
118) 31) dialog: I don't remember...
118) 33) dialog: I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
118) 35) dialog: The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
118) 37) text: So does Jack.
118) 38) dialog: Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.

123) 2) dialog: Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
123) 3) text: They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin. The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye. They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before...
123) 4) dialog: Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
123) 6) dialog: Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.

124) 18) dialog: She is Lana Turner.
125) 2) text: A moment before Jack begins to laugh.  Exley joins him.
127) 0) text: In a silk robe, the unflappable Pierce Patchett smiles at Exley.  Jack stands alongside.
127) 2) text: A beat.  Exley and Jack don't look like they appreciate being joked with.  Patchett finally sighs.
128) 0) text: Exley and Jack head for the car.
128) 1) dialog: Guy's as cool as they come.
128) 6) dialog: What are you going to do?
128) 8) dialog: Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
131) 2) dialog: Buzz Meeks?
131) 4) dialog: Of him.  He was around when I first joined the force.  A bad egg.
131) 5) text: Pinker could care less.  As Jack's wheels turn...

136) 1) dialog: You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
136) 3) dialog: Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
136) 5) dialog: Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
136) 7) dialog: It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
136) 9) text: Dudley walks over, hands Jack his coffee.
136) 11) dialog: No.
136) 13) text: Jack shakes his head.  Dudley raises a REVOLVER.  He FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart. Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the linoleum. Jack opens his mouth to speak.  His lips form the words, but no sound comes out.  Dudley crouches down beside him.
136) 14) dialog: Have you a valediction, lad?
136) 15) text: Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.  As he dies...
