57) 0) text: Bare.  A table and chair bolted to the floor.  A tough FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat.  On the table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills. Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a couple of short, stiff body shots.  Flatnose is not used to being on the receiving end.  All the same, we get the idea Bud's a bit reluctant. Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.
57) 11) text: Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists.  Wary.  As Breuning steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table.

141) 5) text: Breuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head.
141) 9) text: Breuning cuffs him again.
141) 16) text: Hudgeons flinches as Bud steps up, twice Breuning's size.
141) 28) text: Bud can't hear him.  He uprights the chair one-handed. As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and Dudley.  This is no act.  They can barely hold Bud back.
