6) 0) text: The room is large, over-elaborate, feminine. VIVIAN reclines on a chaise-lounge, showing her legs to good advantage. She is beautiful, giving an impression of strong will and strong emotions, the dangerous unpredictable type. 14. She sips a drink, insolently at ease, watching Marlowe as he enters. Marlowe is still rumpled and sweating. He adopts her be-damned-to-you attitude, looks her over, and sits down unbidden, wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief.
6) 1) dialog: So you're a private detective. I didn't know they existed except in books, or else they were little greedy men snooping around hotels. My, you're a mess, aren't you?
6) 3) dialog: This business of Dad's -- think you can handle it for him?
6) 5) dialog: Really. I would have thought a case like that took a little effort.
6) 7) dialog: Well! what will your first step be?
6) 9) dialog: I didn't know there was a usual one.
6) 11) dialog: You must have read another one on how to be a comedian. I'm quite serious, Mr. Marlowe. My father is not well, and I want this case handled with the least possible worry to him. 15.
6) 13) dialog: I see. No professional secrets. Marlowe doesn't answer. He's still admiring her legs. Vivian sets her glass down, looking him over coolly, as though he were something in a bottle.
6) 14) dialog: How do you like Dad?
6) 16) dialog: He liked Shawn. I suppose you know who Shawn is?
6) 18) dialog: You don't have to play poker with me. Dad wants to find him, doesn't he?
6) 20) dialog: Of course I do! It wasn't right for him to go off like that. Broke Dad's heart, although he won't say much about it. Or did he?
6) 22) dialog: I don't see what there is to be cagey about. And I don't like your manners.
6) 26) dialog: People don't talk like that to me. Marlowe laughs at her softly. His eyes are warm and mocking. Vivian relaxes slowly, looking at him, and something besides fury comes into her own face.
6) 27) dialog: Do you always think you can handle people like trained seals?
6) 29) dialog: Dad didn't want to see you about Shawn at all.
6) 31) dialog: Get out. (as Marlowe rises and turns from her) Please... you could find Shawn if Dad wanted you to.
6) 33) dialog: A month back. He just drove away one afternoon without saying a word. They found his car in some private garage.
6) 35) dialog: (her manner suddenly different, as though she has won her bout with him) Dad didn't tell you then.
6) 37) dialog: I'm sure I don't care what you say.
41) 0) text: A small room, cheaply furnished, with a closed door in on wall. Vivian sits waiting for him, beautifully but simply dressed, quite at ease. She seems in a better humor this Morning, smiling at the surprised Marlowe. 43.
41) 1) dialog: Well, you DO exist, after all. I'd begun to think I dreamed you out of a bottle of bad gin. (with underlying hint of seriousness) I've been trying to get you on the phone all morning.
41) 3) dialog: (apologetically) I was rather rude.
42) 1) dialog: (sitting) You don't put on much of a front.
42) 3) dialog: Oh -- are you honest?
42) 5) dialog: (taking out a cigarette) How did you get into this slimy business, then?
42) 8) dialog: (softly) Poor Owen. So you know about that.
42) 10) dialog: (quietly) Perhaps it wouldn't have been a bad idea. He was in love with her. We don't find much of that in our circle... (changing her tone) But I didn't come to see you about Owen. Do you feel yet that you can tell me what my father wants you to do?
42) 12) dialog: Was it about Carmen?
42) 14) dialog: You'd better look at this anyway. Marlowe examines the envelope. 45.
42) 15) dialog: A messenger brought it this morning.
42) 18) dialog: Five thousand -- for the negative and the rest of the prints. The deal has to be closed tonight, or they give the picture to some scandal sheet.
42) 20) dialog: A woman telephoned me, shortly after this thing was delivered.
42) 22) dialog: Does there have to be something else? Marlowe nods -- his face is uncompromising.
42) 23) dialog: (giving in again) The woman said there was a police jam connected with it, and I'd better lay it on the line fast or I'd be talking to my little sister through a wire screen.
42) 25) dialog: I don't know. 46.
42) 27) dialog: She's at home -- still in bed, I think. She was sick last night.
42) 29) dialog: The servants say she didn't. I was up at Las Olindas across the State line playing roulette at Eddie Mars' Cypress Club. I lost my shirt. (taking another cigarette -- laughing wryly)
42) 31) dialog: Yes, the Sternwoods all like losing games. The Sternwoods can afford to. The Sternwoods have money. (bitterly) All it's bought them is a raincheck.
42) 33) dialog: Nobody knows. He took it without permission. Do you think...?
42) 35) dialog: I can borrow it -- probably from Eddie Mars. (sardonically) There's a bond between us, you see. Shawn Regan ran away with Eddie's blonde wife. 47.
42) 37) dialog: How about telling the police?
42) 39) dialog: The woman said she'd call me back with instructions at five.
42) 41) dialog: Can you do anything?
42) 43) dialog: I like you. You believe in miracles.
42) 45) dialog: I'll have two drinks. Marlowe grins at her. He comes up with a bottle and two glasses, fills them, and takes one to her. They salute, start to drink and find that their eyes have met over the glass rims and refuse to come apart. Vivian breaks it, no because she is shy or coy, but because suddenly there is sadness in her face. Her gaze drops briefly, then returns to Marlowe, clear, steady, and sad. 48.
42) 46) dialog: You're a lot like Shawn Regan. Marlowe looks at her, almost with tenderness and understanding.
42) 48) dialog: What?
42) 50) dialog: It couldn't be -- you.
42) 52) dialog: (rising) I think we've done enough for one day...
42) 54) dialog: (going toward door) No... Marlowe sets his glass down on the desk and picks up the envelope.
42) 56) dialog: (softly) Your face is like Shawn's too -- clean and thin, with hard bones under it... She turns, neither slowly nor fast, away from him, opens the door, and goes out.
48) 20) dialog: I've learned not to believe in anything. I don't need you, Marlowe. I don't know how you got here, but I don't want you. Will you get out? 64.
48) 23) dialog: Joe, I swear I didn't have anything to do...
48) 25) dialog: Marlowe, you're ruining everything.
48) 62) dialog: (to Agnes, trying to watch her and Brody at the same time) Let her alone. (to Brody, moving toward him) Joe, if you dare to hurt her...
48) 81) dialog: (softly) You -- and every other man I ever met. She goes out. Carmen follows her, but at the door she turns impulsively, flings her arms around Marlowe's neck and kisses him.
71) 0) text: leans against small, swank bar, looking into the gambling room, which is big, spacious, various small lay-outs alon the wall. At the end of the big room are three roulette wheels. The two outside ones are deserted; even the croupiers have been drawn into the crowd which is packed densely about the middle one. In the center of the crowd VIVIAN'S HEAD can be seen as she plays her winning streak Marlowe is watching her. On the fringe of the crowd the waiters stand also, watching. All this is a build-up to show a phenomenal run which Vivian is making. The barman leans on the bar behind Marlowe
71) 6) dialog: (looks about, cool, insolent, though her face shows excitement ) What kind of a cheap outfit is this? Get busy and spin the wheel. I want one more play and I'm playing table stakes. You take it away fast enough, I notice. But when it comes to dishing it out, you begin to whine.
71) 8) dialog: It's your money. Don't you want it back?
71) 10) dialog: (turns on him, vicious, cutting) Do you want another sixteen thousand of it? The man falls back, discomfited. A door opens in the wall behind the table. The crowd falls silent, turns, as Mars comes out the door, smiling, indifferent, immaculate, han in his jacket pockets as he strolls to the table.
71) 17) dialog: One more play, Eddie. All of it on the red. I like red. It's the color of blood. Mars stares at her a second, smiles faintly, takes from h inner breast pocket a large pinseal wallet with gold corners, very elegant, and tosses it carelessly to the croupier without opening it.
74) 10) dialog: Yes -- are you?
74) 13) dialog: I came with a man. He's dead drunk. Forget him. What are you doing here, besides playing bodyguard?
74) 15) dialog: What for?
74) 17) dialog: You lie.
75) 2) dialog: (draws him on) I wasn't used to being high-jacked. Give me a little time.
75) 4) dialog: What else? 107.
75) 6) dialog: I feel safer, around the heels I go with.
75) 10) text: The car is going pretty fast, Marlowe intent on the road. Vivian seems nervous, is looking about, smoking.
75) 11) dialog: (smoking nervously) So Eddie had you come all the way up here and then wouldn't tell you what he wanted? (dryly) . . That's right. I'm still lying. Suddenly she flings the cigarette out the window.
75) 12) dialog: Have you got a drink?
75) 14) dialog: (takes flask) I can't drink like this. Stop the car. Marlowe stops the car. 108.
75) 15) dialog: (puts flask unopened back into compartment, slams it shut) I don't want a drink. Let's talk.
75) 17) dialog: Are you?
75) 19) dialog: (easily; lifts the handbag, slaps it) This, for instance. And tonight's not the first time.
75) 21) dialog: Wittier, please, Marlowe. Wittier.
75) 23) dialog: But not old enough to outgrow some of your other habits.
75) 25) dialog: Killing people. (she stares at him, secretive, while he tries to follow her, catch up with what's going on) So you're a killer.
75) 27) dialog: Why not? (she looks at him. Suddenly her manner changes; she speaks with a quiet and complete sincerity) I wish I was sure you had done it. Then I could thank you -- in my father's name. He still has pride, at least.
75) 29) dialog: (with bitter contempt) Carmen and me... (rapidly) We're his blood. That's where the hurt is. That Father might die despising his own blood. It was always wild, but it wasn't always rotten. (she pulls herself together, takes out a cigarette, slumps back in the seat as Marlowe strikes a match. But when he holds the match to her, he sees her lying back in the seat, the cigarette in her mouth, looking at him with lazy and inviting challenge. When he brings the match near, without moving she blows it out. When she speaks it is almost a whisper) Move closer. Marlowe stares at her. After a moment he flings the dead match deliberately away, puts his arm around her approaches his face to hers. Suddenly Vivian flings the unlighted cigarette over her shoulder toward the window, clasps him in her arms.
75) 30) dialog: Hold me close! 110. They kiss, a long kiss. Marlowe raises his head at last.
75) 31) dialog: Where do you live?
75) 33) dialog: I've never seen it.
75) 35) dialog: Yes.
75) 37) dialog: So that's the way it is.
75) 39) dialog: (controls herself; takes out a wisp of handkerchief and scrubs her lips savagely with it) Men have been shot for less than this, Marlowe.
75) 41) dialog: What makes you think Eddie Mars has anything on me? 122. 123. 111.
75) 43) dialog: Do I need to tell you what I think of you, Mister Detective?
75) 45) dialog: Let me congratulate you on keeping your head.
75) 47) dialog: Take me home. Marlowe starts the oar again, drives on.
81) 1) dialog: (rapidly) I've found Shawn. I'm leaving at once to meet him. We'll send you a picture postal from Mexico perhaps. So you can call off the bloodhounds, and many thanks. (she hangs up)
101) 0) text: A small room, in keeping with the exterior -- furnished comfortably but not luxuriously. The only light comes fro a floor lamp beside the davenport where Marlowe lies. His hands are cuffed behind him, his feet roped to the leg of the davenport. He is still out, his face considerably the worse for wear. Vivian sits beside him on a straight chair, holding a half empty glass in her hand. She seems to have forgotten about it. She seems to have forgotten everything but Marlowe -- who begins to come out of it. H opens his eyes presently and looks at Vivian -- he doesn' seem surprised. He winces and shuts his eyes again.
101) 3) dialog: (desperately) Phil, why did you have to go on with this?
101) 5) dialog: I've only known one fool as big as you...
101) 7) dialog: (shakily) Your face looks like a collision met...
101) 18) dialog: You'll get your talk, Phil. Canino's gone for Eddie.
101) 22) dialog: I did it as much for you... Why wouldn't you believe me? Why wouldn't you stop?
101) 24) dialog: Why did I have to meet you? Why out of all the men in the city, did my father have to call you in?
101) 28) dialog: (rising abruptly) Oh, stop it, Phil. Stop it! Nothing's going to happen...
101) 34) dialog: (quietly) Eddie -- this is where I get off.
101) 46) dialog: You don't dare go through with this, Eddie.
101) 48) dialog: You think I'm going to let you get away with it? Mars studies her, then Marlowe -- realizes what the score is, and smiles sardonically.
102) 0) text: As Vivian blows out the first match and drops it casually into an ash tray, shielding the box in her hand from Canino's view. Canino strolls back, looking Marlowe over with sadistic humor.
103) 1) dialog: Canino --
103) 3) dialog: (over above action) Phil! Marlowe throws himself forward into Canino's legs -- they roll, struggling.
106) 2) dialog: (tonelessly) Nothing. The windows are all misted. They come steadily closer to the dark car. Suddenly Vivia stops, rigid, and lets go a thin, tearing scream.
106) 3) dialog: Behind the wheel! (as though pleading with Marlowe not to fire) Phil! Canino shoves her roughly aside, dropping to one knee, an pours three SHOTS through the car window. His gun is now empty. No shots answer him -- he is satisfied that Marlow is dead. He rises, moving to open the car door, as Marlow emerges from behind the car. 171. 146.
106) 7) dialog: (dully) I don't know why I cared. She turns and walks away from him toward the garage and h car, not looking back. Presently Marlowe goes back into the house. FADE OUT.
107) 3) dialog: I'd like to see you, Mr. Marlowe. She gives Norris the nod -- he goes away, and Marlowe follows Vivian into the room, closing the door.
108) 0) text: Lavishly furnished. Vivian also looks exhausted, stony, but giving an impression of submerged but volcanic emotio She does not look at Marlowe.
108) 1) dialog: Well?
108) 3) dialog: (looking at him now, forced to admire him) It wasn't as easy as you make it sound.
108) 5) dialog: (after an uncomfortable pause) It's too bad Father can't know what you've done for him. I'm afraid he's... angry with you.
108) 7) dialog: You -- won't say anything to him? 148.
108) 9) dialog: Phil...
108) 11) dialog: (going close to him) Phil -- I didn't kill Shawn Regan.
108) 13) dialog: (very calmly) It's quite possible. He's been gone a long time, and he's not a peaceful man. (turning away) I'll send you my personal check in the morning, Mr. Marlowe.
108) 15) dialog: I'm sure my father would wish you to be repaid for your... extra services, last night.
108) 17) dialog: What about him? 173. 174. 149.
108) 19) dialog: I'm tired, too. Get out, Marlowe. Marlowe shrugs, goes toward the door. He speaks over his shoulder with an air of casual politeness.
108) 21) dialog: She's fine. She went up to Santa Barbara last night.
108) 23) dialog: Yes. There seems to be nothing more to say. Marlowe exits.
113) 0) text: as Marlowe admits Vivian. She is obviously in a fine stat of nerves. She enters quickly -- he shuts the door.
113) 1) dialog: Phil...
113) 3) dialog: Eddie Mars just called me. He's out to get you.
113) 5) dialog: But now you must believe it. You must get out of town -- now.
113) 7) dialog: Phil, how do you feel about me?
113) 9) dialog: I got a different idea last night. Or maybe you're not a man except when two or three people are trying to murder you. They kiss -- one of those kisses. Vivian frees herself.
113) 10) dialog: Now go. At once. I'll give you Money -- a thousand -- five thousand if you'll get out of town now -- today... 158.
113) 12) dialog: Would you get out of town if you knew Shawn Regan was dead?
113) 14) dialog: Would you?
113) 16) dialog: Kiss me.
113) 18) dialog: I killed him. By accident. He was teaching me to shoot and the gun went off.
113) 22) dialog: You fool, I killed him, I tell you. Just as you're going to be dead if you don't get out of town. Don't you see Eddie Mars can't let you stay alive now? 159.
113) 24) dialog: There's no game -- with you.
113) 26) dialog: That's a lie. I'm trying to play straight now. You fool, don't you realize you're going to die if you stay here?
113) 29) dialog: You're going to find Shawn Regan?
113) 31) dialog: No matter who gets hurt?
113) 33) dialog: (letting her hands drop to his shoulders) All right, Phil. It's funny -- I think I really like you now, for the first time. She turns to the door, her head high, her voice very cool and steady. Only her eyes, hidden from Marlowe, tell how she feels.
113) 34) dialog: Goodbye, Phil. She goes out.
123) 3) dialog: Phil --
123) 7) dialog: Poor Carmen. Even after that -- that -- Tell me it was quick.
123) 10) dialog: I know. Would you really have sent her to -- to the --
123) 12) dialog: Yes, I know.
123) 14) dialog: Only it was my fifteen thousand. I pawned the jewels mother left me. I still have Shawn's money, hoping to find his relatives -- if he had relatives. Not that it matters. I know what you must think of me.
123) 16) dialog: I had prayers said for him in the Cathedral. And I brought the Father out here, too. I couldn't lie to him. He stood beside the sump and blessed Shawn. I prayed too -- for me, at least. Marlowe puts his hand under her chin, tilting her head back.
123) 18) dialog: (rising) Yes. We must tell father --
124) 13) dialog: Phil -- they're here.
