As she does so, Marlowe rises, shifts the chair in doing so, so that to her surprise, Carmen finds herself sitting in the chair itself. She stares up, surprised and then angrily, is about to speak again when they both see Norri He has just entered noiselessly, stands beside the chair. On Norris' face there is now a curious expression of grie sadness. Carmen glances up at him, rises quickly as if he had reprimanded her with words, and exits. Marlowe looks after her, thoughtful, a little grim.

Low bookshelves, a desk, thick rug floor cushions, low divans -- an exotic messy atmosphere. 27. On a low dais at one end of the room is a carved teakwood chair, a massive thing in which Carmen Sternwood sits, rigidly erect, in the pose of an Egyptian goddess. She wears a man's large silk dressing gown -- it doesn't pretend to fit her and gives the impression of having bee thrown hurriedly around her by someone other than herself Carmen's eyes have a queer fixed stare. She pays no attention to Marlowe. She looks as if, in her mind, she i doing something very important and doing it well. She seems pleased about it, her lips curved to a smile. She laughs from time to time -- softly, secretly. Opposite her, Geiger lies on the floor in front of a thin like a totem pole. The eye of the totem is a camera lens; it focuses on the chair where Carmen sits. A blackened flash bulb is clipped to the totem beside it. Geiger is dressed in semi-oriental fashion. His embroidered coat is soaked with blood. He is obviously dead. Marlowe takes all this in, sniffs the air. It is heavy with something unpleasant. He crosses to a small lacquer table bearing a flagon of dark liquid and two glasses. Marlowe sniffs the flagon, makes a grimace of disgust. Carmen's clothes are wadded up on the divan. Marlowe pick up her coat and shoes and goes to her.

On the way out he pushes down the light switch by the door, and kick the door shut behind him.
24) 0) text: Marlowe has just rung the doorbell. In the drive behind him stands Carmen's Packard. The door opens. Norris appears in it, recognizes Marlowe, looks swiftly past him and recognizes the car also. Then he looks at Marlowe again -- the same quiet, grave face with its expression of grief and sadness which the sight of the ca brought into it. His voice though is quiet and calm.

Presently, in b.g. in front of Geiger's house, Carmen Sternwood appears furtively around the far end of the hedge, and goes quickly in through the gap leading to the front door.

77) 12) dialog: (slipping off her wrap) I'm not going. She looks at him -- a surprisingly honest, steady look. This is a different Carmen -- a puzzled, half-frightened girl who seems to be waking from a dream -- not sure she wants to, but unable to help herself. Marlowe looks back at her, nastily. But he senses a difference, and his voic is surprisingly gentle when he speaks. 113.

77) 31) dialog: (obediently) All right. She puts her thumb in her mouth, or her hand to her face such a way as to appear to be sucking her thumb as usual. Marlowe takes up the fallen wrap and approaches with it. 115.
77) 33) dialog: (giggling) It's not my thumb. See? She removes the object from her mouth and holds it up for him to see. It is the white queen from his set of chessmen. Marlowe stares at her for a moment, then he slaps her terrifically across the face, rocking her back. The chessman falls from her hand and she stares at Marlow frightened now, as he walks toward her.

He examines his hand, is still no satisfied, jerks open shaving cabinet, looks at the innocuous bottles of mouthwash, etc., when what he needs carbolic acid, goes to the kitchen while the knocking sti continues, jerks savagely from the shelf his last bottle whiskey. It is about half full. He jerks the stopper out, flings i away and pours about a dollar's worth of expensive Scotch over his hand, flings the bottle away, returns to the living room, and while the KNOCKING STILL CONTINUES, he kneels at the hearth, lays the delicate chess piece on it and with a heavy fire-dog hammers the chess-piece into dust, still beating even after the piece has vanished, hi blows at last drowning out the SOUND of the knocking on t door. 124. 125. 116.

119) 14) dialog: Maybe if everything had been different -- if I hadn't been born a Sternwood, if my mother had lived -- if I'd known a man like you before... Oh, Phil, is there ever any way back?
119) 16) dialog: (softly, intensely serious) You could help me find the way. He looks at her, saying nothing. She comes closer to him, childlike, pleading.
119) 17) dialog: Phil, you've got to help me. I'm getting lost. I don't know where I'm going any more, and I'm scared.
119) 19) dialog: Because... Just because you came into the house, and I saw you. Just a little thing like that. Don't you understand, Phil? You've got something I need, some thing I've got to have. Strength, maybe. I don't know. But I've got to have it, or -- I don't know what's going to happen to me. She puts her hands on his chest, looking up into his face. For once she's completely honest.
119) 21) dialog: Perhaps... Phil... 164.
119) 24) dialog: (dully) what?
119) 27) dialog: (taking the gun) Thanks. Marlowe moves past her, as though to open the door.

119) 44) dialog: Because Vivian won't let you. And you won't do it, anyhow. You like my father, just as Shawn did. You know what would happen if you took me into court. Pictures, and long columns in the newspapers, and the Sternwood name all over the headlines. You know what that would do to father. A pause. She is looking at him like a wicked changeling.
119) 45) dialog: And Vivian's in on this, too. Way in. You wouldn't want to see her go to prison.
119) 48) dialog: Thanks. She puts them on quickly, then stands looking at Marlowe.
119) 49) dialog: I think I'm glad I didn't kill you. This is going to eat you. You're going to lie awake nights, thinking about it. And every so often you'll see me somewhere, and I'll laugh at you... Goodbye, Phil. She turns quickly toward door. Marlowe steps quickly to the light switch. As she opens the door and steps through it, he snaps off the light. There is a brief pause -- the gun fire. 188. 189. 190. 167.

Marlowe stands in the door, facin Mars across Carmen's body as Mars reacts.
