Worn stone steps lead to a rotting open porch. An equally ragged '48 Chevy Aerosedan sits in the driveway. Behind the house lies a void of evergreen and leafless birch. Far down the road, lies a lone neighborhood house. There are only two houses on this street. Here, Christmas lights are strung, but many of the fat bulbs are burned out. The building appears like a haunted house on Christmas Eve. The windows are dark, except for a pale blue light in the living room..
2) 1) text: Billy's mother sits in the corner of the couch, cigarette in one hand, a Screwdriver in a highball glass in the other. The room is lit only by the lights of the Christmas tree. In the b.g., the bassinet is long gone. Billy's father, appearing haggard, helps his five year old son, BILLY, place the plate beneath the pink aluminum Christmas tree. Billy's back is to CAMERA and partially obscured by the tree branches. He wears long sleeve pajamas.

Colquitt moves directly toward the fallen Christmas tree, attending to Agnes. Bludworth continues to the kitchen. Bludworth freezes, expression mortified. CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Billy sitting at the table in the dark; drinking a glass of milk and eating... his Christmas cookies, appearing like shapes of charred jerky with frosting and sprinkles. As Billy calmly finishes his snack, CAMERA CRANES DOWN until the corpse of his mother ENTERS THE F.G...
33) 8) text: What a laugh it would have been/ if daddy had only seen/Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night! CAMERA TRACKS parallel to the rooms, REVEALING a window in which hangs a small holly wreath with white micro lights. MEGAN HELMS, 23, can be seen pacing angrily while on her cell phone. Although furious with whomever is on the receiving end, Megan is clearly trying to keep her voice DOWN. She pulls the phone away and flips it off before hanging up. CAMERA MOVES PAST HER WINDOW just as Megan sits at her desk before an open laptop and looks sickened, at the monitor. The next room is dark, yet not vacant. Attractive and urban, LAUREN HANNON, 21, leans out over the sill of her open window smoking a cigarette. CAMERA CONTINUES as she shudders at the mounting storm and exhales, somewhat sad, before dropping the butt into a beer bottle. CAMERA CONTINUES TO the next room in which CLAIR CROSBY, 20, appears excited, yet anxious while pacing with a sheet of high quality gift wrapping paper, cellophane tape, ribbons and scissors. As she sits, Clair disappears from view... CAMERA BEGINS RISING... toward the third story, while also PUSHING IN ON a gabled window framed with Christmas lights on the top level of the house. Behind the weathered mutins stands an illuminated plastic Santa Claus. The window is ajar; softly KNOCKING against the sill... 34 35 36 17. From the dim spill of the decorative lights, it is apparent the large area behind the window is not a living space, but, rather, the attic which was once Billy Lenz's room.

42) 61) dialog: In sorority terms, EVE GUARALDI, 23, is a "mistake." A quiet girl whom events in her life could have caused her either to blossom into a social butterfly or a sullen creepy misfit. The latter is the case. The lenses of her glasses are thick, suggesting a past injury rather than merely vision dysfunction. Eve's physical features could pass for an adult Agnes. 32. Wearing a coat and duffel bag over her shoulder, Eve appears ready to leave. She extends a present, wrapped in newspaper, to Heather.

Heather has difficulty with her own footing while helping Ms. Mac to her feet.

Once outside, the wind WHISTLES... the storm settling. CAMERA now RISES, leaving Kelli and Leigh, still staring at the phone. They CLEAR FRAME as CAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE UP a brick wall until eight plastic illuminated reindeer and a Santa Claus appear on the roof against the dark snowy sky. Seeing when you're sleeping. Knowing... when you're awake.
