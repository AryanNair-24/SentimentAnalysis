CAMERA TRACKS parallel to the rooms, REVEALING a window in which hangs a small holly wreath with white micro lights. MEGAN HELMS, 23, can be seen pacing angrily while on her cell phone. Although furious with whomever is on the receiving end, Megan is clearly trying to keep her voice DOWN. She pulls the phone away and flips it off before hanging up. CAMERA MOVES PAST HER WINDOW just as Megan sits at her desk before an open laptop and looks sickened, at the monitor. The next room is dark, yet not vacant. Attractive and urban, LAUREN HANNON, 21, leans out over the sill of her open window smoking a cigarette. CAMERA CONTINUES as she shudders at the mounting storm and exhales, somewhat sad, before dropping the butt into a beer bottle. CAMERA CONTINUES TO the next room in which CLAIR CROSBY, 20, appears excited, yet anxious while pacing with a sheet of high quality gift wrapping paper, cellophane tape, ribbons and scissors. As she sits, Clair disappears from view... CAMERA BEGINS RISING... toward the third story, while also PUSHING IN ON a gabled window framed with Christmas lights on the top level of the house. Behind the weathered mutins stands an illuminated plastic Santa Claus. The window is ajar; softly KNOCKING against the sill... 34 35 36 17. From the dim spill of the decorative lights, it is apparent the large area behind the window is not a living space, but, rather, the attic which was once Billy Lenz's room.

47) 0) text: CAMERA MOVES ALONG the base of the house, then TILTS up along a lattice, covered with bare Winter vines, running the height of the house seemingly to Megan's second level window with the small holly wreath and white micro lights, yet, also, the plastic Santa stands entry just above in the attic window. A gloved hand reaches out and takes hold of the lattice. CAMERA RISES, as the unseen figure begins to climb...
48) 0) text: CAMERA IS LOW, near the floor and obliquely angled; 49PT voyeuristic. The texture within THE FRAME is grainy and coarse. A bed is in the b.g., the lighting is low. Visible IN FRAME, a poster of "Alex de Large," Malcolm McDowell in "Clockwork Orange," false eyelash accentuating his maniacal eye, is set directly over the bed with clear push pins. Megan ENTERS FRAME and sits on the bed... CAMERA BEGINS PULLING BACK REVEALING CAMERA has actually been watching Megan's laptop monitor.

54) 0) text: Megan listens to Kelli's MUTED VOICE. 0.S., another THUMP. O.S... the MUTED tinkle of a music box playing "DANCE OF THE SUGAR PLUM FAIRY" begins. Megan holds, listening to locate its origin. Then, as suddenly as it began... the MUSIC stops.
56) 1) dialog: Waits for Kelli to move off, then returns to the window... The MUSIC starts, again. Puzzled, Megan listens. She moves away from the window and toward the center of the room. The ghostly SOUND seems to emanate from within the wall. The MUSIC begins travelling, up the wall and to the ceiling.

Megan rises into the attic, her breath exhaust can be seen in the cold. The MUSIC BOX sounds clean; definitely in this room.

64) 5) dialog: Clair..? What are you doing? From the darkness, a Hefty trash bag WHIPS over Megan's head. The FRAME TURNS BLACK, as if having CUT TO BLACK, however, MEGAN'S HORRIFIED BREATHS remain amplified and intensely PRESENT. Then, a sickening THRUST RIPS a hole in the bag... A tear erupts in the upper corner of FRAME, exposing the back of the illuminated plastic Santa. ANOTHER THRUST! RIP! A second tear slashes ACROSS FRAME... THRASHING, CAMERA, through the two puncture holes, CATCHES flashes of the killer's legs... macabre sparkles of tinsel... the posed dead body of Clair placed in the rocking chair... The silhouetted killer reaches out as if holding Megan still. The other arm cocks backward with a clawed hammer and slings toward the bag...

Although lacking the polish of a frat brother, Kyle is no dope. He's bad boy handsome; blue collar smarts. In the b.g., Megan's window is closed.
