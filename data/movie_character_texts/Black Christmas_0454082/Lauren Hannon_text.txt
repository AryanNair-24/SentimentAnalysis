33) 8) text: What a laugh it would have been/ if daddy had only seen/Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night! CAMERA TRACKS parallel to the rooms, REVEALING a window in which hangs a small holly wreath with white micro lights. MEGAN HELMS, 23, can be seen pacing angrily while on her cell phone. Although furious with whomever is on the receiving end, Megan is clearly trying to keep her voice DOWN. She pulls the phone away and flips it off before hanging up. CAMERA MOVES PAST HER WINDOW just as Megan sits at her desk before an open laptop and looks sickened, at the monitor. The next room is dark, yet not vacant. Attractive and urban, LAUREN HANNON, 21, leans out over the sill of her open window smoking a cigarette. CAMERA CONTINUES as she shudders at the mounting storm and exhales, somewhat sad, before dropping the butt into a beer bottle. CAMERA CONTINUES TO the next room in which CLAIR CROSBY, 20, appears excited, yet anxious while pacing with a sheet of high quality gift wrapping paper, cellophane tape, ribbons and scissors. As she sits, Clair disappears from view... CAMERA BEGINS RISING... toward the third story, while also PUSHING IN ON a gabled window framed with Christmas lights on the top level of the house. Behind the weathered mutins stands an illuminated plastic Santa Claus. The window is ajar; softly KNOCKING against the sill... 34 35 36 17. From the dim spill of the decorative lights, it is apparent the large area behind the window is not a living space, but, rather, the attic which was once Billy Lenz's room.

The PHONE ERUPTS with a nightmarish cacophony of VOICES; women, men, a crying baby. INSANE and DEMONIC; intertwined with one another. GROANS, DISTANT SHRIEKS, CACKLES; it SOUNDS as if a Dore etching of Hell could speak. Meanwhile, Bing Crosby's rendition of "I'll Be Home For Christmas" plays low on the living room C.D. Meant to be comforting, it subliminally adds to the tension... CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the stunned Phi Kappa sisters' FACES listening to the awful SOUNDS emitting from the phone. Then, cutting through the STATIC of eerie VOICES... yet remaining distant... a VOICE... neither male or female, yet an absolutely crone-like cackle...
42) 37) dialog: Hey, shouldn't you get goin'? Don't you have lots of toys to deliver tonight to good little boys and girls? While Melissa LAUGHS, Dana and Ms. Mac gesture for Lauren to hang up.
