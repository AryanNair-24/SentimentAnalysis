6) 6) dialog: The kind with a brush. Travis appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNK to enter without making physical contact - something Trav would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people an this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his feelings rise to the surface. Wizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave.
6) 7) dialog: Travis.
6) 10) dialog: (ironic)
6) 12) dialog: (continuing)
6) 15) dialog: Yeah.
6) 19) dialog: Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.

6) 29) dialog: Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
6) 31) dialog: Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
6) 35) dialog: She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? but she stiffed me. A real skunk.
6) 37) dialog: (paternal)
6) 41) dialog: We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.

6) 68) dialog: The cops and company raise hell they find out. Travis drops two Alka-Seltzer into his glass of water.
6) 70) dialog: For a fee.
6) 72) dialog: I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
6) 75) dialog: What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
6) 77) text: nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. (nods to Charlie T.)
18) 40) dialog: You know Eddie, he's the new hippie kid in our group, long hair... Wizard demonstrates length of hair and others nod.

18) 47) dialog: McCall says. "How much on the meter?"  Eddie comes back and says "Two-fifty." McCall says, "Is she worth it". More laughter.
18) 49) dialog: And the kid says, "Yeah.  She's about 19, good-lookin."  McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
18) 51) dialog: McCall says, "Well, if you want some help I'll see if I can send some units out."
18) 56) dialog: She was just a kid.  Stoned, you know. Travis, carrying his coffee and pastries, walks over to their table.  Charlie T spots him.
18) 58) dialog: You're getting a rep, Travis. TRAVIS sits down and the other CABBIES resume their conversation.
18) 60) dialog: (to Travis)
18) 64) dialog: (joking)
18) 72) text: It's a living. WIZARD gets up to leave.

18) 96) dialog: (nods)
18) 99) dialog: Travis, look, I dig it.  Let me explain.  You choose a certain way of life.  You live it.  It becomes what you are.  I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night.

18) 100) dialog: (continuing)
18) 103) text: That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
18) 104) dialog: What do you expect, Bertrand Russell?  I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know? (a beat)
18) 109) dialog: You fit in.  It's lonely, it's rough at first.  But you fit in. You got no choice.
