3) 5) dialog: Tom, come here a moment. (he walks over)
3) 9) dialog: Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
3) 11) dialog: (as if instructing a child)
3) 14) dialog: No, I didn't forget "sexy".
3) 16) dialog: Oh, Tom, please.

What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it. Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she se across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out across the street again.

8) 3) dialog: (putting on glasses)
8) 7) dialog: (giggling)
8) 10) dialog: No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
8) 12) dialog: He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when -
8) 16) dialog: No, why?
8) 18) dialog: He's Black, OK?
8) 20) dialog: As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
8) 22) dialog: Why don't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary?
8) 24) dialog: First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
8) 28) dialog: No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
8) 30) dialog: No, this is young - well, I'm never sure how old Black people are - but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.

9) 21) dialog: You want to canvass?
9) 25) dialog: How do you feel about Senator Palantine's stand on welfare? This takes TRAVIS back a bit.  He obviously doesn't have slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever. TRAVIS thinks a moment, then improvises an answer:
9) 27) dialog: Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.

9) 38) text: If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me. Betsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis. She is curious, intrigued, tantalized. Like a moth, she draws closer to the flame.
9) 39) dialog: Why?
9) 41) text: Travis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glo It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm unknown even to himself.  Betsy is completely disarmed.
9) 42) dialog: I don't know...
9) 44) dialog: (smiles)
9) 48) text: And... ah... Betsy...

10) 14) dialog: After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
10) 19) dialog: What kind of people?
10) 22) dialog: Really?
10) 24) dialog: What did you do?
10) 26) dialog: That's really something.
10) 28) dialog: The moon?
10) 33) text: It's like you're not even there, not even a person. Nobody knows you. Betsy cuts Travis' bitterness short:
10) 34) dialog: Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
10) 36) dialog: Huh?
10) 38) dialog: Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
10) 40) dialog: You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
10) 44) dialog: The DMZ?
10) 46) dialog: That would have been quite a coincidence.
10) 48) dialog: Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
10) 50) dialog: That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
