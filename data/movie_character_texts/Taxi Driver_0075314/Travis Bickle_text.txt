He must enjoy these schizoid emotions, because his eyes dwell on the couple.

9) 22) dialog: Yes, mam.
9) 26) dialog: Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's right. People should work for a living. I do. I like to work. Every day. Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change. Betsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly Palantine's position on welfare. She remain intrigued by Travis.

9) 40) dialog: Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. (smiles)

10) 5) dialog: I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm Gonna Organezizied". Travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation, than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. The ve sight of it makes one's heart proud. Betsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin. Travis contagious, quicksilver moods cause:
10) 7) text: Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
10) 8) dialog: I can believe that.
10) 10) dialog: (evasive)
10) 13) dialog: I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.

10) 25) dialog: I shot the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
10) 27) dialog: Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
10) 29) dialog: The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was - the full moon. Betsy laughs. Travis continues:
10) 32) dialog: Oh, yeah. People will do anything in front of a taxi driver. I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you. (a bitterness emerges)
10) 33) text: It's like you're not even there, not even a person. Nobody knows you. Betsy cuts Travis' bitterness short:
10) 35) dialog: I know. I could have picked you up.
10) 37) dialog: Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
10) 39) dialog: No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks. Betsy, realizing Travis remembers her precisely, scramble for a polite rationale for her behavior:
10) 41) dialog: If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
10) 45) dialog: South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
10) 47) dialog: You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
10) 49) dialog: I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
10) 51) dialog: Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab. (remembering)
10) 57) dialog: I work a single, which means there's no replacement - no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
10) 60) dialog: Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
10) 62) dialog: (big affectionate smile)
10) 65) dialog: What?
10) 67) dialog: I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
10) 68) dialog: I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
10) 69) dialog: (more at ease)
10) 74) dialog: Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.

Queens is better, Brooklyn is best. go for the guys with suitcases. The rich are the worst tippers, hooks are lousy. Spooks are okay, but they don't live at Park Ave after all. The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says soft "192 East 89".  We take off with another jolt. Cross back 9th Ave, then cut through the park. We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string together? Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be $1.40 fare. Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the numbers - 134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40. Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quar and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35. The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We ta off again with a jolt. This is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a doze instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are these objects? EXT. TRAVIS' TAXI speed down darkened street. Travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza.
10) 84) dialog: I called Betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. That's my day off. At first she hesitated, but I called her again and she agreed. (pause)
10) 85) text: Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name again.  Damn. I've got to remember stuff like that. Travis' thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter Travi cab. He activates the meter and pulls off.
10) 89) dialog: (interrupting)
10) 95) dialog: Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
10) 97) text: Why, thank you Travis.
10) 98) dialog: I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. (a beat)
10) 101) text: I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
10) 103) text: And in some other places too... Palantine, his Assistant and Tom all laugh. Palantine, quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to Travis:
10) 105) dialog: I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
10) 107) dialog: (thinks)
10) 112) dialog: Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess.  Flush it out. Palantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in tracks. He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries to give it some meaning.
10) 114) text: I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
10) 115) dialog: (turning the wheel)

12) 15) dialog: No. (sly smile)
12) 16) text: I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player. Betsy's face backtracks a bit. Maybe she was wrong to go with this fellow she doesn't know. She makes a polite laugh. LATER.  Travis and Betsy are in TIMES SQUARE, turning the corner from Broadway to 42nd Street. Travis carries the album under his arm. They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual". The bo office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled wit explicit publicity stills.  Offending portions have been blocked out with black tape. Travis steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets. Betsy, befuddled, watches him. She doesn't know what to s Travis returns with the tickets.

12) 38) dialog: This is sort of high class...
12) 40) dialog: (hesitant)
12) 43) dialog: We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty... Travis gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marque but is interrupted by Betsy:
12) 47) dialog: ... there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.

A drama is acted out at PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS: Travis, groggy and red-eyed from lack of sleep, walks into the campaign headquarters about NOONTIME.

In high school he sold lottery tickets in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand gun Andy holds the Magnum out for Travis' inspection. There's worshipful CLOSEUP of the .44 Magnum. It is a monster. Travis hefts the huge gun. It seems out of place in his h It is built on Michelangelo's scale. The Magnum belongs i the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver.

14) 54) dialog: Total organization is necessary. Every muscle must be tight.
15) 0) text: The CRACKING SOUND of rapid-fire pistol shots fills the musty air of the firing range. The walls are heavily soundproofed, and sawdust is spread over the floor. Travis stands rock solid, firing the .44 Magnum at an arm length.  With each blasting discharge from the Magnum, Travis' body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each reco from the giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity Travis fires the Magnum as quickly as he can re-set, re-a and re-fire. The Magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks the .38 Special and begins firing as soon as he can aim. After the .38, comes the .25: It is as if he were in a contest to see how quickly he can fire the pistols. After all the guns are discharged, he begins reloading them without a moment's hesitation.

TRAVIS, his shirt still revealing his bare chest, sits on his straight-backed chair watching the TV. The .4 Magnum rests on his lap. The TV is Broadcasting ROCK TIME, a late afternoon local teenage dance and rock show.  On screen YOUNG TEENYBOPPER are dancing, and the TV CAMERAMAN, as any devotee of the genre knows, is relentlessly ZOOMING-IN on their firm you breasts, fannies and crotches -- a sensibility which refl TRAVIS' own. These supper-hour rock dance shows are the m unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium h yet developed. The HARD ROCK NUMBER ends, and the TV CAMERA CUTS TO the local DISC JOCKEY, a hirsute plastic-looking man about 35 FIVE scrumptious TEENYBOPPERS are literally hanging on hi shoulders and arms, their faces turned up to him in drool awe. Out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc jockey blather.

18) 2) text: Mmm, that's good.  Ahh, ahh, more ... TRAVIS averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes to graphic.  Placing his stiffened right hand beside his eye TRAVIS can, by turning it inward, shut off or open up his field of vision by small degrees. MOVIE VOICE DIMINISHES, replaced by SOUND of TRAVIS' voic over.

As the CAMERA reaches the end of its track, it finds TRAV standing, his shirt open, but the mattress.  He is wearin the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand. In the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a less in gunmanship: TRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his holster and firing it. He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and pract withdrawing it.  He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's leng tightening his forearm muscles. He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his inner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behin the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activa sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm.  H has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism an now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidde He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a sli in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly. He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater a jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide all the handguns he wishes to carry.  Finally, wearing tw western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscu the location of all three guns, although he resembles a hunter bundled up against the Arctic winter. He sits at the table dum-dumming the .44 bullets -- cutti "x's" across the bullet heads. P.O.V.: he scans the objects of his room through the scop of the .38. TRAVIS stands in the middle of his apartment, staring at PALANTINE wall.  His eyes are glazed with introspection; sees nothing but himself.

He overhears a VOICE as he looks at the sandwiches. When TRAVIS returns to the counter with the chocolate mil and a sandwich in one hand, he sees a YOUNG BLACK MAN holding a gun on 'Melio.  The STICK-UP MAN is nervous, hopped-up, or both; he bounces on the balls of his cheap worn black tennis shoes -- a strung-out junkie on a desperation ride.  The STICK-UP MAN, a thorough unprofessional, doesn't notice TRAVIS. 'MELIO watches the STICK-UP MAN closely, deciding what to himself.

TRAVIS, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game w the television set. He places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon cr which supports the TV.

19) 84) text: His name is Sport.  Go talk to him. I'll wait here. Travis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport, standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket.  Travis walks toward him. Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a black pimp.  His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snap He sings to him self, "Going to the chapel, gonna get married..." His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and venal.  He could only seem romantic to a confused underag runaway.

19) 164) text: I can help you. IRIS lowers her head to go down on TRAVIS.  TRAVIS, seein this, jumps up in panic. TRAVIS stands several feet from IRIS.  His fly is still open, and the white of his underwear shows through his je He is starting to come apart.
