16) 9) dialog: Come on, mister, let's get outta here -- quick. TRAVIS moves to activate the meter, when the rear door op IRIS is helped out of the cab by a MAN TRAVIS cannot see.
16) 11) text: Come on, baby, let's go.  This is all a real drag. IRIS lets herself be taken out of the cab.  The rear door closes. Sport leans partially in the front window, throwing somet on the front seat.  TRAVIS looks: it is a crumpled $20 bi
19) 79) dialog: You looking for some action?
19) 81) dialog: (eyeing him)
19) 84) text: His name is Sport.  Go talk to him. I'll wait here. Travis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport, standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket.  Travis walks toward him. Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a black pimp.  His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snap He sings to him self, "Going to the chapel, gonna get married..." His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and venal.  He could only seem romantic to a confused underag runaway.
19) 102) text: TRAVIS walks back to IRIS. IRIS motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does. IRIS and TRAVIS turn the corner and walk about a block, saying nothing.  IRIS turns into a darkened doorway and TRAVIS follows her. At the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dim lit hallway.  On either side are doors with apartment numbers.  IRIS turns toward the first door, No. 2.
19) 103) dialog: This is my room.
19) 111) text: I'm keepin' time. TRAVIS enters No. 2 with IRIS. TRAVIS looks around IRIS' room: although dimly lit, the r is brightly decorated.  There is an orange shag carpet, d brown walls and an old red velvet sofa.  On the walls are posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda.  A Nei Young album is playing on a small phonograph. This is where IRIS lives: it bears the individual touch o young girl. IRIS lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places i in an ashtray on the bedstand.
19) 113) dialog: A girl needs protection.
19) 115) dialog: (shrugs)
19) 121) dialog: Easy.
19) 123) dialog: It's easy to remember.  Easy Lay.
19) 125) dialog: I don't like my real name.
19) 128) dialog: Iris.
19) 130) dialog: That's what you think. IRIS unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic breasts -- two young doves hiding from a winter wind. TRAVIS is unnerved by her partial nudity.
19) 132) dialog: (examining him)
19) 137) dialog: No.
19) 139) dialog: I don't remember.
19) 141) dialog: We better make it, or Sport'll get mad.  How do you want to make it?
19) 144) dialog: You want to make it like this? (goes for his fly)
19) 148) dialog: Why should I want to get out of here?  This is where I live.
19) 151) dialog: I musta been stoned.
19) 155) dialog: (reproving)
19) 156) text: Oh, come off it, man. IRIS tries to unzip TRAVIS' fly.  This only unnerves TRAV more: sexual contact is something he's never really confronted.
19) 158) dialog: Don't you want to make it? (a beat)
19) 159) text: Can't you make it? IRIS works on TRAVIS' crotch OFF CAMERA.  He bats her han away.
19) 161) text: I want to help you. TRAVIS is getting increasingly panicked, but IRIS only thinks this is part of his particular thing and tries to overcome it.
19) 162) dialog: (catching on)
19) 164) text: I can help you. IRIS lowers her head to go down on TRAVIS.  TRAVIS, seein this, jumps up in panic. TRAVIS stands several feet from IRIS.  His fly is still open, and the white of his underwear shows through his je He is starting to come apart.
19) 166) dialog: (confused)
19) 171) dialog: You don't have to make it, mister. TRAVIS rests a moment, collecting himself.  Finally, he s
19) 174) dialog: I think so.  I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
19) 176) dialog: I can leave anytime I want.
19) 178) dialog: I was stoned.  That's why they stopped me.  When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go.  They just protect me from myself. There is a pause.  TRAVIS smiles and shrugs apologeticall TRAVIS looks at Iris' cigarette.  It's burning down to th butt.
19) 180) dialog: (compassionate)
19) 184) dialog: That's not hard to do.
19) 188) dialog: Sure.  All right.  We'll have breakfast.  I get up about one o'clock.  Tomorrow.
19) 190) text: Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a... IRIS is interfering with TRAVIS' assassination schedule.
19) 191) dialog: Well, you want to or not?
19) 193) text: O.K. It's a date.  I'll see you here, then. TRAVIS turns; IRIS smiles.
19) 195) dialog: Yes?

19) 199) text: Sweet Iris. (smiles)
22) 4) dialog: ... and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
22) 6) dialog: I got so many sunglasses.  I couldn't live without my shades, man.  I must have twelve pair of shades. She finds a pink-tinted pair and puts them on.
22) 8) dialog: Pittsburgh.
22) 10) dialog: (voice rising)
22) 13) dialog: (playfully)
22) 18) text: Young girls are supposed to dress up, go to school, play with boys, you know, that kinda stuff. Iris places a large gob of jam on her unbuttered toast an folds the bread over like a hotdog.
22) 19) dialog: God, you are square.
22) 21) text: At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy.  I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies. IRIS motions him to lower his voice.
22) 22) dialog: Who's a killer?
22) 24) dialog: He never killed nobody.  He's a Libra.
22) 26) dialog: I'm a Libra too.  That's why we get along so well.
22) 28) dialog: I think Cancer's make the best lovers.  My whole family are air signs.
22) 30) dialog: What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror.  You don't get eyes like that from...
22) 34) dialog: Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think.  Before that it was fantastic.  I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore.  Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know?  It was unbelievable.  Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane--that's my group, man. All Libras.  But now everybody's split or got sick or busted.  I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went.  I stayed here.
22) 36) dialog: Why don't you come to a commune with me?
22) 38) dialog: Why not?
22) 41) dialog: You a scorpion?  That's it.  You're a scorpion.  I can tell.
22) 45) dialog: Why?
22) 47) dialog: What's so important?
22) 49) dialog: You a narc?
22) 51) dialog: Yeah. TRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS jo his laughter.
22) 52) dialog: God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
22) 55) dialog: Just leave'em.  There's plenty of other girls.
22) 57) dialog: (astonished)
22) 60) dialog: Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
22) 64) dialog: How?
22) 68) dialog: (taken back)
22) 71) text: I'm sorry, Iris.  I didn't mean that.
22) 72) dialog: You're not much with girls, are you?
22) 74) text: Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful.  And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out.  And they hate it.  So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all.  So I don't say a thing.  I pretend I'm not even there.  I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it. It takes IRIS a moment to digest this pure example of negative thinking: I am loved to the extent I do not exis
22) 75) dialog: Do you really think I should go to the commune?
22) 79) dialog: Sure you don't want to come with me?
22) 81) dialog: I sure hate to go alone...
22) 83) dialog: You don't have to.
22) 86) dialog: What do you mean? CLOSE on C.U. of TRAVIS:
22) 93) dialog: It's my stomach.  I got the flu. Sport puts his hand on her hips.  He is slowly, carefully smoothly manipulating her.  It's the stone black hustle.
22) 95) dialog: Honest, Sport. Sport puts some slow soul music on the stereo.
24) 0) text: TRAVIS, his shirt fastened, stands beside table. C.U.: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table. read it. Dear Iris,
24) 51) dialog: Don't kill him, Travis!  Don't kill him! TRAVIS fires the revolver, blowing the back of THE OLD MA head off the silencing his protests. The police SIRENS screech to a halt.  SOUND of police officers running up the stairs.
