Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for  communications. A couple for research. People are at thei posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urg This is a place under siege. ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog.  He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. He toward the boss's little office at the back -- TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Squar jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the a Work on the desk. Cot in the corner.

23) 4) dialog: You're asking me a direct question?
23) 6) dialog: I thought you were never going to do  that.
23) 9) dialog: You'd want to make that go away.  You'd want to remind them that  Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical. You'd  want to sign off on that.
23) 11) dialog: Then I'd have to explain Treadstone.  And you'd have to explain how you  let me get this far. (silence) Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B,  does it? (Abbott staring) We'll clean up the field. You clean  up your budgets.

78) 6) dialog: We're exploring every possibility. (tighter by the moment) We are in pursuit. How much more do  you want me to tell you?
78) 8) dialog: No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly  where he is.
78) 10) text: CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.
78) 11) dialog: We've been down here for two weeks  banging our heads against the wall.  We've been sleeping down here. We  just got our first lead fourteen  hours ago, and now? -- now that we  finally have something to work with --  you want to bring planning personnel  down here? (real steam) I'd rethink that.
78) 13) dialog: This is an operations desk.
89) 9) dialog: Is that a medical term?
89) 15) dialog: This unit has an unblemished record  of success.
91) 0) text: ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, they can't. Too many people passing by --
91) 1) dialog: That was two hours -- two hours to  get a second opinion -- and nothing  changes. He's loose. He's out of  control. It's very clear what needs  to happen. (point blank) I have work to do.
91) 3) dialog: Turn? To who? Where does he turn?  What does he have to offer? He's got  nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece  of equipment for crissake. Where's  he gonna turn?

99) 7) dialog: Our last sighting was forty-eight  hours ago. Even if they stayed in  the car, the grid is huge. (please) This is it. He's trained --  conditioned -- they're built to  disappear. You give him another day  to run and we may never find him.

116) 4) dialog: -- that's what they're trained for --  just a surgical strike.
116) 6) dialog: What do you want to do?
116) 8) dialog: We're in the shitter, man! Pick your  poison. Maybe he's in there to finish  the job. Maybe he's working for  Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV  together. Every possibility sucks --  we've got to move!
118) 0) text: CONKLIN on his feet -- ABBOTT beet red -- this is getting loud --
118) 1) dialog: You don't have the stones for this.  You people come down here and wink  and whisper and we send these guys  out and get it done. And you're clear.  And the guys upstairs get what they  want. And the whole bunch of you are  so stuffed on deniability it's coming  out of your ears. (gauntlet) Well, you know what? You're here  now.

147) 2) text: CONKLIN wheels around. There he is. Right behind him.
147) 3) dialog: What did I do? What've you done? Do  you have any idea? Any conception?  What you've destroyed? Do you have  any idea how much time and work --  how many people have their lives  wrapped up in this?
147) 6) dialog: Am I Treadstone? Me? (peering at him closely  now --) What the hell're you talking about?
147) 9) dialog: What did I do? I spent thirty million  dollars on you. I spent three years  finding you -- four years training  you -- (incredulous) What did I do? (staring now) What in the name of God have you  been doing, Jason?
147) 11) dialog: They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried. (on it now) You really don't know what's going  on, do you?
147) 13) dialog: Of course. We had to try. We didn't  know what was wrong. (warming to this --) We didn't know you were in trouble.

147) 21) dialog: There never was a Jason Bourne. (that gets him) You have to come with me. It's the  only way. We can give it back to  you...
147) 23) dialog: Jason... (trying to follow --) They can't let you go...
