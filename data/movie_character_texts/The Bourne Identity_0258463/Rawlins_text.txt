103) 0) text: Meet RAWLINS. He's a young, jolly Brit -- pink and overfe and quite shocked to see...
103) 1) dialog: Mr. Kane... (hastily tidying up) Come right in... please... have a  seat.
103) 4) dialog: Well... (really thrown) I must admit, when my assistant told  me you were here I was, really -- I  was quite -- I was surprised.
103) 6) dialog: We thought you were gone for good.
103) 8) dialog: Well, I mean it's a tough business,  isn't it? Cutthroat.
103) 10) dialog: (finally) Look, our bid -- it was competitive --  but definitely at the high end of  competitive -- when we didn't hear  back from you, we did some re-analysis  of the numbers, and honestly, we'd  really like a chance to do a bit  better. (pitching now) I'm assuming you're still in the  market. It's the same vessel?
103) 12) dialog: We just picked up a job quite like  the one we were bidding for you.  Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy-  five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think  we learned a few things that might  allow us to make our proposal for  your job, as I said, a bit more  competitive.
103) 14) text: Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...
103) 15) dialog: Was it the break-in?
103) 17) dialog: We also thought we hadn't heard from  you -- we've had a bit of a publicity  nightmare, people have been talking. (the meat) Our offices were broken into --  vandalism mostly -- shortly after we  last spoke.
103) 19) text: RAWLINS smiles. Reset. Sales mode.
103) 20) dialog: Let me get you a new copy of the  proposal.
