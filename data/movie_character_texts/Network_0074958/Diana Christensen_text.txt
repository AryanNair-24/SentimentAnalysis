0) 10) dialog: (on phone) Let's start looking around for possible replacements. I hear ABC's grooming a mad prophet of their own in Chicago as our com- petition for next season. See if you can get a tape on him. Maybe we can steal him. And let's start building up the other segments on the show. Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing. The Vox Populi’ seg- ment is catching on; let's make that a daily feature -- INT. THE LIVING kOOM 159. MAX sprawled on the soft chair. We notice that, in the back of the living room, a bridge table has been set up as a makeshift desk. It has a typewriter on it and a welter of papers and books and filing folders. DIANA appears in the bedroom doorway, regards MAX coldly --

0) 21) dialog: (small voice) I don't know how to do that. Then, shatteringly, the PHONE o.s. in the bedroom RINGS; and DIANA promptly turns to answer it -- 160.

We don't want faith-healers, tentshow evangelists or Oberammargau passion- players! Whatabout that terrific new messiah ABC was supposed to have signed up as our competition?

0) 46) dialog: I think the time has come, Max, to re-evaluate our relationship.
0) 48) dialog: I don't like the way this script of ours is turning out. This whole thing started out as a comedy, remember? Now, it's turning into a seedy little drama. Middle-aged man leaves wife and family for young heartless woman, goes to pot. The Blue Angel with Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings. I don't like it.
0) 51) dialog: Right.
0) 53) dialog: The simple fact is you're a family man, Max. You like a home and kids, and that's beautiful. But I'm incapable of any such commitment. All you'll get from me is another couple of months of intermittent sex and recriminate and ugly little scenes like the one we had last night. I'm sorry for all those vicious things I said to you last night. You're not the worst fuck I've ever had. . Believe me, I've had worse. And you don't puff and snorkle and make death-like rattles. As a matter of fact, you're rather serene in the sack. MAX, who had gone into the bathroom for his toilet articles, comes out with them, stands, regards DIANA.

She fetches a cup and saucer from the cupboard and would make some instant coffee but she is overtaken by a curious little spasm. Her hand holding the cup and saucer is shaking so much she has to put them down. With visible effort, she pulls herself together. She moves out of the kitchen to the -- INT: THE LIVING ROOM 168. -- where she stands in the middle of the room and shouts at MAX through the opened bedroom doorway.

He disappears down the foyer. We can hear the CLICK of the front door being opened and the CLACK of the door closing. DIANA sits in her chair, pulling the shower robe around her, alone in her arctic desolation. INT: 20TH FLOOR - UBS BUILDING - LOBBY, 169. LOUNGE, CORRIDOR - 10:15 P.M. A solemn FRANK HACKETT in blue suit walks down the long, empty, hushed corridor to the large double doors of his office (which had originally been EDWARD RUDDY's office). At the doors, NELSON CHANEY is waiting for him.

Mr. Jensen said he did not like volatile industries and suggested with a certain sinister silkiness that volatility in business usually reflected bad management. He didn't really care if Howard Beale was the number one show in television or the fiftieth. He didn't really care if the Beale Show lost money. The network should be stabilized so that it can carry a losing show and still maintain an overall profit. Mr. Jensen has an important message he wants conveyed to the American people, and Howard Beale is conveying it. He wants Howard Beale on the air, and he wants him kept on. I would describe his position on this as inflexible. Where does that put us, Diana?
0) 78) dialog: (taking papers out of her attache case) That puts us in the shithouse, that's where that puts us. (holds up her sheaf of papers) . Do you want me to go through this?
0) 80) dialog: I have an advance TVQ report here. The Beale show Q score, which was forty-seven in the May book, is down to thirty-three and falling. Most of this loss occurred in the child and teen and eighteen-thirty-four categories, which were our core markets. NBC Nightly News, by contrast, has gone up to a twenty- nine Q, and, at this rate, will pass us by the end of July. Every- body here knows the Neilsen and share-trend scores. Let me just capsulate our own AR demographic reports which have been extensive. It is the AR department's carefully considered judgment -- and mine -- that if we get rid of Beale, we (MORE)
0) 85) text: 143 DIANA (Contd) should be able to maintain a very respectable share in the high twenties, possibly thirty, with a comparable Q level. The other segments on the Beale show -~- Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing, the Vox Populi -- have all developed their own audiences. Our AR reports show without exception that it is Howard Beale that's the destructive force here. Minimally, we are talking about a ten point differential in shares. I think Joe ought to spell it out for us. Joe?

An embroidery of red bullet holes perforate HOWARD's shirt and jacket, and we might even see the impact of a head wound as he pitches backwards dead. . A BANK OF FOUR COLOR TELEVISION MONITORS 182.
