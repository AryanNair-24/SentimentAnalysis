MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated be alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfri The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic poi (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken with the last one.  The relationship always competes with job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatenin burn all these old phone numbers.)
