3) 18) dialog: And banks became attentive. But just in case you think nothing ever happened to me.... 4.
4) 6) dialog: Just like that.
4) 9) dialog: I was kind of under the impression you cared a little more than just--
4) 13) dialog: Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to Mark on Friday. If you could just wait, see what he says-
4) 17) dialog: And it's all shit to you now?
4) 22) dialog: Then you know I could use a friend.
4) 33) dialog: Well -- what'll work, then?
4) 38) dialog: Not with that enthusiastic invite--
4) 45) dialog: Lindy. I really thought I had it in me to do something. --I wasn't getting around it, but it was fucking there. And now, I, ah... don't think it is. There. --Anything. At all.
4) 50) dialog: If, what?
4) 62) dialog: I never think about Melissa--!
6) 5) dialog: --Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't tell me what happened yesterday.
6) 10) dialog: You got it--?!
6) 14) dialog: 
7) 13) dialog: But who's counting.
7) 28) dialog: Sedentary job, you know...
7) 32) dialog: As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract.
7) 35) dialog: How about you?
7) 42) dialog: No.
7) 46) dialog: Nah, I should go--
7) 50) dialog: 
7) 63) dialog: It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern.
7) 67) dialog: 
8) 3) dialog: So... how's Melissa?
8) 7) dialog: I'm making conversation, Vern.
10) 2) dialog: How don't you know? You're her brother.
10) 7) dialog: A couple of kids...
12) 2) dialog: Who's the husband?
12) 6) dialog: It's just a question, Vern.
12) 11) dialog: Is that what she said--?! "A coke thing."
12) 16) dialog: (considering the question) How's it going... Well... I'm behind. I'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know.
12) 21) dialog: Not one fucking word, Vern.
12) 36) dialog: Oh, no-- no, no, no-
12) 40) dialog: You're still dealing.
12) 45) dialog: You mean a lab in some little Yalie's basement? Give me a--
12) 50) dialog: Okay, what is it?
12) 53) dialog: What's in it?
12) 65) dialog: I'm too old for this, Vernon.
12) 69) dialog: Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good? I smoke too much: my chest is sore. A fucking corpse has more energy than I do, I've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. One of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and I'll keel over dead. My life's in the crapper, and I DON'T think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if I do some brand new, shiny designer DRUG!
12) 91) dialog: I don't want it, Vern.
20) 9) dialog: Tuesday.
20) 13) dialog: Just tell him-
20) 47) dialog: What's wrong?
20) 53) dialog: "I was blind but now I see."
20) 63) dialog: You don't like me, and I don't blame you -- you see a schlumpy energy- sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband. You're hoping I'll blow my brains out. But my existence shouldn't make you this upset. What is it?
20) 68) dialog: Something wrong at school?
20) 73) dialog: People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange.
20) 77) dialog: I just saw the book--
20) 82) dialog: I've seen it before.
22) 10) dialog: If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use.
22) 14) dialog: Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor.
27) 5) dialog: No.
27) 10) dialog: Yes.
27) 15) dialog: Three pages. That's all you have to read. If you read them in the next hour, and you don't want to keep reading I'll give back the advance.
31) 11) dialog: Vern! It's Eddie.
31) 15) dialog: Vern -- last night 90 pages just wrote themselves! I totally chucked the novel I pitched them --I suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole societal economic class struggle -- and its solution -- didn't have to be futuristic or fictional -- it was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in our lifetime -- and I could just lay it out, like, like a manifesto, or something, like Mein Kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck! (no response, realizing) Okay, I won't talk any more about this if you let me in.
32) 5) dialog: 
32) 18) dialog: Yeah. That stuff's amazing.
32) 23) dialog: 
32) 29) dialog: What's... um... what's it called?
32) 33) dialog: "The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved.
32) 42) dialog: Yes. Definitely.
32) 52) dialog: Uh... sure.
36) 7) dialog: 
37) 3) dialog: Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't.
39) 3) dialog: At least you got your last meal.
39) 6) dialog: You never did like to cook...
39) 28) dialog: Heyheyhey! I'm the one that called you!
40) 3) dialog: ... No, ex-wife's brother. I just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to, you know...
40) 8) dialog: Wha-- No! Talk! What're you --
40) 12) dialog: He was -- I don't know, I heard he was sort of an antiques dealer.
40) 17) dialog: Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind of... chairs... sort of curlicue leg kind of things--
42) 3) dialog: Melissa?
42) 9) dialog: Right before. I'd just run into him on the street.
42) 14) dialog: Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with-
42) 18) dialog: Not on this line, no.
42) 21) dialog: Melissa... maybe... (a deep breath)
42) 27) dialog: Do you want to... meet somewhere, or...?
42) 32) dialog: Then... I'll see you at the funeral.
42) 36) dialog: Okay.
51) 3) dialog: ...enabled me to finish the book in four days.
55) 10) dialog: Learned to read music in a week...
58) 18) dialog: Which means a prosaic author's work rests on a foundation of acclaim-
58) 23) dialog: So you're saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement, that the greatest hits CD cannot possibly contain good songs? That Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?
58) 29) dialog: Well, then I'd guess you'd rather not hear about what I, personally, think could launch a thousand ships?
61) 3) dialog: ...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock -- (realizing they're lost) Okay, remember when I explained default flops? Did any of that stick?
62) 3) dialog: --Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years?
62) 13) dialog: Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature.
62) 16) dialog: We're wired to overreach -- you look at history, I mean, all the countries that ruled the world? Portugal? With its big, butch navy? All that's left is salt cod and cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they just sit on their dank little island, fussing over their suits. Nobody stops and thinks, hey, we're doing pretty well, we've got Poland and France, and a big Swiss bank account -- let's not invade Russia in the winter! Let's go home and pop a beer and live off the interest!
62) 22) dialog: Hey, I want in on it!
63) 11) dialog: Thank you so much.
65) 6) dialog: I'd like to re-negotiate my advance.
65) 27) dialog: 
65) 35) dialog: Yes, but I now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else.
65) 38) dialog: No, I mean it, look at the life. Incarceration, loneliness, burrowing down into your own psyche, increasingly insulated from any truth, because you're not in the currents of the world any more, you're rattling around inside the cage of your brain, self- cannibalizing...
65) 50) dialog: Oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop-dee-doo, you're "developing a readership," -- for what? So you can end up in Phoenix on a Saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten? --Half of them there for the wine and cheese?
65) 55) dialog: 
68) 3) dialog: Armed with Vern's last 800 dollars, I made 4000 in a day.
69) 3) dialog: Why not?
69) 8) dialog: Because I quintupled my money four days in a row.
69) 13) dialog: It's not luck.
69) 23) dialog: You think?
69) 28) dialog: And that's a problem for you because--?
69) 33) dialog: I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened.
71) 20) dialog: But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week.
72) 13) dialog: 
75) 5) dialog: Apparently he does.
75) 14) dialog: Self-improvement month. Someone gave me a wake-up call.
75) 25) dialog: Why? It stuck, didn't it?
75) 30) dialog: Who says I didn't? So what -- it's not getting over? Is that it?
75) 35) dialog: Begging for what.
75) 39) dialog: Gosh. This is so unexpected.
79) 5) dialog: Nothing.
79) 10) dialog: No.
79) 16) dialog: With success comes enemies.
79) 25) dialog: No proverb. An inevitability.
80) 14) dialog: I'm eating, Kevin.
80) 20) dialog: Have a toast point.
80) 35) dialog: Medication. I'm on special medication.
80) 42) dialog: --Yes, that's partially what I'm
80) 49) dialog: 
80) 53) dialog: Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone. We entered the age of decentralized, online decision- making, with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world, people who don't even know each other -- making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze.
80) 57) dialog: Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works.
80) 71) dialog: Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
80) 76) dialog: I don't have delusions of grandeur.
80) 79) dialog: I have an actual recipe for grandeur.
84) 3) dialog: But these companies aren't the question, are they?
84) 7) dialog: Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits?
84) 10) dialog: --Unless you wanted to play both sides of the fence, control the whole energy enchilada. But these wouldn't get you there in emerging markets. You'd need...
84) 20) dialog: Whoa, whoa. This must be some big- ass merger you're contemplating.
84) 23) dialog: And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon Associates...
84) 27) dialog: Carl, it's just rationalization.
84) 31) dialog: Is Hank Atwood going to go for it?
84) 36) dialog: Come on -- the two of you together? The world would have to come to you begging for energy like Oliver Twist with his little bowl of gruel.
84) 41) dialog: It doesn't matter. It won't come off.
84) 53) dialog: You'd have to back off Libya.
84) 58) dialog: I don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home.
84) 62) dialog: Ooh. Now you're curious.
84) 66) dialog: 
84) 75) dialog: I'm at your disposal.
84) 86) dialog: The Spartans weren't big on amenities.
96) 13) dialog: I can't make the meeting, I'm, uh... I'm sick.
96) 18) dialog: I need to, ah, analyze this data-
96) 26) dialog: Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now!
96) 31) dialog: Okay, Kevin. Okay.
98) 5) dialog: Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado...
98) 11) dialog: What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood.
98) 21) dialog: Nowhere.
98) 26) dialog: Yeah, his Great Leap Forward.
98) 52) dialog: Excuse me.
100) 17) dialog: Melissa--?
100) 21) dialog: Melissa, I want to talk to you. Please. Meet me somewhere...
100) 25) dialog: Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the street. At two.
100) 29) dialog: Please. Melissa -- it's important, please come -- you have to tell me what you're talking about!
103) 3) dialog: Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan, please?
103) 8) dialog: I'm a journalist. From Electronics Today magazine.
103) 13) dialog: I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye.
103) 18) dialog: I, ah, may I speak to Jerry Brady?
103) 22) dialog: Uh-- Bill Johnson.
103) 34) dialog: Oh my God. What's wrong with him?
104) 19) dialog: 
105) 11) dialog: Melissa...?
105) 22) dialog: You... how are you doing?
105) 28) dialog: I guess I lost some weight...
105) 36) dialog: Since when do you read the Post?
105) 40) dialog: Melissa, what do you mean?
105) 44) dialog: No.
105) 55) dialog: Why?
105) 59) dialog: And...?
105) 65) dialog: A lot.
105) 72) dialog: Yeah.
105) 81) dialog: Finish your story.
106) 6) dialog: But when I run out--
106) 11) dialog: Who invented MDT?
106) 21) dialog: 
106) 38) dialog: I... I... ahh...
106) 42) dialog: I'm here now!
107) 3) dialog: I'll get you a check.
107) 9) dialog: Gennady, look-
107) 13) dialog: I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF!
107) 23) dialog: 
107) 27) dialog: It's aspirin.
108) 3) dialog: That's the whole thing, plus twenty.
108) 8) dialog: Aspirin and vitamins.
110) 12) dialog: I'm sorry -- I'm sick. I wasn't going to make it home-
110) 17) dialog: IT WON'T HELP--! I need to get-- it's very simple: I need my pills.
110) 28) dialog: They're... for my headaches...
110) 32) dialog: It's... complicated.
110) 36) dialog: Not... the way you...
110) 40) dialog: No. That won't--
110) 43) dialog: Hello?
111) 5) dialog: W-what?
112) 4) dialog: It was supposed to be legal.
112) 8) dialog: I have a supply... stashed...
112) 12) dialog: I just need... to get it...
114) 2) dialog: Not to my apartment. I moved it.
114) 6) dialog: I was smart. I was on MDT.
117) 3) dialog: Hi -- Have you got it?
117) 12) dialog: Are you sure?
117) 21) dialog: Don't get out.
117) 25) dialog: Call the cops.
117) 33) dialog: 
120) 2) dialog: Yes. What's happening?
120) 6) dialog: Just be still, stop talking.
120) 10) dialog: What?
120) 14) dialog: Listen to me. Can he see you?
120) 25) dialog: Can he see you?!
120) 29) dialog: There is something.
120) 33) dialog: Listen to me. Reach into the bag and take one of the pills.
120) 37) dialog: Yes.
120) 40) dialog: You will know what do to, Lindy. Take one, and you'll know.
120) 44) dialog: You'll come on in thirty seconds. And yes, you will think your way out, that's what it does. Are you taking it--?
120) 50) dialog: Lindy. I love you.
125) 3) dialog: We'll stay here for a couple of days. We'll be powered up, we'll be able to think our way out of this...
125) 6) dialog: I'm back. All right?
125) 11) dialog: I can take care of you now.
125) 15) dialog: A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you.
127) 3) dialog: Looking for me?
127) 15) dialog: I was under the impression that our business was settled.
127) 21) dialog: So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman.
127) 25) dialog: What shit.
127) 30) dialog: Well, so do I. You took the last one.
127) 34) dialog: I can't get more -- the dealer's dead.
127) 45) dialog: Nothing. I. Can. Do.
127) 49) dialog: A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on--
127) 54) dialog: I might... be able to get ten.
127) 58) dialog: (holding his ground) Ten. And no guarantee there's more.
129) 4) dialog: I was sick. I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. I tried to cancel, but Kevin imploded on me--
129) 9) dialog: A hundred and five, is what you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.
129) 13) dialog: I sent over my revised projections--
129) 17) dialog: I know, but I think if you look at
129) 25) dialog: I'm sorry.
133) 3) dialog: Is it possible to construct an... imperceptible compartment?
133) 7) dialog: Quite large.
133) 17) dialog: I would never again stash my MDT, not in an apartment, not in Fort Knox.
134) 3) dialog: I don't want it known that I have any security. You won't precede me, you'll follow me, never less than ten steps behind... `inconspicuous' doesn't begin to describe you. You're not there. You're a CEO'S wife -- you're wallpaper.
136) 5) dialog: Can you make more?
136) 17) dialog: Meaning...?
136) 21) dialog: That's too long.
136) 27) dialog: Two million dollars if you do it in six.
136) 37) dialog: I thought we straightened this out, Detective.
136) 48) dialog: What is it about?
137) 8) dialog: I don't remember.
138) 5) dialog: ...well, a unified front between Van Loon and Atwood would be lethally effective, and not a moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out...
138) 9) dialog: Well, the governmental bribe structure is, in itself, corrupt, so of course information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought. And there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates. I have a list here, in descending order of threat...
139) 5) dialog: It flew. Of course, he's not going to tell you right now...
139) 15) dialog: Might be an act.
139) 22) dialog: When this is over?
139) 28) dialog: All right. If all this comes off... what's my take?
139) 32) dialog: I trust you.
139) 37) dialog: Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. Let's say forty- five.
140) 11) dialog: What is the asking price?
142) 11) dialog: Next week? You can fuck yourself.
143) 21) dialog: Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't.
143) 27) dialog: 
145) 3) dialog: I realize that this is a useless platitude, but... if there's anything we can do...
145) 13) dialog: Cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney?
147) 16) dialog: Why?
147) 21) dialog: Of course.
152) 8) dialog: Not a word, Carl.
152) 20) dialog: Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement.
152) 24) dialog: A coma?
160) 33) dialog: I'm plum out.
162) 9) dialog: 
172) 4) dialog: I'm sure you're curious about what's happened to your boss. I certainly am. If my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, to save his life, then why is he dead? At what point was the Pony Express supposed to ride in with the life- saving medication?
176) 8) dialog: I have a lunch.
176) 13) dialog: Who's that?
176) 18) dialog: Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research?
177) 5) dialog: Nice to see you.
177) 8) dialog: We appreciate everything you've done for us--
177) 19) dialog: Maintain?
177) 24) dialog: What are you saying?
177) 34) dialog: Have you been watching me from the beginning?
177) 38) dialog: Who's "us?"
177) 43) dialog: How did it get on the street?
177) 51) dialog: And what about for you? Why don't you take it?
177) 61) dialog: And in return...? I do what.
177) 65) dialog: And later...? What will you be "bothering" me with?
177) 70) dialog: And if I don't like your ideas?
177) 77) dialog: Luckily I can do that myself.
177) 81) dialog: My lab?
177) 84) dialog: Which one?
177) 95) dialog: You sure?
177) 102) dialog: Tell me something.
177) 105) dialog: Did I kill that woman?
178) 22) dialog: After you.
178) 28) dialog: Please.
178) 35) dialog: Don't underestimate your own creation.
178) 38) dialog: I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks.
178) 44) dialog: You think I didn't spend my days on MDT devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the Israelis--? You think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? You think this conversation is private?
178) 48) dialog: You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours.
178) 52) dialog: Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it.
178) 55) dialog: What if I just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? I mean, isn't it like the 8-ball?
178) 58) dialog: It always answers.
