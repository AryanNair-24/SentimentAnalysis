14) 3) dialog: --Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--!
42) 16) dialog: No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more.
42) 34) dialog: No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay?
100) 19) dialog: (surprised he picked up) Eddie--?
100) 23) dialog: We're talking now.
100) 27) dialog: You can't see me, Eddie.
105) 25) dialog: Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way...
105) 30) dialog: Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you.
105) 33) dialog: I know you've been doing it. I just read the Post. Eddie. Short-selling stocks? Second-guessing the markets? You? Come on.
105) 38) dialog: These days, the Post's about all I can read.
105) 42) dialog: I mean, I did it too. And I only took nine or ten hits. Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
105) 47) dialog: Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug...
105) 53) dialog: I was like, down the hatch. And it was amazing. I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and understood it. My work rate increased... just, insanely, overnight. My boss started to hate me -- they offered me his job. And then I got scared.
105) 57) dialog: I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. I stopped taking it.
105) 61) dialog: I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day...
105) 67) dialog: Well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch...
105) 70) dialog: You're off it right now, aren't you?
105) 79) dialog: Are you getting a headache?
105) 83) dialog: Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here.
105) 86) dialog: That was two years ago, and I haven't been the same since. I can't read any more -- I mean, the fucking New York Post?
105) 89) dialog: After this, I'm going to have a migraine for three days. And I've got to pee. Which is another thing.
106) 3) dialog: You have some left? Good. Go home and take it. Take the dose down, but don't just stop -- you'll die if you just stop. Try to taper off. Otherwise, the headache's just the beginning... I have to go--
106) 8) dialog: I don't know. I have to go--
106) 13) dialog: I don't know--
