80) 29) dialog: So. Eddie Morgan.
81) 5) dialog: My daughter went there. I'll call the school for you.
82) 10) dialog: I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what your game is, but I'm sure of one thing: you don't work in this business. I'm up to my ass in investment guys, and you don't have their half-cocky, half-terrified line of bullshit. Which is not to say I like yours any better.
84) 5) dialog: What do you mean?
84) 25) dialog: Have you been talking to somebody-?
84) 34) dialog: You are either an amazing con artist or a very smart young man.
84) 39) dialog: You realize that if the press got one whisper of -- I can't fucking believe I'm even discussing this--
84) 51) dialog: The word "brazen" does not even begin to go there.
84) 55) dialog: Why? He's come this far--
84) 60) dialog: You're a gusty little prick, Eddie.
84) 64) dialog: Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a couple pretty big buttons. Go on. Tell me what you think.
84) 70) dialog: All right. You get your shot. Come to my office, tomorrow at ten, and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re- structure this deal.
84) 78) dialog: You don't really live here...?
84) 88) dialog: Yeah. And they eventually got their asses kicked.
98) 3) dialog: What do you know about Hank Atwood?
98) 8) dialog: Uh-huh. So this is "prepared," Eddie?
98) 13) dialog: Where was he two years ago?
98) 24) dialog: Two years ago Forbes didn't even have him on the radar.
98) 29) dialog: The guy comes on, out of nowhere, so fucking strong he has me on the run. Beat me out of two properties, invests in bumfuck countries with no oil, places I wouldn't go near, sextuples his money.
98) 38) dialog: ...100 billion if he has a nickel... and I have to convince him, somehow, that I can raise his game.
98) 49) dialog: You can't tell me he's in this to improve the fucking planet. He owns a ball team.
129) 2) dialog: I won't deny you pissed me off, Eddie.
129) 7) dialog: I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
129) 11) dialog: Look, there can't be any instability. Not when you're playing at this level.
129) 15) dialog: I didn't ask for your projections.
129) 20) dialog: I already have.
129) 27) dialog: ...some things my team missed. So, oddly enough, I find myself... needing to fill a position.
139) 3) dialog: Eddie...? What's your read.
139) 13) dialog: Jesus. He seems frail.
139) 17) dialog: Yeah, doesn't track. He's not even 60.
139) 26) dialog: You haven't asked the question.
139) 30) dialog: You should have pre-negotiated.
139) 34) dialog: You shouldn't.
139) 39) dialog: Done. Forty five thousand dollars.
139) 47) dialog: Forty million's plenty, Eddie. There's plenty more where this came from.
139) 50) dialog: ...But you're not going to continue working for me, are you?
139) 53) dialog: Don't lie. You're already bored. Onto the next...?
143) 7) dialog: There was all last night to tell us that.
143) 32) dialog: Pull it back, Pierce.
143) 36) dialog: 
143) 43) dialog: Pierce, you can stay.
145) 5) dialog: Obviously we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible.
145) 10) dialog: 
145) 23) dialog: Well. He'd better get better.
152) 6) dialog: Have you been talking to anyone?
152) 10) dialog: Where have you been, Eddie--? This is the second time you've turned to
152) 22) dialog: No. Atwood's in a coma.
154) 3) dialog: Eddie--? This came for you.
155) 3) dialog: What are you doing, Eddie--?
