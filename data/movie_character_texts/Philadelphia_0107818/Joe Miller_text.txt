They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?

Zero. Get the picture, Filko? Discrimination! You find yourself a female, paraplegic, legal assistant who is qualified to work here, except she can't take a leak... and you've got yourself a sex discrimination suit and a handicapped discrimination suit.

And he has a cane at side, which he'll use throughout the trial.
0) 859) dialog: It's up to you, to sift through layer and layer of truth, and determine for yourselves the version that sounds the most true.
0) 861) dialog: There are certain points in our version, that I must prove to you... Point number one: Andrew Beckett was... is a brilliant lawyer. A great lawyer. Point number two. Andrew Beckett, afflicted with a debilitating disease, made the legal, understandable, personal choice to keep the fact of his illness to himself... Point number three: His employers discovered his illness. And ladies and gentlemen, the illness I'm referring to, is AIDS...
0) 862) text: Joe pauses, letting that sink in.
0) 863) dialog: Point number four. They panicked. And, in their panic, they did what most of us would like to do with AIDS... Get it, and the people who have it, as far away from us as possible.
0) 864) text: Joe walks away from Andrew.
0) 865) dialog: The behavior of Andrew Beckett's employers may seem reasonable to you. It does to me. After all, AIDS is a deadly, incurable, disease...
0) 867) dialog: But however you come to judge the behavior of Charles Wheeler and his partners in moral, ethical, human terms... When they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, they broke the law.
0) 868) text: With a swift, direct glance at the Judge, Joe speaks with considerable power and emotion:
0) 869) dialog: And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.

0) 895) dialog: According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
0) 897) text: Joe takes on a street-tough tone:

0) 900) dialog: Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
0) 902) text: Joe STARES at the guy.
0) 903) dialog: It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
0) 905) dialog: Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.

So, let's get it out in the open. Let's talk about what this case is really about: the general public's hatred... our loathing, our fear of homosexuals.
