3) 24) text: A.J., did you get one of these? This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a separate entrance on the left side of the room. In additi to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advis he's the President's closest and oldest friend.
3) 25) dialog: Is that the letter from Solomon at the GDC?
3) 27) dialog: I think they're just frustrated, Mr. President.
3) 29) dialog: Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean. (continuing; to SHEPHERD)
3) 32) dialog: It won't pass at 20 percent.
3) 34) dialog: Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers. If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year.
3) 36) dialog: (to an AIDE)
3) 37) text: Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him the President's-- A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on pedestrian collision in the outer office--
3) 40) dialog: (to the AIDE)
3) 41) text: Never mind. LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the Presiden Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very cl over the past few years.
3) 45) dialog: We're all here, Mr. President.
3) 50) dialog: Crime control, Robin. Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime.
3) 52) dialog: Lewis--
3) 54) dialog: We're leaving 'em out.
3) 59) dialog: Robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. As of today, the crime bill's priority one on the President's domestic agenda.
3) 61) dialog: Leon, you're gonna run the war room. We're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week. And, Leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do what the N.R.A. does.
3) 63) dialog: Yeah.
3) 65) dialog: Lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this. You're gonna run the show on the hill.
3) 69) dialog: We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today. The last nose count put us 18 votes short.
3) 71) dialog: Thank you, Mr. President. The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Th you, Mr. President"'s as they exit.

10) 4) dialog: Any security concerns?
10) 14) dialog: Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun at the GDC.
10) 16) dialog: She's a lawyer from Virginia named Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman well. She's had a lot of success getting congressmen elected.
10) 18) dialog: You know, if you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello. It might smooth the way.
10) 20) dialog: Good.
10) 22) dialog: We will, Mr. President. SHEPHERD
10) 23) text: Good. A.J. starts to leave. SHEPHERD stops him.
10) 25) dialog: 
10) 26) dialog: Yes?
10) 29) dialog: Good night, Mr. President.
10) 31) dialog: I beg your pardon?
10) 33) dialog: (laughing off the suggestion)
10) 35) dialog: (continuing)
14) 15) dialog: Your concerns are not falling on deaf ears. The environmental lobby has known no greater alley in the White House than President Shepherd.
14) 24) dialog: (pause)
14) 26) dialog: (continuing)
14) 29) dialog: Yes, he is.
14) 34) dialog: Good morning, Mr. President. How are you today?
14) 36) text: I apologize for the interruption, but A.J. asked me to stop and say hello. You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by any chance, would you?
14) 44) text: Of course. SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J. office and into the hallway.
16) 0) text: SHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second flo residence. His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool something he does almost as well as being President. A.J. stands to the side with his pool cue.
16) 1) dialog: McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know we're making our move on the crime bill. They're circling the wagons on the assault weapons.
16) 3) dialog: Let Lewis take a pass at them first.
16) 5) dialog: Nice shot, Mr. President.
16) 7) dialog: I will not do it playing pool, I will not do it in a school, I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am.
16) 9) dialog: Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was thrilled with the deal you made this morning. SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.
16) 11) dialog: It's a waste of time.
16) 13) dialog: Also, Sydney Wade called. SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mi
16) 15) dialog: (beat)
16) 18) dialog: (beat)
16) 21) dialog: Did she say anything about you? 13 in the corner.
16) 24) dialog: (quietly)
16) 27) dialog: I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in the corner. He misses the shot.
16) 29) dialog: You're not serious.
16) 31) dialog: The President can't just go out on a date.
16) 33) dialog: You're not--
16) 35) dialog: Mr. President, this is an election year. If you're looking for female companionship, we can make arrangements that'll insure total privacy and--
16) 37) dialog: No, sir, this is the White House.
16) 39) dialog: The difference is he didn't have to be the president on television. You've said it a million times: If there were a television set in every living room 60 years ago, this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair.
16) 41) dialog: We'll take a hit.
16) 43) dialog: I don't know. Five points. Maybe more.
16) 45) dialog: It could be more.
16) 47) dialog: Do you want me to have Kodak put together some numbers so we know what we're talking about?
16) 50) dialog: Mr. President, the American people have a funny way of deciding on their own what is and what is not their business.
16) 53) dialog: (beat)
16) 56) text: Janie! (to A.J.)
16) 58) dialog: She said you're taller than she thought you'd be.
25) 4) text: We could do with a little party leadership, Mike. Is the Majority Whip takin' a break? Congress is in session, right, I'm not wrong about that? LISA, another intern, is hanging up a phone in the backgr and crossing to the corkboard.
30) 0) text: This formal reception area is filled with special GUESTS. SYDNEY walks in, A.J. goes to her immediately.
30) 1) dialog: Sydney, come on in. You look beautiful.
30) 3) dialog: I promise you there's no hidden agenda. SHEPHERD approaches SYDNEY.
30) 6) dialog: You know my wife, Esther.
30) 12) dialog: Sydney, when you meet the French President, don't make him feel too loved, all right? We just signed a new trade agreement.
32) 19) dialog: I'll bet no one accused Louis of being soft on crime.
32) 22) dialog: Bob Rumson would embrace it.
49) 0) text: SHEPHERD, A.J., the SECRETARY OF STATE, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, and about a dozen or so Pentagon, Security Counc and Joint Chiefs OFFICIALS are doing exactly what they're trained for.
49) 5) dialog: What's the estimate?
49) 20) dialog: 
49) 21) dialog: It's immediate, it's decisive, it's low risk, and it's a proportional response.
50) 0) text: SHEPHERD is with A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, KODAK and a couple o AIDES, all of whom look as though they've been called out their homes in the middle of the night.
50) 1) dialog: Robin, as soon as our planes have cleared Libyan airspace, you can call the press. I don't know when we'll have the full B.D.A.--
51) 0) text: SHEPHERD is at the podium taking questions. He's flanked his PENTAGON STAFF. A.J. and LEWIS stand to the side. ROB stands out of the way.
51) 4) dialog: (sotto to ROBIN)
59) 29) dialog: Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning, Ms. Wade. I see everyone's getting an early start today.
59) 36) dialog: Good for you, Lewis.
59) 42) dialog: Esther's over in my office. She's got the station wagon outside. SHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man plan ahead.
59) 51) dialog: (the meeting's over)
59) 52) text: Thank you, Mr. President. LEWIS, ROBIN and A.J. say their "Thank you, Mr. President on the way out ...
59) 53) dialog: (continuing)
72) 7) dialog: Mr. President. I just got off the phone with the Federal Mediator in St. Louis. Management just walked away from the table. The baggage handlers, pilots and flight attendants are getting set to walk in 48 hours.
72) 9) dialog: Don't have a airline strike at Christmas?
72) 11) dialog: You can leave straight from the fund- raiser. Janie, get him outta here.
86) 18) dialog: Hey, Sydney, Merry Christmas.
86) 20) dialog: Where you been?
86) 22) dialog: Syd, relax. It's Christmas. SHEPHERD joins them.
86) 26) dialog: What were you doing up on the Hill, anyway?
86) 30) dialog: (beat)
86) 34) dialog: You're in good company. I sat with 'em a week ago. They told me there was nothing on the President's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill.
86) 36) dialog: You're kidding, right? SYDNEY isn't aware she's said anything of particular consequence.
86) 38) dialog: Yeah...
86) 46) dialog: Did what I think just happened, just happen? Did the GDC's political director just tell the President and the White House Chief of Staff that there are three votes on the crime bill that can be bought by stickin' the fossil fuel package in a drawer.
86) 48) dialog: It doesn't change the facts, Mr. President. If Sydney gets her 24 votes and we're three short, there's some maneuvering to be done.
86) 50) dialog: You made a deal, Mr. President.
86) 52) dialog: You made it with the GDC.
86) 54) dialog: If your approval rating drops any more, things are gonna get tight.
92) 0) text: LEWIS and KODAK stand in front of A.J.'s desk.
92) 5) text: A.J., it's meaningless unless we ask him about Sydney.
92) 6) dialog: Fine. Do it.
97) 0) text: SHEPHERD stands in front A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK. JANIE is somewhere in the background.
97) 1) dialog: We lost Quincy, too.
97) 20) dialog: Mr. President--
97) 31) dialog: Mr. President, I think we have to do it.
97) 34) dialog: Lewis, shut up. There's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has lock eyes with LEWIS.
97) 41) dialog: All right, that's enough.
97) 43) dialog: The President doesn't answer to you, Lewis.
102) 1) dialog: Hartfort? What's in Hartford?
102) 5) dialog: Listen. I'm gonna have Janie clear your schedule for the weekend. You need to get some rest.
102) 7) dialog: No, sir.
102) 10) dialog: But I sure as hell will if you don't start gettin' your head outta your ass.
102) 12) dialog: Lewis is right. Go after this guy.
102) 14) dialog: What?
102) 16) dialog: Has he lied?
102) 18) dialog: And you think you're wrong?
102) 20) dialog: We fight the fights we can win.
102) 22) dialog: You fight the fights that need fighting!
102) 24) dialog: I beg your pardon.
102) 26) dialog: Because if I hadn't been, you'd be the most popular history professor at the University of Wisconsin.
102) 30) dialog: Yes, sir. SHEPHERD gets to the doorway...stops...turns around...
102) 32) dialog: Would we have won?
102) 34) dialog: I don't know. But I would've liked that campaign. If my friend Andy Shepherd had shown up, I would have liked that campaign. SHEPHERD looks away...nods absently...
102) 36) text: Yeah. SHEPHERD exits, leaving A.J. alone as we
105) 7) text: Lewis...call A.J. and come on down here...I don't know, but something's happening.
106) 0) text: A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President.
106) 1) dialog: Well, you don't see that every day of the week.
106) 3) dialog: Lewis, call the printer.
106) 5) dialog: Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new ball game. You've got 35 minutes.
107) 4) dialog: Where are you going?
107) 6) dialog: How're you gonna do that?
107) 8) dialog: You're just gonna drive over?
107) 12) dialog: It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If anybody needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen. A.J. exits.
109) 0) text: It's off the main corridor, and it's being used as a gree room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JA and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff links.
109) 22) dialog: Sounds right up your alley. SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and th pulls him into a strong embrace. A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--
109) 23) dialog: (continuing)
