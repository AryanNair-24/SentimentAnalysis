0) 22) dialog: That's a condition of your parole-
0) 24) dialog: That's contact! Conversation is contact! Especially with Chet Finch. He was on your crew, for God's sake.
0) 26) dialog: Exactly. I'm a cop.

And a makeshift case board, dedicated to his mother. Ther are old newspaper articles: HIT AND RUN KILLS MOTHER OF T And DIAGRAMS and PHOTOS of the corner in Queens where she killed. The ALARM CLICKS ON. It plays his favorite music, BOSSA NOVA. 5. Tony stirs. He opens a drawer in his nightstand, and remo his SERVICE REVOLVER, a Glock 19.

1) 5) dialog: When's your interview?
1) 9) dialog: I'm just saying. Gabby went to a lot of trouble-
1) 11) dialog: (embarrassed) Gabriel. Inspector Vasquez.
1) 13) dialog: I'm not involved with your P.O.
1) 15) dialog: Do you have a shirt?

1) 20) text: For Evan's little league game. They asked me to umpire. Four o'clock. And you're coming. (Big Tony winces) Dad. You're coming. You haven't been to a game all year.
1) 22) dialog: You don't have to say "lesbian wife". You can just say wife. During this, Tony starts to use a NAPKIN. Then he puts it back, and tears off a PAPER TOWEL instead.
1) 24) dialog: I'm good.
1) 26) dialog: That doesn't make it right. If you break one rule, they all break.
1) 28) dialog: You were married to her. But I listened to her. Big Tony collects the "stolen" napkins.
1) 30) text: Okay. You come with me. We'll go back to Wendys. We'll find the Manager. "Here are the ten napkins you've been looking for. I confess! It was me!" (waving a PACKET) Oh wait. Here's a Splenda from the I-Hop in Fairfield. I'11 mail it to them. During this, Tony's CELL PHONE RINGS.

1) 37) dialog: That's an infraction.
1) 45) dialog: Hey Cowboy. What are you doing?
1) 47) dialog: What if somebody saw you? They'd pull your badge.
1) 49) dialog: Here's a question. When you do finally retire, how will anyone know? 10.
2) 0) text: Tony & Loomis walk up a hill, toward the body. Loomis is of shape. He falls behind.
2) 3) dialog: (indicates Loomis) Well, we know HE didn't do it. (resuming, to Cheadle) Any I.D.?
2) 7) dialog: No. Let's wait for the good doctor.
2) 9) dialog: I'm guessing. Two days.
2) 11) dialog: Maybe. This isn't the primary. He was killed somewhere else. (examines the shoes) No scuff marks. He wasn't dragged, he was carried. Who found him? Nearby: the DIRT BIKERS are being questioned.
2) 13) dialog: Get a statement. Separately. Separate cars. And stay away from that bush.
2) 15) dialog: Yeah. Poison sumac.
2) 17) dialog: They parked down the hill. They carried him 35, maybe 40 yards. Why'd they leave him here, out in the open? Another ten feet they're in the woods.
2) 19) dialog: Maybe. (beat) Maybe they wanted him found. 12.
2) 52) dialog: All right. Let's meet our mystery guest. The bag is cut away, revealing a familiar face. It's Jack Livingston! The ex cop. Big Tony's nemesis. Everyone recognizes him. A stunned beat.
2) 57) dialog: Save your tears, Captain. Jack was dead to you, to all of you, the minute he agreed to testify.
2) 64) dialog: Iwill. I'll do it. He's coming to my kid's baseball game. (to Loomis) Can you cover the autopsy? I'll meet you back in the war room. Loomis nods. Tony starts for the door.
3) 5) dialog: 
3) 9) dialog: You're OUT! Out?!? A confused beat.
3) 11) dialog: You were out of the baseline. Sorry, buddy. The PARENTS BOO. The PLAYERS BOO. EVERYONE BOOS.

4) 2) dialog: Good hit though. Way to hustle.
4) 6) dialog: I get it. Very cute. Well, I think he learned a valuable lesson.
4) 8) dialog: I'll have to call you. An ex cop was killed, so it's all hands on deck.
4) 11) dialog: I was about to tell you. It was Jack Livingston. They found him this morning in Ambrose Park.
4) 13) dialog: It wasn't pretty. Abducted. Drugged. Suffocated. Then shot.
4) 15) dialog: Jesus! Dad!
4) 17) dialog: Where would you start?
4) 21) dialog: Are you gonna help me here or not?
4) 23) dialog: You believe them?
4) 25) dialog: I heard he was broke. I heard he owed the Newmark Brothers.
4) 27) dialog: Donna.
4) 30) dialog: My old man was right. Bookies, cops, ex cops, gangbangers. Half the borough had it in for this guy.
4) 32) dialog: I can't read it from here, Ryan.
4) 34) dialog: Ryan, Ryan, I just need the headlines. Time of death?
4) 36) dialog: That's a pretty big window.
4) 38) dialog: They jacked him up before they killed him.
4) 42) dialog: Five shots after he died. Cowboy? What do you think?
4) 44) dialog: He thinks we should look at the wife.
4) 55) dialog: Hey. Guys. We're on the job. Let's do the job. Ryan, check the phone records- his and hers. Make sure the DA's office is looped in. Cowboy, turn these guys over, check their alibis. We've gotta start clearing this board. Capt. Delgetty enters. She looks concerned.
4) 56) dialog: Captain?
4) 62) dialog: (reading list, baffled) It's me.
4) 68) dialog: There's been a mistake.
4) 71) dialog: (overruling his own counsel) That won't be necessary. I'll stipulate the shots came from my gun. I ran the test myself, twice.
4) 73) dialog: There's no need for that. We're all here for the same reason, right? We're trying to figure out what happened.
4) 80) dialog: Thank you, Phil.

5) 7) dialog: I don't know what happened.
5) 9) dialog: I know you have. 32.
5) 11) dialog: Why do you say that?
5) 13) dialog: Me too.
5) 15) dialog: Hello? Dad? No response.
5) 17) dialog: (into PHONE) No, he's not there. Well if he checks in, tell him to call me. Tell him it's important. Tony hangs up. He sighs. He considers the WALL OF FAMILY PHOTOS. He focuses on a photo of CONNIE, his late mother.

6) 13) dialog: Dad. We need to talk. Can we go someplace?
6) 15) dialog: I can't do it here. (then, giving in) Jack Livingston was killed with my gun.
6) 17) dialog: It's more that possible. It's a statement of fact.
6) 19) dialog: You can't ask around, Dad. They're looking at you.
6) 21) dialog: (pointedly) You threatened him. In public.
6) 23) dialog: You threatened him on multiple occasions. 35.
6) 26) dialog: I am the badge.
6) 28) dialog: Dad-
6) 30) dialog: Here's what I know. Livingston was shot sometime on Saturday with my gun- MY GUN- which was never out of my sight except while I slept. It's all about access, dad. The front door was locked. The back door was locked. The only people in the house were you and me.

7) 0) text: A block away. Tony & Big Tony are parked in TONY'S SEDAN. It's a father-son stakeout.

7) 7) dialog: I know what you were watching, Dad. I get the bill.

7) 40) dialog: What do you think?
7) 42) dialog: It's all we've got. It was my gun. Nothing else makes sense. 40.
7) 51) dialog: Murderers lie.

7) 103) dialog: It helps me think.
7) 105) dialog: What are you doing?! No don't- Gabby! (sighing, fixing his desk) Why do you torture me?

7) 108) dialog: How was your childhood?
7) 110) dialog: Outstanding, until my mother died. Whatever we needed, whatever we wanted, the old man took care of it. Diamond Tony Caruso. A house in Florida. A new car every year. Seats behind the dugout..

9) 20) dialog: (finally focusing) What's over?
9) 26) dialog: You can't smoke in here.

9) 55) dialog: I need someone to tell me if I'm crazy.
9) 57) dialog: Not me. The case. I think I know who shot Jack Livingston.
9) 59) dialog: I think it was me. I shot him, but I didn't know I shot him.

13) 28) dialog: Were you serious about taking the exam?
13) 30) dialog: Maybe we are. I could talk to the Captain. Suddenly they stop. The hood of Tony's car is open. The DISTRIBUTOR CAP has been ripped out. 62.
13) 33) dialog: You don't want to do this, Chet. You're not a murderer.
13) 40) dialog: (surprised, flattered) Really? 63. Now we reveal: Gabby really DOES have a gun! It's holster behind her, out of sight. She SLOWLY REACHES FOR IT, as..
