1) 23) dialog: What are you doing?
1) 24) dialog: I'm good.
1) 25) dialog: (indicates the NAPKINS) Why? Because they say "Wendys"? You are pathological, you know that? They're just napkins! Everybody takes them!

4) 17) dialog: Where would you start?
4) 18) dialog: If it was my case? I'd be looking at me. Tony gestures, "be serious". BIG TONY (CONT’D) Why not? Who has a better motive? I did 12 birthdays inside for that bastard. (grins) (MORE )
4) 20) dialog: Maybe I'm your blind spot. Every cop has one.
4) 21) dialog: Are you gonna help me here or not?
4) 22) dialog: Livingston took five other cops down with me. Every one of ‘em told me they'd take him out if they could.
4) 23) dialog: You believe them?

6) 11) dialog: It's something. It might be enough. I'll never stop looking, you know that.
6) 12) dialog: That sonofabitch better pray to God you find him before I do. Then, gingerly..
6) 13) dialog: Dad. We need to talk. Can we go someplace?
6) 14) dialog: We are someplace. What's going on?
6) 15) dialog: I can't do it here. (then, giving in) Jack Livingston was killed with my gun.

6) 26) dialog: I am the badge.
6) 27) dialog: Let's be very careful here, Anthony. Let's not say anything we're not gonna regret. I've had people tuned up-
6) 28) dialog: Dad-
6) 29) dialog: Maybe I tuned some people up myself. I don't deny that. But I never crossed the line. I never killed nobody. You know that.
6) 30) dialog: Here's what I know. Livingston was shot sometime on Saturday with my gun- MY GUN- which was never out of my sight except while I slept. It's all about access, dad. The front door was locked. The back door was locked. The only people in the house were you and me.

9) 29) dialog: Because I did it. I killed him.
9) 30) dialog: No you didn't.
9) 31) dialog: You're a good cop, Tony. But you're not a father. (heartfelt) I'd take a bullet for you. Don't you know that? (clarifying) Not in the gut. The leg maybe. A flesh wound. Or the thigh. A PRISON GUARD appears, as a waiter would, with a MUG OF COFFEE. BIG TONY (CONT’D) Thank you, Corey. Is there any of that cinnamon? The GUARD adds some cinnamon to the coffee.
