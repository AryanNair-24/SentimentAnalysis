7) 76) dialog: (to Doc) Listen here, Doc, I'm sorry for your loss, but I ain't gonna blow a bunch of smoke up your ass. The worst thing that can happen to anybody has landed on you, and now you got to deal with it.

18) 64) dialog: We can't?
18) 66) dialog: You mean, let him have the lie?
18) 68) dialog: I don't know, but it's never the lie. Sal walks toward the coffin, toward Doc and the Colonel. Mueller trails behind, slowed by his cane. Washington tak Mueller's arm and they move a little faster that way. As get closer, they can overhear the Colonel.

18) 82) dialog: So did we all - all of us here. And we still have to when we get the chance.
18) 84) dialog: I don't know. That's why I'm askin'.
18) 86) dialog: Were you there, when it happened? (CONTINUED)
18) 89) dialog: Where were you?
18) 91) dialog: With all due respect, Doc here ought to get to talk to somebody who was. You weren't. (to Washington) Were you? Washington hesitates, glances at the Colonel staring at h but then reluctantly answers.
18) 95) dialog: Where we was, pretty much. He'd like his son's face back.
18) 97) dialog: You quittin'?
18) 100) dialog: We'll know in a minute or two. Sal sees the Colonel once again approaching Doc so he wan over to him.
18) 101) dialog: Yo, Doc. Doc looks up.
18) 102) dialog: What's it gonna be here? Doc stands up straight, looks the Colonel in the eye.
18) 114) dialog: Forget about it. They stand silently, awkwardly for a moment. What now?
18) 116) dialog: We could do that. We'd need help liftin' it up. Maybe we...

19) 4) dialog: Before you bail on us. Mueller stares straight ahead.
19) 5) dialog: So, what's on your agenda? Read the bible all the way home, leftover ham for supper, say a little prayer...
19) 7) dialog: I feel I owe him one. Nothin' more, nothin' less.
19) 10) dialog: All the more reason.
19) 12) dialog: Doc wouldn't have ended up doing two years in the brig, that's for sure. And we wouldn't have had to see what we did.
19) 14) dialog: You don't remember?
19) 16) dialog: A certain platoon buddy, shot, writhing around on the ground dying, with nothing to help him cause we'd taken all the morphine for ourselves.
19) 18) dialog: Maybe.
19) 20) dialog: Yeah, and we did nothin'. Sometimes you ought to do a little more. Sal sees a Ryder agency and pulls to the curb.

20) 23) dialog: (smiling) That's all right. It wasn't my family.
20) 27) dialog: His holiness? His holiness can't hardly walk, let alone handle a big rig with a hydraulic lift.
20) 29) dialog: I'll drive it myself.
20) 31) dialog: Yes, ma'am. I be the wheelman. Paranoia deepens.

21) 9) dialog: ‘God's eyes?' God don't have no eyes.
21) 11) dialog: A reckoning?
21) 14) dialog: Then great - then I reckon I'll take that opportunity to stand at attention and say to God, "Hey, where were You when they were rapin' children or with the genocide and all that? Where were You when they flew airplanes into buildings, killin' thousands of folks just goin' to work, and the murderers shouting Your name, or You by some other name. Same difference. Where were You when Doc's kid was buyin' Cokes and some raghead blew his face off?" You see, I ain't gonna explain myself to God, I'm gonna make Him explain Himself to me!
21) 16) dialog: And I'm bettin' at the end of it, if the fucker even exists he'll say "Get your ass in here, you're my kind of dude." (beat) At least that's what I'm hopin'. If He's a tight-ass God, I'm fucked.

27) 5) dialog: Fuck you.
27) 7) dialog: Will you sit the fuck down? Look at me - all my future is behind me. I got a scrambled brain held together with a steel plate. And they look at me and what do they see? A fuckin' terrorist!
27) 9) dialog: Oh they're sorry. Sorry they didn't smoke our asses. A KNOCK on the door. They look at each other, like, what Sal eventually shrugs his shoulders and Doc cautiously op the door.

33) 6) dialog: You didn't hang with the brothers? Washington looks up at him.
33) 8) dialog: Sounds a lot like his father.
33) 10) dialog: Doc is not a dishonest man.
33) 13) dialog: That could have been any of us. He got fucked. I know things you don't.
33) 15) dialog: Doc was a lot younger than us, a kid, and technically he was in the Navy. He wanted to be our friend and we took advantage of it. We'd done him a favor and now he was doing one for us. But then it all went to shit and someone had to take the fall. C'mon up with us for a while. Redman here will look after your friend.
33) 18) dialog: No, you have to get out of here for a while.

34) 26) dialog: Jesus, kid...
34) 28) dialog: So you joined the Marines to get away from all that in Oakland?

35) 25) dialog: You need one of those mobile phones. You could be talking to her right now. Ten year-old kids have ‘em. They've practically quit making pay phones.
37) 1) dialog: I got your metaphoricals - dangling! Stick to the story!
37) 4) dialog: And it was the company fucking commander's doing! He's the one who told us to take a couple of days off and get Doc's ass over to Disneyland before he had a total meltdown.
37) 6) dialog: He sure as shit was, and the biggest one was that it was time for him to get his cherry busted. How old were you, Washington, first time?
37) 8) dialog: I rest my fucking case! My point exactly. Doc was eighteen.
37) 11) dialog: One year worse. It was time.
37) 14) dialog: Don't wreck my story. Believe me kid, he was ready. We killed some time in the bars then found the perfect little whorehouse.

37) 18) dialog: Jesus, what the hell has happened to your basic GI?
37) 22) dialog: Yielded to 'em? You smoked ‘em, drank ‘em, and fucked every impulse! Old Mueller the Mauler here would get the five dollars/ five minute special - he was like a jackrabbit. Sal makes a quick humping motion. Mueller fights a smile. (CONTINUED)

37) 28) dialog: Next day, I gotta admit, I was sick of hearing about that little Asian whore. Oh, Doc was quite proud of himself. Said he had a hard-on so big he couldn't bend his fingers or blink his eyes. Another round of big laughs.
37) 29) dialog: Fuck me... God, I really miss that, having a boner you can hang a towel on. My johnson used to stand up and watch me shave, now it watches me pull up my socks. They all crack up.

You could sit right here and dial her up and you wouldn't have to get off the stool and hobble the full length of this place and have to stand on your feet next to the shitter just to say, "I miss you, dear, I hope you still love me, even though I used to fuck whores." Though on his way, Mueller swings his cane around toward Sal's head, just missing as Sal ducks.
40) 5) dialog: I'm still too quick for you, floatin' like a butterfly. Mueller continues on as Sal waves to the bartender.
40) 6) dialog: One more, please, before Grandpa Moses gets back. (CONTINUED)

40) 14) dialog: County coroner. 50 LATER - Mueller has rejoined the group. 50
40) 15) dialog: Request permission to have another, sir?
40) 17) dialog: Barkeep, I'm gonna have just one more drink... and then I'm gonna have another.
40) 20) dialog: No problem, really. I think I got it down. (offers toast) Born in pain, live in fear, die alone. He chugs it.
40) 22) dialog: Nope, though my mom was half Italian. I got the best of both - I'm an Irish drinker and an Italian lover. Doc has been watching the TV above the bar. It's the same footage of Saddam getting his physical exam, along with o shots, like the picture of his two sons displayed after t were killed.
40) 24) dialog: I guess he thought it was worth it.
40) 27) dialog: Who? The cheerleader? Sal gets up and goes over to the bartender.

42) 9) dialog: Get out. Now, that's a helluva deal. (CONTINUED)
42) 12) dialog: You two fuckers! Get you some phones, right now.
42) 15) dialog: Done! Barkeep, a couple phones for my partners here.
42) 22) dialog: What if you fall down? A real possibility with your gimpy knee. And you're in a ditch, and you can't get up, and nobody can see you, and it starts to rain, and the ditch fills up with water? Looks like you're gonna drown. Farewell, old Reverend Mueller. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
42) 24) dialog: Ah, but with your wireless phone you can call for help.
42) 26) dialog: Sold!
43) 0) text: Sal hurries on ahead of the other two, dialing a number o his new phone. He ducks into an enclave off the street an momentarily out of sight. Mueller's phone rings and he fumbles to answer.
43) 2) dialog: (disguised voice) Is this Reverend Mueller?
43) 4) dialog: This is God. It don't count against your minutes to talk with me. They've now caught up with Sal, who emerges with a big sm on his face.

45) 3) dialog: Let me point out something to you. The butt-ugliest shot in basketball is the slam dunk. What does it mean, anyway? What does it say about the dude who stuffs it?
45) 6) dialog: Dudes were tall before. They didn't go around hammerin' the ball through the hoop every time down the court. Ugly fuckin' shot and now they're stuck with it. Hangin' on the hoop, all that shit. Now, you take the fade-away jump shot; aman is covered, fenced away from the basket, he goes up, drops back, arcs that puppy over the defense. Beautiful. Elegant. Earl-the-Pearl skillful.
45) 8) dialog: Well, but they interrupt the fucking action. They're boring and there are too many of them. You're not supposed to be bangin' into each other. Fouls should be shameful, but, fuck, there ain't no shame anywhere anymore.
45) 10) dialog: Only once. They fall silent, then resume their meal.
45) 11) dialog: Boston was where he was from. He expects someone to say something but no one does.
45) 12) dialog: I'm checking to see if he's got any family still there.
45) 15) dialog: What does that have to do with it? (CONTINUED)
45) 18) dialog: Pretty much.
45) 20) dialog: It's what I got instead of God.

48) 2) dialog: Who?
48) 4) dialog: Fuck, Doc, it's too early in the day.
48) 6) dialog: I don't know. Weird-ass A-rab names. Hugo and Queasy, like that.

48) 11) dialog: You forgot sexist. Fair to everybody. What did you name your kids?

48) 15) dialog: After old Sal. I ever have a kid I'll name him after you, Dick. First he'll be little Dick, then he'll grow up to be big Dick.
48) 18) dialog: Your Sally, if you'll make the introductions. Sal once again jumps out of range of Mueller's cane.
48) 20) dialog: Seriously though, padre, can I ask you a personal question?
48) 22) dialog: How come you married a black woman? (CONTINUED)
48) 25) dialog: Don't you tell me you never had a white woman. It was the 70s.
48) 27) dialog: Oh, yeah, I'm gaga for the sisters myself. And they dig me too. Well, a couple of ‘em did... fora time... then I'd say somethin' stupid.
48) 29) dialog: ‘Course I had a couple bouts of yellow fever too... and always did have a sweet tooth for the Latin babes. I got nothin' against white women, mind you. They're okay, some of ‘em. But we were talkin' about you marrying a black woman.
48) 31) dialog: That's why I'm being so polite about it.
48) 33) dialog: Whoa. To marry a black girl?
48) 35) dialog: He told you that?
48) 38) dialog: Like He told the Reverend Pat Robertson who was gonna win the election?
48) 40) dialog: How come God never talks to me?
48) 42) dialog: But He does talk to you?
48) 44) dialog: So he does speak to you.
48) 48) dialog: Where was that, bump into him on the street?
48) 52) dialog: Hallelujah! And there was Ruth.
48) 55) dialog: Sorry the fuck I asked. (beat) If God wants to keep holdin' out on me, I get it. But would it kill Him to pat me on the shoulder or shake my hand like a man? And if he'd also like to deliver a nice black girl with a great ass, so much the better.

We follow the mortuary affairs detail through the baggage/storage area of the train station and down an elevator to the loading dock where a hearse, and the fune director LELAND await.
51) 2) dialog: We're long overdue, the way I figure. She ought to know the truth and we ought to be men enough to say it.
51) 4) dialog: I got O'Toole to call his granddaughter and have her look it up for us on the world wide web.
51) 6) dialog: The truth. If it'd a been me, I'd want the other guys to go see my family. (CONTINUED)

57) 3) dialog: Even morticians better watch out - they might be outsourcing undertakin' next. (CONTINUED)
57) 6) dialog: So were the American factories. We could make anything, quality stuff. That's how we won two world wars. Don't be surprised if somebody figures out that it's cheaper to ship a body to Mexico and back than to do it up here. They'll ship it to China or India once they figure out it'll save 'em a buck. Don't matter how good you are. (new mumbly thought) Just a matter of time till they start outsourcing soldiering. Hell, get a bunch of starving young people from all over the world, put ‘em in a uniform and tell ‘em to try to stay alive. When their tour is over we ship 'em back to where they came from... no VA hospitals, or pensions. You lost an arm? You got PTSD? Tough shit, we're flushing you down...

61) 8) dialog: Move to Norfolk. You could work in my bar.
61) 10) dialog: Trust me - it ain't that hard. (CONTINUED)
61) 13) dialog: That's my fault. I let it go. It needs new blood. We could get the grill part going again. I need a partner.
61) 15) dialog: Yeah. The bar'd be half yours, and when I bite it, it'll be all yours.
61) 17) dialog: This ain't paying off no debt. I really do need a partner, and I got nobody to leave the place to. You could stay with me for a while, but then you'd have to find your own place, 'cause I like to pursue the ladies and, frankly, you'd cramp my style.
61) 18) dialog: You thinkin' about it?
61) 20) dialog: Might be time for another BCD in your life. Doc smiles.
