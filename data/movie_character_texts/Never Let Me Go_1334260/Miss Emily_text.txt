29) 3) dialog: There are several points of order today. The first is that Madame Marie-Claude is visiting us today, and will be examining your works. MISS EMILY turns to acknowledge MADAME, who nods in reply MISS EMILY (CONT’D) We will of course extend her every curtesy, and make her feel most welcome. MISS EMILY pauses a moment. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) Second point of order. It has come to my attention that three burned cigarettes were discovered, hidden behind a pot in the flower garden. MISS LUCY holds up a glass jam jar, containing the offending cigarette butts. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) I know that on occasion students have seen some of the caretakers or delivery men smoking cigarettes. But I must emphasise, once again, that it is much, much worse for a student of Hailsham to smoke than anyone else. I should not have to explain that students of Hailsham are special.

31) 1) dialog: The appropriate friction between penis and vagina should result in orgasm for both parties. Watching MISS EMILY, fascinated, but not convulsed in either amusement or embarrassment, is KATHY’S class. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) What constitutes appropriate friction will vary according to the physiology of the sexual partners. MISS EMILY uses her hand to raise the SKELETON’S hips. 39 SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p26. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) Here, I am illustrating how - by arching her back, or perhaps with the aid of a pillow - the woman can arrange herself to create the precise kind of friction she requires. MISS EMILY releases the SKELETON’S hips and turns to the class. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) The various positions and pleasures of intercourse must not blind you, however, to its inherent dangers. You are already aware of sexually transmitted diseases, which can wreak havok on otherwise perfectly healthy bodies. MISS EMILY pauses a moment, distracted by a stray thought pattern. Then: MISS EMILY (CONT’D) But some dangers are more complex and insidious. Sex affects the emotions in ways you can never expect. And we can’t legislate for that which we do not expect. Beat.

MISS EMILY (CONT’D) A replacement will be found for her, but in the meantime her classes will be divided between Miss Geraldine and myself. MISS EMILY pauses. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) It is hard, is it not - Abruptly, MISS EMILY breaks off. In the assembly hall, the silence feels like a non- sequitur. MISS EMILY drifts inside a private thought pattern. Children and guardians wait for her to continue. Which, after a few moments, she does. With a heat injected into her voice. Anger rising. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) It is hard, is it not, to continue in the face of deliberate subversion. There are those who would seek to thwart us. This is clear. It is manifestly - Another abrupt stop. A couple of GUARDIANS exchange a glance. MISS EMILY (CONT’D) - clear. MISS EMILY closes her eyes. Talks now to an interior voice, losing track of the faces before her.
