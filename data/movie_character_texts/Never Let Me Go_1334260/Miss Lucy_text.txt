14) 23) dialog: I see. Bemused, but seeing the seriousness in KATHY’S face, MISS LUCY makes an effort to be precise. MISS LUCY (CONT’D) So - what was it I said? I believe I was trying to calm him down, because he seemed so upset. And he explained that he was often teased about things like sport, and art. So I told him that he shouldn’t get upset at these things. The other children are only teasing him to get a reaction.

The children don’ know what MISS LUCY is about to say. But they sense it is seismic. So they sit, and wait. Until she speaks.
46) 1) dialog: I don’t think I can keep silent anymore. If no one else will talk to you, I will. The wind from the open window blows a couple of papers of her desk. As they drift to the floor, TOMMY, in the front row, make a move to pick them up. SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p38. MISS LUCY (CONT’D) No, Tommy - please. I just want you all to listen. TOMMY slides back into his seat. Beat. Silence. On ARTHUR. Beat. Beat. MISS LUCY (CONT’D) The problem is that you have been told, and not told. That is what I’ve seen while I’ve been here. You have been told, but none of you really understand. So I’ve decided I’1l talk to you in a way that you will understand. MISS LUCY (CONT’D) Do you know what happens to children when they grow up? MISS LUCY (CONT’D) No - you don’t. Because nobody knows. MISS LUCY (CONT’D) They might grow up to become actors, and move to America. Or they might work in supermarkets, or teach in schools. They might become sportsmen, or bus conductors, or racing car drivers. They might do almost anything. MISS LUCY (CONT’D) But with you, we do know. None of you will go to America. None of you will work in supermarkets. None of you will do anything, except live out the life that has already been set out for you. MISS LUCY (CONT’D) You will become adults, but only briefly. Before you are old, before you are even middle-aged, you will start to donate your vital organs. (MORE)

MISS LUCY (CONT’D) You have to know who you are, and what you are. It’s the only way you'll lead decent lives. End on the reaction of the kids. Stunned. Not certain what to say, or do. Except remain locked to their seats, and wait for the moment to go away Apart from TOMMY, who now reaches down, picks up the fall papers, and hands them to MISS LUCY.
