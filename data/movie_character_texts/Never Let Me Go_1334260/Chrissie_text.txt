Entering the room is RODNEY, CHRISSIE’S boyfriend. As he walks behind CHRISSIE, he gives her shoulder a litt squeeze. Then sits beside her, and she slips her arm into his. As a gesture, it is clingy. As a rule, whenever RODNEY and CHRISSIE are near each other, they hold each other in such a way. All of them have slightly glazed expressions - - because they are watching the TV, which is showing a generic American sitcom, circa early nineties.

CHRISSIE bursts into tears. Although the intensity of her reaction might simply be he frustration at learning to drive, it feels somehow more than that.
