Sharon exits the car and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod. She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly. We can sense the strain.
14) 5) dialog: He's not here.
14) 7) dialog: I'm okay.

14) 18) dialog: What's happening?

14) 28) text: For good reason. Remember? LARRY
14) 34) dialog: I don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. People see it, they think we're in trouble here.

48) 0) text: Sharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house. It has a small yard with kids' toys strewn about and a tire- swing. She walks up on the porch and RINGS the DOORBELL. She hears VOICES inside, LARRY AND KATHY, a quick murmuring, low-voice argument, can't make out the words. In a moment, Larry opens the door.

48) 3) dialog: I thought you were on late shifts.
49) 1) dialog: What's up?

53) 5) dialog: I lost my temper. Things got out of hand. It won't...
53) 8) text: You want to hit someone?       Next time your 'temper' flares      up, Lar, and you just have to hit      somebody, you go home and hit your      father. LARRY

53) 11) text: You don't come in here... He pushes her into the wall. LARRY
54) 1) dialog: I bet you feel real proud of yourself, Shar, knocking me down in front of my family. You know what I've got in my hand? I've got a Polaroid picture of my busted-up face, and I'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. I'm going to turn you in to the police, Shar, and see how you like it. The message ends.     She stands there a moment.
62) 0) text: It is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on Larry's street and walking to the door. She knocks -- and takes a step back. Larry opens the door, already angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the blow.
62) 1) dialog: I don't want you around here.
62) 8) dialog: You asked for it -- calling me a coward. You knew I'd swing. You think I look bad now? Look at this. He has a Polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face.
62) 9) dialog: Nice, huh? Beautiful. The cops'll love this, right? Evidence. Don't you guys love evidence? He puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more.
62) 10) dialog: You wanted me to swing. She looks away.     She nods, speaks softly.
62) 12) dialog: But you're not sorry you hit me.
62) 16) dialog: Okay what? This is very hard for her.
62) 21) dialog: Why the hell not?
62) 23) dialog: Why not?!
62) 26) text: That's what you said. He makes her wait, thinking it over. LARRY
62) 28) dialog: And I don't want you to come to Mom and Dad's celebration... Her eyes snap to his, surprised.
62) 29) dialog: Not the church. Not the party. Stay away. I don't want you around. I don't want to see you, Shar. After another moment, she nods again -- and he snatches the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against her chest and walks away. The photo falls to the ground. Larry says without turning...
62) 30) dialog: Go get a life. ... and she snaps.
62) 36) dialog: I know. SHARON
102) 0) text: The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are up and milling about, many leaving the church. "See you at the house."

103) 6) dialog: How did you have the guts to walk into a church after breaking your word?
103) 8) dialog: Why even talk go me? You got what you wanted. You laugh about it? You tell your cop friends how you... SHARON
104) 27) dialog: They won't let me watch T.V.

104) 33) dialog: With what?
104) 35) dialog: She drank it.
104) 37) dialog: Hey, sport, you should go play outside.
104) 41) dialog: Stay away from my family. Then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without humor, speaking loudly.
104) 42) dialog: Hey, everybody, keep it down. Somebody might call the police. There is some nervous laughter, people watching them now. Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low.
104) 44) dialog: (to crowd)
104) 46) dialog: Why don't you give everybody a break -- and go home? In the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and SHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support there. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door. She walks to the door, opens    it, starts to leave, star to close the door behind her,    and she stops, take take breath, battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt and anger. She looks at that     nearly-closed door. She pushes it open and walks back    in. We see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the crowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads toward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen, avoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward the kitchen.
105) 9) dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
105) 13) dialog: Just get the hell out... And she turns on him in a fury that halts him.
105) 17) text: This isn't about you, Larry -- or you, either, Mom. This is between me and my father, so leave us alone for one goddam minute! She turns back to her father. SHARON
106) 14) text: Bye. She hands the microphone back and walks away as the surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother, Larry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door and leaves.
107) 0) text: Sharon exits    and starts to walk away. She sees Larry J look up from    his play. He smiles at her. She returns the smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on. she reaches    the gate, she notices something across the street that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and pleased.
