19) 3) text: I tackled a guy. Elanora is moving about the living room, picking up framed photographs and turning them face down. We don't see what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning them all in a routine way, used to this. ELANORA

80) 13) dialog: Catch?
95) 1) dialog: Pogo? Mrs. Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling her wheelchair toward Sharon. She has a smile for her -- but with some reserve.
95) 3) dialog: Elanora. Sharon nods, very held back.        She gestures toward t wheelchair self-consciously.
95) 5) dialog: (hopeful)
95) 11) dialog: Oh.   Yes. Sharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough cover in place, over her emotions.
95) 13) dialog: He shops for me. Twice a week.
95) 15) dialog: No.
95) 17) dialog: It's what he needs.
95) 19) dialog: Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man.
95) 21) dialog: I let him find his own way through it. Why did you come here, Sharon?
95) 23) dialog: You are helping him.
95) 28) dialog: Why not?
95) 30) dialog: Is that what you think?
95) 32) dialog: What happened?
95) 34) dialog: The cemetery! Elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head in worry.
95) 36) dialog: (upset)
95) 39) dialog: He knows the truth.
95) 44) dialog: That's his way. That's his way through all this. He made a wall -- around that whole day, that night -- other things, too. He keeps them behind the wall -- his little boy, my daughter. He can't help it. The cemetery?! Do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery? Can you imagine? Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as Mrs. Chu goes on.
95) 45) dialog: That's where it stares you in the face -- the loss. And it's too much sometimes. Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.
95) 46) dialog: See? I'm still finding my way through it. And Catch -- it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or... go by the cemetery.
95) 48) dialog: But he was coming back. Do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks? His apartment, his life, his music is coming back. He fell in love! He even got a job, Sharon -- for you. For the two of you. Isn't that coming back? Why do you have to rush? Everybody has to rush these days. Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed now, realizing, admitting.
95) 50) dialog: Scared of what?
95) 55) dialog: You were finding your way.    What else can we do? You think    I'm always sure what to say to   him, what not to say? I do what    I think is right and hope he   sees the love in it. She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing now, liking this girl.
95) 56) dialog: Look at you -- so worried now, so miserable. That's the love in it.
95) 58) dialog: I don't know. I really don't. But I think he'll see the love in what you did. Sharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with strength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad. Elanora watches her go.
