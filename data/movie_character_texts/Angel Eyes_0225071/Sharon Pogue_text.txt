1) 4) dialog: Can you hear me? (shouting, off)
1) 10) dialog: Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can you feel that? She holds on tight.     We see that our hand, held in her own, is bloody.
1) 11) dialog: That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on -- as hard as you can. We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the sights and sounds around us grow more clear.
1) 12) dialog: It's over, and I've got you, and you're safe. You're safe now. You got that? Don't let go. Don't let me go. But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of night sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TO LIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black night begins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and...
3) 0) text: Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner, ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car, driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.
3) 1) dialog: That car is older than they are.
3) 3) dialog: That's what I said.
3) 8) dialog: Don't we all. Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon has said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking her head.
3) 9) dialog: Get it together, officer. As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair. Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive on.
3) 11) dialog: I love Elvis hair. They were going two damn miles an hour. But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.
5) 0) text: This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight boys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off another by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.
6) 0) text: Sharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the Kid keeps mouthing off.

8) 2) dialog: I just dealt with the situation. The prisoner...
8) 7) text: I want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. All right? Are you taking notes? He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.
8) 9) dialog: He grabbed me.     End of story.
8) 11) dialog: If you think I crossed the line, put it in the report.
8) 18) dialog: Thanks. But  she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. She's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me.
8) 20) dialog: They all worry about that. They both smile wryly, driving on.
8) 21) dialog: You don't need to fix me, Robby, or fix me up. I don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing -- or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who I am inside my head. Anyway, I'm busy tonight.
8) 23) dialog: Yeah.   Hot and heavy.
13) 0) text: Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger in a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where alterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman is just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at Sharon, a real talker.
13) 5) dialog: Looks great.
13) 12) dialog: Their vows?
13) 15) dialog: Oh, yeah. We've had... there's been some problems with the mail in our building, so... I'll probably get it today. They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's been left out.
13) 16) dialog: So, I guess I'll see you.
14) 0) text: Robby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with a sign marked "POGUE CONSTRUCTION." Sharon exits the car and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod. She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly. We can sense the strain.
14) 4) dialog: I didn't see his truck, so...
14) 6) dialog: How you doing? She touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly gesture, a reaching out. He doesn't respond, only shrugs.
14) 8) dialog: Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big now.
14) 10) dialog: Is he looking more like you now -- or did he get lucky? She has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief, wry smile.
14) 13) dialog: Place is coming along nice. The octagon window. Dad's signature. But Larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her mind.
14) 14) dialog: Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about what's happening. He turns back to his work now as they speak, uncomfortable.
14) 19) dialog: (hurt)
14) 22) dialog: Mom told him?
14) 24) dialog: He's holding out, hah?
14) 26) dialog: It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's over ten years, and he won't let go of it.
14) 29) text: Let's just leave it. She stares, then... SHARON
14) 35) dialog: Nice seeing you, too. She walks away.     He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes back to work.
14) 37) dialog: Two more minutes. And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking now.
15) 0) text: The van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife. Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old. Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child. Kathy smiles, too.
15) 2) dialog: Hey, Champ, my God, look how big. She has a special affection for the boy -- who is subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality.
15) 4) dialog: Ow! You hurt my hand with that grip. Whew.
15) 10) text: How're you doing? Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look -- and connect.
15) 11) dialog: I'm semi-okay. I heard about the... ceremony and the party.
15) 14) text: Really. Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.       She Kathy's arm.
15) 15) dialog: Take it easy.    You too, Champ. The boy offers his little hand to shake again.
15) 16) dialog: Oh, no. You're not breaking my fingers again. They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car and Robby.
16) 4) text: Sharon is in the car beside Robby.
16) 8) text: A police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- now Robby   and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it. Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a shotgun.    This is RAY JULIETTE.

16) 16) text: Right behind you! (to man) Stop and lie down with your arms... shit. The man has jumped a fence.   Sharon follows.
16) 18) dialog: I see him! She goes over the fence, then Robby.
17) 0) text: The man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following. ROBBY
17) 6) dialog: Freeze!    Right there! Catch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off.
17) 21) dialog: I was dead.   Y'know. She glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks to her sergeant.
17) 22) dialog: He had me.    I was dead.
21) 0) text: It's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers. They're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too. They are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at it and says...
21) 8) dialog: I like how you're always asking the big questions, Ray. There is some laughter.     Ray is a smart-ass and a flir

21) 21) dialog: The head.   Do you mind?
21) 24) dialog: That reminds me, Ray. You still have that eye-liner you borrowed from me? She grins, leaving the laughter behind her.
22) 0) text: Sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring into the mirror. No smile now. We see into her mind for a second.

22) 8) dialog: We thought you wouldn't show.    Why you sitting here? He shrugs.
22) 10) dialog: I didn't have a chance to thank you. I'm Sharon Pogue. She puts out her hand. He stares at that hand for just half a beat before taking it. They shake. The feel of her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident, but he covers this.
22) 11) dialog: You look familiar.
22) 13) dialog: Why would you do that -- jump a man with a gun?
22) 16) dialog: He could've shot you. You have a death wish? You a bungee jumper?
22) 21) dialog: What d'you think about it now?
22) 23) dialog: For someone you don't even know?
22) 25) dialog: I never thought about it.
22) 27) dialog: Now I'm walking around this town because of you. Ever think about that? Maybe you should be a cop. CATCH
22) 30) dialog: Okay. What d'you do? You employed around here? Oh, God. Sorry. Every time I try to talk to somebody, it comes out like an interrogation.
22) 35) dialog: What?
22) 37) dialog: Does it work?
22) 39) dialog: Bullshit.
22) 41) dialog: Not in here.    It's mostly cops. Now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've seen from Catch. It's open and real and she is charmed by it.
22) 42) dialog: You have a nice smile. She's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for both of them. Sharon looks up, questioning, and the waitress nods toward the booth. Catch and Sharon see the cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. There is a hint of teasing in their grins. And now Sharon is more self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink and turning back to Catch.
22) 43) dialog: So... what were we talking about? Oh, yeah, you were giving me some line about starting a conversation.
22) 48) dialog: Okay.    I'll play. They clink glasses and drink.         Then...
22) 49) dialog: Tomorrow I've got a night watch shift. If the weather clears, in the morning I'll go hiking. If it rains, I'll go to the gym -- and the laundromat. Ten years from now... I want to be living in some mountainous place.
22) 51) dialog: Could be Tibet. Could be Colorado. Your turn. But now Ray Juliette is approaching the table.
22) 53) dialog: Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray. I'm taking off.
23) 0) text: As Catch and Sharon exit the building, walk toward her car.
23) 1) dialog: It's not a great neighborhood. Maybe I should walk you to your car.
23) 3) dialog: Want a ride home?
23) 5) dialog: It's starting to rain.   Don't be a hero. He hesitates, nervous about it, but then...
23) 7) dialog: Okay... ten years from now, what d'you want to be doing? They walk side by side a moment.      He shrugs.   Then - his open way...
23) 14) text: The only time I worry is when people tell me not to worry. SHARON
24) 1) text: I'm on Lundy Street, just off Pico. They drive a while. She notices his anxiety.     He grips the armrest when she speeds up. SHARON
24) 3) text: Streets are wet. SHARON
24) 11) dialog: Oh yeah?   What am I doing there?
24) 13) dialog: I'm not pissed off at you.
24) 15) dialog: Those guys  in the bar are my friends --  sort of. We work together,  we tell jokes and we bullshit,  but I can't say to them... She halts.
24) 23) dialog: What I want  is to know how you happened to  be walking by that parking lot  at that minute. What if you hadn' t been there? For a moment, she shows her fear.
24) 25) dialog: If you want -- you can come in for a minute.
25) 1) dialog: Want a drink?
25) 3) dialog: Sit down or something.
25) 5) dialog: You're not supposed to look around. I didn't have time to straighten up.
25) 10) dialog: It's rude. He turns to her.
25) 12) dialog: I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm mad. I don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are. That's all. Let's talk about something stupid.
25) 14) dialog: Okay -- one thing I don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. We were 'supposed to' meet. That sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access TV. You believe that?
25) 16) dialog: So, we... smell each other?   Who says that?
25) 22) dialog: You mean like   a duck? No. I think dead is   dead. I've been thinking about   it all day -- and I don't want to   think about it anymore. He looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down. He puts the glass on the table.
25) 23) dialog: Why'd you do that?
25) 27) dialog: Thanks for... coming up here.
25) 29) dialog: (flustered)
25) 35) dialog: Oh.    You're here as a medic.

Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break. The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the garden.
28) 1) dialog: It's looking great, Mom.
29) 4) dialog: Looks the same. Still smells like cigarettes. I thought he quit.
29) 6) dialog: Your hair looks nice. Her Mother touches her hair, self-consciously. She can't help glancing at her daughter in all that gear -- bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and that gun.
29) 8) dialog: I guess I'm well. Is this always here?
29) 10) dialog: Did Larry tell you I came by where he's working? Is that why you called me?
29) 12) dialog: Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to invite you.
29) 17) dialog: How come you're renewing your vows?
29) 19) dialog: Your idea?
29) 21) dialog: Wasn't it blessed before? Her Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them.
29) 23) dialog: I just what, Mom?
29) 25) dialog: Sorry.  I wish I did, too. (then, almost like a child)
29) 28) dialog: Hurt?    I hurt him? MOTHER
29) 29) text: Being arrested like that. Somebody doesn't forget that. SHARON
29) 36) text: Honey, nobody's punishing you. We're inviting you. Will you come? SHARON

29) 41) dialog: Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't want any trouble -- ever. I'll come to the ceremony. I won't come to argue, and I won't come in uniform. They each get a small, sad smile.
29) 43) dialog: I'd like you to send me an invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's a beautiful invitation. Her Mother starts to leave the room.

She puts the tape down, but it sticks to    her fingers. She tears it off a tries to throw it onto    the table, but it hangsoff her thumb. She sighs and     steels herself and dialsthe number.

37) 31) dialog: So what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to Denny's? You never said one word about yourself last night. What d'you do?
37) 33) dialog: What's the difference?! You're standing in my bedroom. That's the difference. Who are you?
37) 38) dialog: You're ducking. Don't duck. (then a thought)

54) 10) dialog: I don't want to talk. I don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a... 'angel of mercy' or... whatever. I don't care, but I don't want to hear about it. All right? I don't want to hear anything. She steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and turns to him.
54) 11) dialog: It's a bad night. He sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head on his chest. He embraces her fully, and the effect on him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit. She sighs. In a moment...
54) 12) dialog: This is good... but I'm too tired to stand up anymore. He walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then slowly, gently, he "disarms" her. He lifts her leg, takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the table. He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from the middle of her back. He reaches into her pants pocket and removes the Mace. From her shirt pocket he takes her I.D. shield. He has her lie down on the couch now, their faces close, eyes locked. They linger...
54) 13) dialog: You want to kiss me?
54) 17) dialog: Kiss me someplace I've never been kissed. He's not sure what to do. He begins to look her over -- as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. He starts slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Her shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he starts to move there, but checks her with a look. She shakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. He takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her eyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, and then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them to... No. He stops. She looks at him, a deep look, soft voice.
54) 18) dialog: Why do you stop? You always stop. She has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the deep pain. He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes a moment. Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the pillow. He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. Our TRUMPET MUSIC slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a while, and then --
56) 0) text: Sharon is peacefully asleep. He stands over her with troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look. He bends close to her face. He feels her breath on him. He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and very gently brushes her cheek. She stirs. He does it again. She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. He smiles at her.
57) 0) text: Sharon is driving Catch home. They are now on a main boulevard of stores, office buildings. They stop at a light. Both are surprised by a voice calling out from the pedestrians crossing the street.
57) 3) text: (to Sharon) Drive, will you? Pindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him, wondering.
57) 9) dialog: What?       You owe him money? But his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer. Then... CATCH
58) 0) text: Sharon exits the car and locks it, staring at Catch. SHARON
58) 3) dialog: If you're in trouble with him, maybe I can help.
58) 8) dialog: This is not a great place to walk.
58) 10) dialog: I work here.   It's not fine.
58) 12) dialog: Besides the shootings, break-ins, rapes, cart thefts? We've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over. Can't catch him. Got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three. Can't find him. As someone approaches them, Catch makes eye contact and smiles a small, friendly smile-in-passing. He gets a brief smile in return. He and Sharon amble on. He does it again.
58) 13) dialog: You know everybody here? He nods to another YOUNG MAN he's never met...
58) 18) dialog: Try what?
58) 23) dialog: I feel like a jerk. I feel like a smiley face. Catch smiles, Sharon frowns, but when an OLD MAN passes, she gives a small smile. The Man lights up.
58) 44) text: Hey -- police. The Woman speeds her car away.       Sharon gets in Catch face.
58) 45) dialog: Jesus Christ, Catch.
58) 51) text: No. No, I just... some people are walking around blind... SHARON
58) 53) text: Don't tell me what my problem is! SHARON
58) 56) dialog: Blind to what?! CATCH
58) 58) dialog: Or like me, right? What about you? How come you can see? That stops him, the darkness rising.    He looks about, trying to contain it. CATCH
58) 60) dialog: Yeah.    Fine.
58) 65) dialog: I'll be out. She turns and walks away.      He is still angry, but sor to see her go.
60) 0) text: Sharon and Robby    are patrolling in their unit. Robby i driving. Sharon     is watching out the window with a dee eyed look, a bit    down because of her argument with Cat She is staring as    she rolls along.
62) 0) text: It is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on Larry's street and walking to the door. She knocks -- and takes a step back. Larry opens the door, already angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the blow.
62) 2) dialog: Let's go talk in the yard. They stare. She starts walking back into his darkening front yard, looking over her shoulder. She walks to a tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. He goes back inside, but leaves the door open. In a moment he reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him.
62) 4) dialog: You took a swing at me.
62) 11) dialog: I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
62) 13) dialog: Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's face?! LARRY
62) 14) text: That's not your business! Nobody called you, right? She didn't ask for you to come here. This is my family. You don't get it, 'cause you've got no family. Nobody. So you try to run everybody else's life. Jesus Christ -- get your own life. That's the goddam problem. Get your own goddamn life. Their stare holds, but she is giving way. SHARON
62) 20) dialog: Don't go to my department, all right?
62) 22) dialog: Larry...
62) 24) dialog: Because the job's all I got. LARRY
62) 25) text: That's what I said, right?    No life. She nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper. SHARON
62) 27) text: And you won't come around here. You won't call. Ever. In a moment Sharon nods.
62) 34) dialog: I got a life! The words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's not crying. Larry stops and turns.
62) 35) dialog: How the hell would you know about my life?!
62) 37) text: You know nothing about me, because you don't want to know. The family doesn't want to know me. Well, too bad. Sharon's got a life. Sharon's got a boyfriend. Sharon's going hiking in the morning with her boyfriend. She's not sitting alone miserable like you want. Too bad! She reaches down, snatches the Polaroid photo off the ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as hard as it is possible to slam it.
63) 3) dialog: I thought you walked all over the city.
63) 9) dialog: My favorite lunch spot is another half mile.
64) 0) text: Sharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges up and collapses near a stream-fed pond. She hands him a sandwich, but he shakes his head.
64) 3) dialog: I'm okay.   Everything's code four.
64) 5) dialog: Everything's fine.
64) 10) dialog: Yesterday -- you mean you want to hear about it?
64) 12) dialog: No kidding. Why? You never talk about yesterday.
64) 14) dialog: Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we rolled on a 415. Juliette and Sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so I did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and I usually do all right but the smell got to me, and I can still smell her. Then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and I carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and I wanted to punch her rock-head mother, and then shift ended and I had a nice visit with my brother Larry. He is staring at her.     He takes her hands, holds them.
64) 17) dialog: Sorry you asked?
64) 22) dialog: Well... I feel better now.    You feel better?
64) 24) dialog: What are you doing?! She is surprised, smiling, as he plunges into the pond, her darkness dissipating.
64) 25) dialog: Catch! There's no swimming here! And you can't be naked in a state park! He dives under and surfaces again.
64) 27) dialog: What if a park ranger comes?! He dives and surfaces once more.       We STAY CLOSE ON h
64) 34) dialog: Looks like a bad one.
64) 36) dialog: We should be thinking about lunch. We have to pack up.
64) 38) dialog: Some of us have to work. (teasing)
64) 44) dialog: Oh?   You remember that?   Working? She smiles and walks off toward the food. He stares after her, his smile fading into thoughtfulness, memory, as he dresses.
67) 0) text: In a seedy parking lot, tough part of town, Robby and Sharon are arresting two teenage girls. One of them is leaning on the car as Sharon searches her. Robby stands back with the other (cuffed) girl. Robby is staring at Sharon through this moment -- noting the difference in her, still very professional -- but softer. The girl is upset, near tears. Sharon is gentle in her search.
67) 1) dialog: I have to check these jacket pockets. What's your name -- Allison? The girl nods, not trusting her voice.
67) 2) dialog: I need to unsnap this, Allison. I'm checking your waistband. You got to Whitney School?
67) 7) dialog: Lift your arms higher. Got a good basketball team at St. Mark's. You play basketball?
68) 0) text: Sharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling down a residential street of apartment buildings. A parked car is BLASTING MUSIC, and Robby halts beside it. Sharon starts making dancing moves to the MUSIC, sitting there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves, kidding it. Then Robby HITS the HORN to get the driver's attention in the parked car. Robby makes a gesture to lower the volume, and the man SNAPS OFF his TAPE. Robby rolls on, glancing at Sharon. She wears a small smile, checking their beat. ROBBY
68) 1) text: What's going on, Pogo?    You're not happy or anything? SHARON
68) 3) dialog: He says before I came along, he thought he was dead. Sounds better when he says it -- (stops abruptly)
68) 6) dialog: Shhh.   Sh! Robby stops the unit, rolling the windows down.     They hear the FARAWAY SOUND of...
68) 7) dialog: The trumpet player. Robby pulls over.
68) 12) dialog: Wow.
68) 14) dialog: Look at that moon. They stare at the full moon. In a moment, we hear the sound of ROARING CARS, their TIRES SCREECHING as they turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off the other and force it to stop. The two male drivers are screaming at each other. Robby shakes his head.
68) 18) dialog: Are you McGuire?
68) 20) dialog: Mark McGuire?
68) 22) dialog: Then put that bat away.   Put it in your trunk. Now. The man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk.
68) 27) text: You lying bastard! The man charges, bat in hand, and Sharon makes a flying tackle, bringing him down hard on the street -- and we immediately...
69) 1) dialog: Ow.     Ow!
69) 3) dialog: No.     That's good. Deeper. CATCH
69) 5) dialog: Like a truck.
69) 7) dialog: Pickup.        Ow.   Ow! That's really good. She begins to moan as he digs out the pain. He is fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her naked back, and she is moaning -- so he stops and takes a breath.
69) 13) dialog: Don't get oil on it.
69) 15) dialog: Yes. Just put it down.   I'm not going.
69) 17) dialog: If I go, my brother'll hurt    me with the department. I got     mad and knocked him down. All     they need is a complaint. Just     leave it alone and keep rubbing.     Okay? She moans in pleasure as he rubs, trying to push all other thoughts away.
69) 19) dialog: Can't you rub without talking? (then)
69) 23) dialog: Oh, Jesus! But we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and, for once, she shares it.
69) 27) dialog: My father used to knock us around, all of us. But I'm the one who called the cops -- finally. (pause)
69) 28) text: They say I turned against the family. Catch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking at Sharon with more tenderness than ever. In a moment...
69) 30) dialog: You don't know anything about it. So forget it.
69) 32) dialog: Oh, yeah?   What about it?
69) 34) dialog: I didn't close the door.
69) 36) dialog: Oh, sure. What if they don't deserve it?
69) 38) dialog: You have all the answers.
69) 43) dialog: You close with your family? That hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now, looking a little lost. He doesn't answer.
69) 44) dialog: See?    So why should I listen to you? But as he works her back in silence, we see her facing her pain and thinking through it.
70) 0) text: Just after dawn. Catch is on the couch, stirring in his sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings. We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down. In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom.
72) 0) text: The night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a lot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small dance floor. We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE AT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who mostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there. The music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a more up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and pulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and follows. This number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more   fr out there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and   s laughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting   wi and playful, and it's something to see. We LINGER ON    t joy and abandon. She's earned it. They go a little crazy, happy crazy, and in a while we...
72) 3) text: What's your favorite song? He rises -- as if to go to the band with a request.     S smiles, spent. SHARON
72) 6) text: From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano, Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder.
73) 0) text: We keep the sound of CATCH'S TRUMPET going as he and Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms around each other. In a moment, he stops. He can't go another step. He has to kiss her. He holds her face and comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her say softly.
73) 1) dialog: Where I've never been kissed. He stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest moment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS once as they break, staring.
73) 5) dialog: Oh, God. We WIDEN to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20 feet away. Ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to say...
73) 7) dialog: Go away.
73) 9) text: No thanks, Ray. Everything's code four. Go away. Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment. She gestures behind them at the jazz club. SHARON
73) 11) text: (impressed; to Catch) Oh, yeah? What d'you play? SHARON
74) 0) text: Sharon is asleep, alone in the tousled bed.
75) 0) text: Catch is dressed, putting a leash on Bob, glancing into the bedroom at Sharon.
76) 0) text: Sharon is waking, sleepy. She rises, finds a robe and slips it on, calling out softly for Catch.
77) 0) text: Sharon sees that Catch and Bob are gone. She drifts to the window, looks at the day, looks down at the street -- and she sees them.
78) 13) dialog: She has entered the park and witnessed this from a distance. She is angling toward the playground.
78) 29) dialog: Catch!   Catch! It takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he quickly turns and sees her approaching.
78) 30) dialog: Are you all right? Your elbow's bleeding. I... But he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in.
78) 31) dialog: What's wrong? He walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she catches up again.
78) 32) dialog: Where are you going? Catch -- you're scaring me. Please... But he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way, faces him.
78) 33) dialog: Please, Catch, don't... Can't you talk to me?! He turns and walks off, heading for the street.
78) 37) dialog: Please.   Wait.     I... Catch! He has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of the cars, but desperate to get away. She watches this, frozen, as HORNS BLARE. He has to stop in the middle of the street to wait a moment, and he stands there, stricken.
79) 0) text: As Robby and Sharon's police unit moves along with traffic. In a moment they pull over and park beside an office building. It is the same building the man entered shouting, "Catch!" Sharon watches the building's entrance. After a while...
79) 2) dialog: Watching for somebody.       Tall guy. 40s. Grey-blond hair.
79) 7) dialog: It's personal.
79) 9) dialog: Chill. She watches the building, studying the people who come and go.
81) 0) text: Sharon is still staking out the office building. Robby is fidgeting. She just keeps watching. When Robby begins to speak, she puts up a hand to stop him, going very still, staring out the window at the man who Catch was afraid of, Richard Pindella. The man enters the building. Sharon gets out of the car, intense...
81) 1) dialog: Give me fifteen. And she hurries after the man.
82) 0) text: As Sharon enters, sees the man at the elevators. He gets into an elevator, and she just misses him. She watches the elevator indicator. It stops at two. She hurries up the stairs.
83) 0) text: As Sharon bangs into a hallway through the stairway door. She looks one way, looks the other way down the long hall, and sees the man just entering a door. She walks to that door. It is marked "private." She knocks and walks in.
84) 6) dialog: I'm not sure.    Who am I speaking to?
84) 8) dialog: What kind of doctor?
84) 10) dialog: Do you know a Catch Lambert?
84) 12) dialog: I... need to talk to you. He glances at his watch, worried for Catch.
84) 14) dialog: Are you a...?
84) 16) dialog: And Mr. Lambert...
84) 21) dialog: He's your patient. He's your patient we... know all this. This is police business. I'm officer Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D.
84) 23) dialog: In general. In general.   He's your patient, and he...
84) 25) dialog: Why did he walk away?
84) 27) text: (desperate) You can help by just   telling me what's in the public   record. It'll take me half a   day to do a search. Can you tell    me? Just... She is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions coming through. Pindella sees this. She sits on the edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly. SHARON
84) 33) dialog: More. He takes that in, leans back on the desk.
84) 35) dialog: What accident?
84) 37) dialog: A bus... and a van. Where?        On... the freeway? Something is pulling at her memory. Her vision turns inward, and she stops breathing for a moment -- remembering. She was there. And here we get a...
84) 41) dialog: Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't remember.
84) 46) dialog: (quietly)
84) 50) dialog: Does he... still see her?
84) 53) dialog: He says... he doesn't remember the accident.
84) 55) dialog: I think he remembers me. Very subdued now, she asks...
84) 56) dialog: How does he live? PINDELLA
84) 61) dialog: Trumpet. As he says that, we hear our TRUMPET MUSIC begin -- a fast and furious MUTED TRUMPET, incredible RIFFS, and we use this to carry us, as we...
85) 0) text: Sharon is in the report room, using the computer, hunting. We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen. She is searching the police records to find the accident. The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads.
86) 0) text: We MOVE THROUGH Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS. We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply, sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is looking at that mural of the mountains and through this to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises and goes to the phone, punches in a number.
87) 0) text: He is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard, sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up -- as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven way, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE breaks through, he stops suddenly. He waits. His MACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS. We INTERCUT the call as Sharon's voice comes on, subdued.
87) 1) dialog: Catch, it's me. Can you pick up? But he sits there, waiting, listening.
87) 2) dialog: Why don't we... meet tomorrow? I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet me there? Westwood and Cole. About two o'clock. Okay?
88) 0) text: Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village not far from Santa Monica. He is waiting, glancing over the passing crowds for Sharon. He sees her. She is off duty, out of uniform. He watches her until she spots him. She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and sadness in her smile. They walk to each other and stop and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking slowly, and he walks beside her. There is a strain lingering between them.
88) 2) dialog: That's okay.
88) 4) dialog: You don't have to explain. He glances at her, wondering, walking along.
88) 6) dialog: So you're the trumpet player who was waking people up -- on my beat. They walk along in silence a moment.
88) 8) dialog: On your roof? That's why we couldn't find you.
88) 17) text: You can trust me, you know. She takes his hand. SHARON
88) 20) dialog: Like I held you before.   Like I did -- at the accident. He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it shakes her.
88) 24) dialog: What makes it so... unspeakable, Catch? What makes it like that? He begins to shut down, to grow cold and numb and not hear this.
88) 25) dialog: Is it because you were driving? He turns away, closing his eyes.
88) 26) dialog: I read the reports, and it wasn't your fault. It wasn't. Is it because you survived and they didn't? She puts her hand out for him again.
88) 27) dialog: Catch. Please. Hold on, and we'll go in there together... He does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a few steps toward that building.
88) 28) dialog: You can talk to them. You can say goodbye or I love you or whatever... He pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of rage over his pain.
88) 30) dialog: To help you.
88) 32) dialog: We're not. We're not fine, Catch. Nothing is fine -- no matter how much you pretend. It is as if she's fighting for his life again -- and her own.
88) 36) dialog: You pretend that nothing happened. You walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside.
88) 38) dialog: Then walk in there. He can't even look at the place.
88) 39) dialog: Walk in there, and I'll walk in with you. Walk in there and say it's real -- what happened is real. Your family died.
88) 43) dialog: So you can have a life! CATCH
88) 48) dialog: Because it happened! Because it's the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry it happened, but...
88) 50) dialog: Catch -- take my hand.    Please.
88) 52) dialog: I can't.
88) 54) dialog: Because I want it too much. I want everything with you. I want all of you -- not just the part that isn't hiding and running away...
88) 56) dialog: Not anymore. It doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone -- because we're the family now. We can be the family...
88) 61) dialog: I just... want to say...
88) 63) dialog: When you're ready, I'll be there for you. I just want to say that. And she turns and walks away. He watches her go, angry, scared and sorry for what he said. He takes a few steps after her, wanting to call out and to stop her. We see him almost call to her. He is coming apart, watching her, needing her so much, but unable to call out. He is shaky. He takes a glance at that building, then away. He stares after Sharon -- but she's out of sight now. He steels himself, then looks across the street again at that building. He is desperately afraid. He stares at the building a long while. He begins to cross the street. He makes fists to keep from shaking. He walks to the entrance.
90) 0) text: The new shift    of cops is heading for its cars -- Sharo and Robby, Ray    and Sanchez, others. The mood is relaxe teasing talk,    but Sharon is way down. She tries to pus her mood away    and tough through it.
90) 8) dialog: No, I think I'll turn vegetarian. RAY
90) 9) text: Gotta have that meat to keep your strength up. SHARON
90) 10) text: How come it's not working for you? There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile. Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and takes us into...
92) 0) text: We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor, shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking for something. The PHONE RINGS. He ignores it. He is opening up each chart of music, shaking it out, searching. Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with sorrow.
92) 1) dialog: Catch.  Can you... pick up? (pause) Will you call me? He keeps searching, seeming to not even    listen. The MACHINE CLICKS OFF. He shakes the next     music chart an something falls out. He stares at this     piece of paper picks it up, slowly turns it over. It     is a picture of himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in    crayon by a fo or five-year-old. Catch stares at this     with a depth t goes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.
93) 0) text: Sharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall parking lot, exiting their car. No rush. She's still very downbeat. As they walk from the car, he keeps glancing at her, concerned for her.
93) 3) text: The little market there. They came through a back window last night. Mostly vandalism... They walk on, but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk, a little child, three years old or so, toddles out the door of a shop. A SKATEBOARDER is rattling along, and Sharon makes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently...
93) 4) dialog: Whoa... ... and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes by shouting...
93) 6) text: Oh, God, thank you. Billy! She picks up her boy, walks back into the shop. Sharon stands there -- as it all blooms inside of her, rocks her, really, this little act, evoking Catch, who he is, what he said and what he means to her. Robby is a few steps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet, looking around her now at the people walking among the shops and cafes. She picks one. She catches the eyes. She gives a brief smile. The smile is answered, shyly, kindly, the person moves on.
93) 11) dialog: There's something I have to do.    I need an address and phone.
93) 13) dialog: Elanora Chu. Robby looks at her, then nods, giving her this.
94) 0) text: We see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the front of Mrs. Chu's home. Robby waits in the unit.
95) 0) text: Sharon walks under that covered portico to the front door, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her a bit.
95) 2) dialog: I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all about the...
95) 4) dialog: I'm sorry for... what happened.     I know about the accident.
95) 10) dialog: No. I found out, and... I remembered. I was there.
95) 12) dialog: I guess he comes here a lot -- to talk to you.
95) 14) dialog: Oh. And when he comes here -- he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident?
95) 16) dialog: And you... let him do that?    All this time? Why?
95) 18) dialog: Walking all over the city like...
95) 20) dialog: But... you let him get so lost. Elanora is a bit defensive now.
95) 22) dialog: Because... I want to know how to help him.
95) 27) dialog: I don't think so.
95) 29) dialog: He... he was paying me back, I guess, for the accident, for helping him. That's why he felt... so close to me. But...
95) 31) dialog: But now he probably hates me. I...
95) 33) dialog: I took him to the cemetery, and...
95) 35) dialog: I thought it might help him... come back, you know? But he wouldn't even go in. He screamed at me.
95) 38) dialog: For the truth...
95) 40) dialog: But he won't even say it, or...
95) 47) dialog: I was trying to help him... come back to some kind of life. I...
95) 49) dialog: I was scared. I push so hard... when I'm scared.
95) 54) dialog: Losing him. So I did. I lost him. He won't talk to me. I... I didn't know what I was doing. Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away, studying Sharon's misery.
95) 57) dialog: Did I... make it worse for him?
96) 0) text: It's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her parents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to go through with this. We START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next to that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about, see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In the b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.
96) 1) dialog: I just came by to... wish you well. To... congratulate you and wish you well. Shit.
96) 6) dialog: dressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then --
96) 8) dialog: dressed differently, rewrapping it again and then --
96) 10) dialog: sitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap, looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad.
98) 0) text: The MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church, parking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. There is no one else outside the church. The ceremony has already begun. She's planned it that way. She enters the church as the MUSIC FADES OUT.
99) 0) text: As Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, but perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to glance over.
102) 0) text: The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are up and milling about, many leaving the church. "See you at the house." "See you at the party." Etc. A PHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the church. Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the little boy...
102) 2) dialog: Where do you want me? The Photographer turns to her, wondering.
102) 3) dialog: I'm the daughter.
102) 8) dialog: You both look so great.
102) 11) dialog: I just wanted to... The Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat, not warm either. No smile.
102) 13) dialog: Sure. He nods, then turns to greet well-wishers. Sharon is left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one old couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs. Vander) wearing her new blue dress, her HUSBAND beaming beside her.
102) 16) dialog: Not so big. (to Mrs. Vander)
102) 17) text: Nice dress. Sharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up with Larry and his family.
103) 0) text: As Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of the church, calling ahead.
103) 1) dialog: Larry...
103) 7) dialog: I have to be here. It's a chance to make things right, and I'm taking it.
103) 10) dialog: Here, Lar. She hands him something. It is the Polaroid photo. He looks at it, surprised. They lock eyes. She speaks softly. SHARON
104) 0) text: We're in the midst of the party. We see Sharon drifting a bit, a hello here and there. She feels out of place.
104) 5) dialog: Mom, I was going to fix his tie. His tie is crooked. She sighs, pushing through her hurt to say...
104) 6) dialog: It was a nice ceremony.
104) 9) dialog: It's a great party, Mom.   You look happy. Some joy is allowed to surface in her Mother's face.
104) 10) dialog: Thirty-five years and still in love, huh? Her Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.
104) 12) dialog: Of course not...
104) 17) dialog: I know.
104) 21) dialog: Sorry about that, but... I couldn't stand him doing that to you. I took it on...
104) 26) dialog: What's up with you?
104) 28) dialog: Oh. Well... let's pretend this is T.V. It's a show about a party. They look about the room.
104) 29) dialog: (as if it's a secret)
104) 32) dialog: Is too. And so is she. Look. See? Red tights under her dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her a drink with something in it.
104) 34) dialog: With stuff to make her sleep. He's a bad guy. The woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting into it.
104) 36) dialog: Watch. She'll fall down any minute. The boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his father. Larry puts the boy down near the door.
104) 43) dialog: What're you doing?
104) 45) text: Once the cops leave, we can really party. The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns back to Sharon.
105) 0) text: Sharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen, leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow them.
105) 4) dialog: Don't walk away. Okay? He acts as if he just noticed her.
105) 6) dialog: Is it working?     Do you need to check it? He absently touches the device.
105) 8) dialog: Dad... But the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper.
105) 11) dialog: Please? Please what?! Will you stop protecting him? You were always protecting him! Don't talk to your father. Don't bother your father! She turns to her dad.
105) 12) dialog: I'm going to bother you for one minute, Dad. Okay? Can you handle that? Larry advances on her.
105) 17) text: This isn't about you, Larry -- or you, either, Mom. This is between me and my father, so leave us alone for one goddam minute! She turns back to her father. SHARON
105) 20) dialog: Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome here?
105) 22) dialog: I want to know! (then, quieting)
105) 24) dialog: Do you... need to... check that again?
105) 26) dialog: What, Dad?   You feel like what?
105) 31) dialog: Well... you do. It's a shame you're going to miss knowing her. You're going to miss all that. And she leaves, brushing past Larry and her Mother.
106) 0) text: Sharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking   back tears. The party goes on around her, oblivious.    She stops on her way to the door because she sees the   video crew moving, hunting the next guest -- and she   makes a decision and walks toward them, stops in   the light, fac the camera.
106) 1) dialog: I'm next. As they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch.       Shar speaks over a torrent of emotions.
106) 2) dialog: (to camera)
106) 4) dialog: Y'know... being in this house reminds me of something.  I was about ten, I guess, and Larry and I were playing aliens -- remember, Lar? We're making a lot  of noise, and Dad comes home from work tired and pissed off...
106) 7) dialog: 
106) 8) dialog: We're yelling like mad, and Dad bursts into the room and says, what the hell are you doing? And I'm scared. I'm really scared.
106) 13) dialog: And I say, we're playing alien invasion, Dad, and he says, oh, yeah, I'll show you a damn invasion, and he picks me up, picks me up off the floor and throws me on the couch. I hit that couch and bounce off, and he grabs Larry and throws him on the couch, and then... then he starts making these monster sounds, and he says, we came to earth to kick ass, and I run at him and jump on him and he tosses me on the couch and then Larry, and we're laughing so hard I almost wet myself, and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping, and it was... it was great. It was great, and I'm never going to forget that. Never. And I miss that. I miss it. So I just... I wanted to tell you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks. That's all. (pause)
107) 0) text: Sharon exits    and starts to walk away. She sees Larry J look up from    his play. He smiles at her. She returns the smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on. she reaches    the gate, she notices something across the street that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and pleased.
107) 7) dialog: Me, too. In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house.
107) 9) dialog: They don't like me in there.
107) 11) dialog: That's a nice thing to say.
107) 14) dialog: It's not fair. The tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. The first time we've seen her cry.
107) 15) dialog: It's not fair. Things got better for them because of what I did. Things got better, and I'd still do it. I'd do it all over again. And it's not fair they shut me out. It's not.
107) 20) dialog: It's not fair. I was     19, and I didn't know what else    to do. I didn't know how else    to stop it. It's not fair I don't    have a family anymore.
108) 0) text: Sharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from crying. She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't move -- no longer sad, but drained now. He watches her. In a moment, he gets out of the car.
109) 0) text: Catch comes around to Sharon's window. She rolls the window down, concerned, wondering what he's doing. Is he leaving? But he reaches for her door and opens it and says without a fuss...
