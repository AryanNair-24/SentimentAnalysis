2) 3) dialog: Fuck off! George is not a `sexy' name. George is like what you name your teddy bear, not the name you wanna scream out during an orgasm.
2) 7) dialog: Name three.
2) 10) dialog: Besides Clooney. Too easy.
2) 14) dialog: Fine. That's one. Number two?
2) 19) dialog: Who's that?
2) 23) dialog: No way. Teddy bear.
2) 27) dialog: So what? Charlize Theron played that butt-fucking-ugly lesbo serial killer. Besides he's from another century.
2) 31) dialog: We're speaking present day. I mean, Jesus, Mortimer was probably a sexy name in some era.
2) 35) dialog: What are you? Fifty?
2) 40) dialog: Bush? Yeah. He's one hot mutherfucker. Just face it. There's no such thing as a sexy George.
2) 44) dialog: Fine. Don't come. I hate you.
5) 3) dialog: (Into the phone) PLEASE. Please. I'm begging you. I'll pay you.
6) 6) dialog: You're lying. You're a lying bitch and I hate you so much right now.
8) 3) dialog: (Into the phone) Why don't you just say it? You don't like my parents. You think they're hopelessly pathetic and devoid of souls and wish that you could live with normal people who didn't meet at a Star Trek convention!!
8) 9) dialog: Quick. Hurry and make up a lie.
8) 13) dialog: Liar. 6.
8) 19) dialog: With who?
8) 23) dialog: And neither do you, you selfish bitch!
8) 27) dialog: What's his name then?
8) 32) dialog: Stop stalling. You're totally trying to come up with a name. Just say it.
10) 4) dialog: George? What kind of a fucking name is George?
10) 9) dialog: If you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even I'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one. You had better fucking marry him, have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he's worth.
11) 3) dialog: (With her mouth full) You're not off the hook, you know. I want lurid details. This had better be the best date of your life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine.
15) 6) dialog: Details, bitch. Wait, first I need a scope of reference. Who would play him in the movie of your life?
15) 10) dialog: That works. Spill.
15) 14) dialog: Are you going to see him again?
15) 18) dialog: The whole weekend?
15) 23) dialog: Wait a minute. You didn't...
15) 27) dialog: 
15) 33) dialog: 
15) 38) dialog: Tell me everything and spare me the coquettish `just-the-tip' bullshit.
15) 42) dialog: I know you did it! I know you let him put it inside you, so just TELL
15) 47) dialog: The kind that does it or the kind that does it like a fucking porn star and then doesn't have the balls to talk about it?
16) 3) dialog: I want every perverted detail. NOW, bitch.
16) 8) dialog: You lost your virginity! Fucking finally! Now, you're a super-slut like me!
16) 12) dialog: There were people walking past. Whatever, this isn't about me. This is about YOU. What did you let him do?
16) 25) dialog: Was he big? Did it hurt?
16) 30) dialog: What the fuck are you looking at, Marianne?
22) 10) dialog: What the fuck is a meerkat anyway?
22) 14) dialog: I think I speak for all of the female students and faculty - and maybe a couple of males - when I say that I liked Todd much better when he was shirtless. I actually looked forward to these disturbing displays of -- what do they call it?
22) 18) dialog: Yeah. That's it. 15.
22) 23) dialog: Ha! What are those people called again? The ones that dress up like stuffed animals when they do it?
22) 28) dialog: Shhh. Don't let Marianne hear you say that word. The last thing we need is McCarthyism at Barbara Bush.
22) 32) dialog: True. (Beat.) Yeah, I'd totally fuck Meerkat Todd.
32) 3) dialog: Please tell me the rumors are true.
32) 7) dialog: Not that one. The one where you called Nina Howell a cunt and then socked her in the nose.
32) 12) dialog: Yeah. Like the exact moment you turned into such a BAD ASS? I think I'm in LOVE with you.
32) 16) dialog: Please tell me you at least left a mark on that scrunched-up face of hers. POW! The cunt goes down for the count!
32) 24) dialog: Please. It's my only perk. Trust me.
49) 4) dialog: I have many questions, obviously.
49) 12) dialog: Now is not the time to be cute.
49) 17) dialog: Olive, stop it. This is serious. Did you really bang Brandon last night at Melanie Dipshit's party?
49) 22) dialog: That's what EVERYONE is saying.
49) 26) dialog: Does this mean you guys are dating?
49) 32) dialog: Just because you lost your virginity doesn't mean you can go around screwing everybody!
49) 37) dialog: You're getting a reputation.
49) 41) dialog: Please forgive my rectitude, but I think that a best friend's duty is to let her know that everyone - and I do mean everyone - is calling her a cum dumpster.
49) 45) dialog: Look, baby, I call a spade a spade.
49) 50) dialog: I didn't want to believe it, but I guess it's true. You're a fucktart. 55.
49) 55) dialog: Oh yeah. I totally want to lose my virginity to one of -- (As if it was a disease) -- your brother's friends and then be the first for a fairy, while everyone listens outside! What is wrong with you? Does sex mean anything to you?
84) 10) dialog: My sentiments exactly...
102) 10) dialog: Me too. You guys fucking rock. 105.
102) 19) dialog: But isn't that just implying the same word?
102) 25) dialog: Yay! It's time for Meerkat Todd.
