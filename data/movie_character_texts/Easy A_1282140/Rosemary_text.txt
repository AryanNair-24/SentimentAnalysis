25) 16) dialog: What's the rumor mill turning out these days?
25) 21) dialog: Don't forget your brother's staying here next weekend.
25) 25) dialog: They're fumigating the dorms. And thank God for that. Last time I was there, I saw three cockroaches.
25) 30) dialog: Sorry, hon.
33) 10) dialog: (More curious than angry) What did you say?
33) 24) dialog: T? That's an odd one. Is this one of those new curse words?
33) 27) dialog: Was it -- ?
33) 32) dialog: Yeah. Neither do I.
33) 39) dialog: Well, I'm stumped. Whisper it in my ear.
33) 44) dialog: Oo! Oo! Spell it with your peas! 30.
33) 60) dialog: Good, sweetheart.
33) 63) dialog: Oh, I know what it is!

33) 77) dialog: 
33) 82) dialog: Of what?
33) 125) dialog: Because, pumpkin, of our three darling children, we love her best. (Erupting into laughter) Just kidding! Now eat your dinner.
37) 5) dialog: 
37) 10) dialog: Just kidding! Come on in.
37) 13) dialog: Olive, sweetie, there's a young man here to see you. He said something about asking for your hand in marriage.
48) 6) dialog: That kid from the other night just dropped this off for you.
48) 11) dialog: He seems like a nice boy... Gay...
48) 16) dialog: I dated a homosexual in high school.
48) 20) dialog: I just wanted to tell you that if you want to date a gay boy, it might be hard on your father and I, at first. But we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite-sex partner.
101) 5) dialog: I had a similar situation when I was your age.
101) 10) dialog: Yes. I had a horrible reputation and people said awful things about me. But it was true. I was a slut.

101) 20) dialog: Well! It was a different time. 103.
101) 25) dialog: I did. I got around. Before I met your father, I was a garden variety floozy.
101) 29) dialog: Because I endured a similar lynching because of a certain dalliance.
101) 33) dialog: Wanna bet? It was her mother.
101) 37) dialog: Yep. Don Bryant and I got caught in a very compromising position in the locker room during a basketball game.
101) 41) dialog: He wasn't back then. He was actually pretty handsome. All I'm saying is that MAYBE the reason that Bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me.
101) 45) dialog: There's something else you should know. This is hard to say but -- Don Bryant is your father. Marianne is your sister. 104.
101) 49) dialog: Kidding!! Well, about the sister thing, but not about the Don thing. That happened. Actually that happened a couple of times before we got caught.
101) 54) dialog: No, you're not, Olive. You're wonderful. And you're going to handle this the same way that I did. With an incontrovertible sense of humor.
