35) 25) dialog: Really, really amazing. Don't know if you heard, but according to my locker, I'm a `power bottom.'
35) 29) dialog: Yeah, only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing `turd burglar' off. Which, if you think about it, really contradicts the previous label.
35) 34) dialog: But, of course, I'm in detention.

35) 51) dialog: Gold star for you, Nancy Drew.
35) 56) dialog: Oh good. I'll come back when I'm twenty seven for my redo.
35) 61) dialog: That'll be the day. (Beat.) Judging from the new look you're sporting, I'm not the only one in a transformative stage. `Sup with the whore couture?
35) 66) dialog: As a matter of fact I did hear that. I heard you banged a guy twice your age.
35) 70) dialog: Also heard he gave you crabs.
35) 75) dialog: Tell me about it.
35) 79) dialog: So, you started the rumor?
35) 83) dialog: But you're perpetuating it. That's fucked up.
35) 88) dialog: It's true. There's only one thing worse than these tabloid-chasing celebutantes with their vapid minds and their immoral souls and that's the people who want to be like them.
35) 92) dialog: No, you just want everyone else to think you are.
35) 96) dialog: You're saying I should pretend to be straight, so people will like me? What a novel idea. You should do seminars. Oh, wait a minute, I forgot... In high school,
35) 105) dialog: There are some of us, though, that want to just blend in to the crowd.
35) 109) dialog: I can't decide if you're a genius or a lunatic.
35) 114) dialog: Funny. I always thought teen angst and apathy went hand in hand. 38.
35) 120) dialog: What? Pretending to be a whore? For a virgin, I'm impressed. How about me? Could I pass as straight?
35) 124) dialog: I prefer the term `turd burglar.'
35) 129) dialog: But you know that we would never do that.
36) 35) dialog: It's Brandon. 40.
37) 3) dialog: Hi. Is there an Olive here?
37) 8) dialog: Sorry, I must have gotten the address wrong.
38) 9) dialog: 
38) 13) dialog: I mean, like -- Do you want to be my girlfriend?
38) 17) dialog: True. But you said I should pretend to be straight.
38) 21) dialog: You're not really my type either.
38) 25) dialog: Okay. Well, do you wanna have sex with me?
38) 32) dialog: No, I know what you were saying. I should play it straight until I get out of this hell and then I can be whoever I want to be. No, I got that.
38) 41) dialog: So, you're saying I shouldn't really have sex. I should just say I had sex with someone. A girl.
38) 48) dialog: Think about it. We could help each other out. You want to maintain this floozy facade. I want to not get my face pummelled weekly.
38) 52) dialog: All it would take is one good imaginary fuck and you'd be saving the bone structure of my face. Think of how happy my parents would be!
38) 56) dialog: Who would believe me?
38) 62) dialog: I'll pay you. I can pay you whatever you want.
38) 67) dialog: Whores aren't discerning, Olive. And just think - you'll OFFICIALLY be a hooker with a heart of gold!
38) 71) dialog: I insist.
38) 75) dialog: (His voice cracking with
