34) 1) dialog: Darnell, I've reviewed your placement  test and I'm afraid you failed to  meet our entrance requirements in  two areas.
34) 3) dialog: No. It means you're going to have to  take some remedial classes, what we  call "zero level" courses.  Specifically Math 0 and English 0.
34) 5) dialog: You won't get college credit for  them, but they will help you prepare  to take the Placement Test again at  the end of the quarter. If you pass  at that time you'll be able to  officially enter the university and  take college level courses. You'll  still be able to take an American  History survey course, but it won't  count on your record until you pass  the Placement Test. But first things  first. To start, I'm approving a  tutor for you.
34) 7) dialog: Any tutor. And yes you do.
