You’re going to see me less and less. When you do, I’‘1l be distracted, I’1l be upset, I'll be playing things in my mind. And you're going to just grow to resent me. At a certain point, you’1ll tell me to ease up on the drumming, to spend more time with you. And I won’t be able to. And I’11 start to resent you for even asking me that. I’1l feel like you’re dragging me down, you'll feel like you don’t matter -- and before long, we’ll hate each other. So I think we should just cut it off now, cleanly, for those reasons. A beat.
