Fletcher’s right arm moves, just a hair, and the band sta fast, dazzling. Andrew watches -- in awe. The band’s play STUDIO BAND EAVESDROP CHART, and the sound is so full, so precise, so commanding. Nothing like Nassau. And suddenly -- Fletcher TURNS AROUND. His eyes meet Andr Andrew ducks out of view -- shit -- -- and hurries away.
11) 3) dialog: Come in. A door opens -- the black gives way -- and we see, seated a polished mahogany desk, Fletcher. He looks as imposing and as well-dressed -- as ever. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Hey, Andrew! I guess Sophie found you? Andrew is taken aback. Fletcher remembers his first name?
11) 5) dialog: Come in, come in, close the door... Fletcher rises to greet Andrew, as Andrew closes the door Pink (9/10/2013) 13 FLETCHER (CONT’D) I like to chat with students coming in and going out. I hear you’re going out? Andrew looks surprised by the warmth in Fletcher’s voice.
11) 7) dialog: Terrific. Columbia’s a terrific school. Did something precipitate this?
11) 9) dialog: Bravo. (as he starts to head back toward his desk--) Too many students clamp down on their “pursuits” like leeches. (sits atop his desk) Hobbies they picked up in their teens, and for what? Take a seat.
11) 11) dialog: What were you then? Twelve?
11) 13) dialog: Oh. Well, kids start swimming when they’re six, doesn’t mean they’re Michael Phelps. It’s a hobby, never anything you consider going all the way with. Am I right?
11) 15) dialog: Well, kids want anything. I wanted to be a nanny. Thank God those I trusted talked me out of it. Good to listen to advice.
11) 17) dialog: --good to get outside perspectives. So long as they don’t have ulterior motives, I’'d listen to what the people you trust tell you. Andrew nods. But that phrase seems to echo. Ulterior moti Fletcher hops down from the desk and makes his way to the couch. FLETCHER (CONT’D) So what's the passion you've chosen to pursue at Columbia, then?
11) 19) dialog: Ah. Well that’s ok. You’re young. Most people, it takes years for them to find their calling. My father, for instance -- he had no idea what he wanted at your age. He tried a lot of things, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Took him years before he realized his dream was insurance. That was his passion. The cubicle, the coffee breaks, the dry wall. He lets this simmer for a beat. Then-- FLETCHER (CONT’D) I’m sure you'll find your calling as well. He rises back up. A moment of silence. FLETCHER (CONT’D) I guess that’s it, then. Any questions? He notices Andrew looking at a photo on the wall. He takes standing drift to walls... JVC Jazz Pink (9/10/2013) 15 FLETCHER (CONT’D) That’s Sean Casey. Graduated three years ago.

Laszlo Polgar, Hungarian psychologist, declares in 1967 that talent is all about conditioning. Says he can make his kids, whoever they are, the best in the world at something. What that something is he'll decide. He’s a lousy chess player but he picks chess because it’s objective. Goes around looking for a wife, finds one who agrees to his experiment. Starts having kids: Susan, Sofia and Judit. Gets them practicing before they can even talk. These weren’t kids who were sitting and smelling the roses. These were kids who were going to leave an actual mark on the world. Who was the top female player by 1984? Susan. Who played the eight-straight-wins “Miracle of Rome” in 1989? Sofia. And who is universally considered the greatest female chess player of all time? Judit. a breath. Smiles. We linger for a second on Andrew, in place, taking it all in.

FLETCHER (CONT’D) Which is why I’m sure you’1l be great at whatever you set your mind to at Columbia. (puts his arm around Andrew, starts escorting him toward the door--) It was a pleasure chatting, Andrew, now--
11) 23) dialog: Well that’s worrisome. I’m sure you had good reason to make your decision.
11) 25) dialog: No need to do that. First instincts are best.
11) 27) dialog: I’m not sure your first instinct is right, then. Why don’t you give it some more thought, and in the meantime... (reaches the door; about to close--) ---make sure your double-time swing is ready by Monday’s Nassau Band. He closes the door. WE LINGER on Andrew. A spark has been

His excitement visible, he- FLETCHER (CONT’D) Other drums. Ryan freezes. Andrew is stuck in place for a moment. Then eyes wide -- is this really happening? -- he rises and approaches the doorway... There, Fletcher hands him an OR PAPER SLIP. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Give this to Admin for rescheduling. We meet 6am to lpm every day. Room B16. And with that, he EXITS.

Total silence. Then -- the slightest move of Fletcher's finger, and the band begins WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL CARL #1. The chart’s named “Whiplash” for a reason. It’s fast, frenetic, 7/4 time. T fast, with this many polyrhythms, it’s impossibly hard.

FLETCHER (CONT’D) Five-six-seven-- The band plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL CARL #2. Intense, visceral. Fletcher paces back and forth, eyeing players as they play. He’s got fox’s ears, hawk’s eyes. E sinew of his body is focused. Andrew watches, awed, scare completely overwhelmed.
20) 15) dialog: Stop! The band comes to a halt. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Now this one upsets me. We have an out-of- tune player. Before I go any further, does that player want to do the right thing and reveal himself? (silence) Ok. Maybe a bug flew in my ear. Bar 115. Five-six-and-- He cues the BAND with his hand, then cuts them off. Pink (9/10/2013) 26 FLETCHER (CONT’D) No, I guess my ears are clean because we most definitely have an out-of-tune player. Whoever it is, this is your last chance. (paces back and forth, slowly) Either you know you are out of tune, and are therefore deliberately sabotaging my band; or you do not know you’re out of tune -- which I’m afraid is even worse. Nothing. The players avert his gaze. All terrified... FLETCHER (CONT’D) Reeds. Five-six-and-- (they play, he cuts them off) Bones. Five-six-and-- (they play, he cuts them off) Ahhhh, he’s here. Silence. He eyes the TROMBONISTS. Lands on one, METZ. Ove Been picked on his whole life. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Tell me it’s not you, Elmer Fudd. Metz sits there, trembling. On the brink of tears. FLETCHER (CONT’D) It’s ok. Play. (Metz does so, Fletcher stops him, leans in, whispers--) Do you think you’re out of tune? Metz, terrified, looks down at the floor. FLETCHER (CONT’D) There’s no fucking Mars Bar down there. Look at me. Do you think you're out of tune?
20) 17) dialog: Then why the FUCK didn’t you say so?!? Silence. It’s the first time we’ve heard Fletcher really His voice is booming, louder than one would have thought. FLETCHER (CONT’D) I’ve been carrying your fat ass for too long, Metz. (MORE)

Stein, congratulations, you are now fourth-chair trombone. Metz -- get the fuck out. Still trembling, tears bubbling out, Metz picks up his trombone and walks to the door. Andrew watches -- shocked Once the door closes-- FLETCHER (CONT’D) For the record, Metz was not out of tune. You were, Wallach. But Metz didn’t know it. And that’s bad enough.
20) 19) text: And then -- he looks straight at Andrew. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Alright, take ten. When we get back -- the squeaker’s on. Andrew's face goes ghost-white.

22) 3) dialog: Dragging. Claps again. Andrew plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL ANDREW #3, expecting another stop -- but it doesn’t come. Fletcher nods, as though now satisfied, then slowly turns around. Puts his hand on a spare chair. Looks like he’s about to sit down, when... like a flash of lightning he WHIPS up the chair and HURLS it straight at Andrew’s head.

41) 5) dialog: Now, just as was the case with you, I stumbled on a kid practicing his double- time swing the other night. I’d like to give him a shot. Before Andrew can register, let alone ask “Who?”--
41) 7) dialog: Perfect timing! Join us, Connolly. (Ryan heads over, smiling) You two know each other, don’t you?
41) 9) dialog: Now, Connolly, I’ve made Andrew a temporary core-- (Andrew’s eyes shoot up at the word “temporary” ) --but we've got the competition this weekend and I want to make sure the new chart’s in good shape. Ryan nods, reaches into his backpack. And, to Andrew's sh pulls out the “new chart”. CARAVAN.
41) 11) dialog: (as though he can read his mind) I gave it to him this morning, Neiman. Now, all I want to do is test out the part. Neiman, if you wouldn’t mind, could we take it from the top with just you? Andrew tries to keep calm. Goes to the drums, lays out th chart. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Don’t worry, I don’t care about hits. That’1l be tonight. For now, just tempo. Andrew nods. Takes a deep breath. Looks at the tempo nota “330”. Another breath. Ok... I've got this... Fletcher CL Andrew BEGINS. FLETCHER (CONT’D) No... That’s not quite my tempo...
41) 13) dialog: Let’s see if Connolly can do it, ok? Beat. Andrew looks at Ryan. Heart pounding, he switches w him. Fletcher CLAPS. Ryan BEGINS. And he plays perfectly.
41) 14) dialog: Connolly -- that was excellent. See, this is the beauty of Studio Band. You come in an alternate -- but a minute later, you could be the new core. Andrew's eyes widen again. 53 Pink (9/10/2013) 58

41) 20) dialog: Now is not the time, I I can play that part, you swear to God-- know I can--

It’s CASEY’S SONG and it’s a tender sound, full of melancholy... For a few seconds, Fletcher doesn’t say a word. His thoug seem to be drifting. Then, hesitant, as the music plays.. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Six years ago...I saw a kid practicing scales in a band room here. He'd started at Shaffer with a lot of hope, but the truth was he’d barely squeaked in and he was struggling. Everyone on the faculty told him: “This isn’t for you.” But they didn’t see what I saw... (his voice croaking again, emotional, ) ...this...this scared, skinny kid cursing himself ‘cause he couldn’t get his scales right... I saw a drive in him... (MORE)

A year later, he was first. That’s who you’re hearing now. (then, ) His name was Sean Casey. The name catches Andrew’s attention. The trumpeter Fletch mentioned to him... And the word “was”... FLETCHER (CONT’D) I found out this morning...that Sean died. He died in a car accident yesterday... (takes a moment, is having trouble speaking) I just wanted you guys to know that... He was... Sean was a... (and, almost dissolving into tears on these next words) -.-beautiful player... (breathes in, collects himself) I just thought you all should know. Beat. He leans back down and turns off the CD. Silence. FLETCHER (CONT’D) (another moment; then, still shaky--) “Caravan”. From bar 142, please.

Dismayed, Andrew gets off, Carl gets on, Fletcher CLAPS him off -- and then, SLAMMING his fist down on his table, the barely suppresse grief giving way now to terrifying, full-out rage--
45) 8) dialog: Mother-FUCKER! ! ! Carl JUMPS. The band goes silent. Fletcher glares at his drummers, eyes so heated they could burn holes into you.

Fletcher CLAPS, stops yet again-- FLETCHER (CONT’D) Not my FUCKING tempo! !!! He turns to the rest of the band. Rubs his eyes, breathes then, trying to keep calm but his face already beet-red.. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Ok... Sorry about this, gang, hate to put you through it. But rest your arms, put aside your instruments, if you need to take a dump do it now, ‘cause I am going to go for as long as it takes until I find a drummer who can play in time. (to the drummers--) You hear me talking, cocksuckers? You'd better start shitting me perfect 400’s. Connolly. You first. Get on the kit.

Andrew -- whole body shaking, had been playing for half a hour straight -- gets off the kit, struggling for breath, hands coated with torn blisters and blood. Fletcher's rag unlike anything we’ve seen from him: pained, vengeful... Carl gets on the kit. Fletcher CLAPS. The clock: 11:06. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Well what do we have here? Gay Pride himself. This is not a Sinead O’Connor concert, Tanner. I am sorry to inform you we will not be serving Baked Alaska and Cosmopolitans tonight. Now why don’t you try playing faster than you give fucking hand jobs?? One! One! One! One! OFF THE

58) 15) dialog: 
58) 18) dialog: Earned? You've never earned a thing. The only reason you're a fucking core is because you misplaced a folder. The only reason you’re in Studio Band is because I told you what I’d be asking for in Nassau.
58) 22) dialog: You realize I can cut you anytime I feel.
58) 24) dialog: Try me you weasel. At 5:30, that’s in eleven minutes, my band is on-stage. You're not there with your own sticks, or you show up and make a single mistake -- a single one -- and I’1l send you back to Nassau Band to turn pages until you graduate or drop out. For extra kicks, I'll spread the word on just how you became a Studio Band core, and by the time my sewing circle is done you'll make your dad look like a success story.

And that RINGING -- growing and growing, drowning out everything else... He looks at the SHEET MUSIC, suddenly lost... The horns b out a hit -- but Andrew isn’t on it. Fuck. Launches into fill -- and hits the crash at the wrong time. Fletcher stares at him. The look says it all: it’s over. Andrew keeps fighting. Another missed hit, then a missed signature change, the beat falling apart beneath his feet chaos, and then, finally, the sign of death -- Andrew STO 75 76 78 Pink (9/10/2013) 716 Almost immediately, the rest of the band grinds to a halt a horrible sound, like a car screeching, nails on a chalk Fletcher stands in place, eyes on Andrew. In fact, all ey on Andrew. The theater is dead-silent. Disbelief everywhe Calmly, Fletcher approaches Andrew and whispers one last FLETCHER (CONT’D) You're done. Then he turns around. Andrew start shaking, his eyes brim -- and, suddenly, something takes over inside. Almost des himself, he RISES -- and KICKS OVER THE DRUMS. Cymbals CRASH to the wooden stage-floor like bombs. Andre CHARGES forward -- and, just as Fletcher turns to him, TA the man to the ground... Andrew goes absolutely batshit crazy on Fletcher, murder eyes... Raises his fists, about to POUND into Fletcher's when SECURITY GUARDS yank him off, pulling him away in a Torn from his target, Andrew breaks down into TEARS. Ever thing inside him spilling out like water. Fletcher, stunn uninjured, gets back on his feet. His shirt drips with bl not his own, but Andrew’s. A SECURITY GUARD rushes onto t scene, and Andrew, kicking and screaming, is DRAGGED OFF. We linger inside the theater. A hush over the audience, t players and their instruments.

69) 1) dialog: So what are you up to these days, Andrew?
69) 4) dialog: You shouldn’t be. A player’s got to be willing to fight. Andrew looks at him. FLETCHER (CONT’D) You played with a broken bone. After crashing a car. That’s insane.
69) 6) dialog: Good thing you’re not in that place anymore. A beat. Then -- Fletcher seems distracted. By people CLAP ALONG to the band... FLETCHER (CONT’D) Have you ever noticed it’s never the people with rhythm who clap along? He starts CLAPPING loudly, in the proper tempo. Leans ove the table next to his, where a COUPLE is clapping off-bea starts CLAPPING in their faces. Then sits back down.
69) 7) dialog: I don’t know if you know... I don’t teach anymore.
69) 9) dialog: -..No, not exactly. He looks at Andrew. A moment of tension. Does he know...? Pink (9/10/2013) 86 FLETCHER (CONT’D) A couple parents got a kid from Sean Casey's year... I don’t know who, I think maybe a bassist... They got him to say a few things about me... That much I know... (Andrew tries to hide his relief) Though why anyone would have anything but honey and sugar to say about me is a mystery. Andrew laughs. Seems the mood has lightened. FLETCHER (CONT’D) That’s a good laugh, huh?
69) 11) dialog: No, it’s ok -- I know I’ve made some enemies. Maybe I seem to think my style is normal, but believe me, I don’t. A moment. Fletcher finally takes a sip of his drink. FLETCHER (CONT’D) I’m conducting some, though. They’re bringing back the JVC Fest this year, got me opening with a pro band in two weeks.
69) 13) dialog: (earns) It’s ok... Then, looking off for a moment-- FLETCHER (CONT’D) The truth is I don’t think people understand what it is I did at Shaffer. I wasn’t there to conduct. Any idiot can move his hands and keep people in tempo. No, it’s about pushing people beyond what's expected of them. And I believe that is a necessity. Because without it you’re depriving the world of its next Armstrong. Its next Parker. (pause) Why did Charlie Parker become Charlie Parker, Andrew? Pink (9/10/2013) 87 Beat. Andrew is surprised. He’s told this story himself.
69) 15) dialog: Exactly. Young kid, pretty good on the sax, goes up to play his solo ina cutting session, fucks up -- and Jones comes this close to slicing his head off for it. He’s laughed off-stage. Cries himself to sleep that night. But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And practices and practices. With one goal in mind: that he never ever be laughed off-stage again. A year later he goes back to the Reno, and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world had ever heard.
69) 16) text: Andrew smiles. Nods. Finally -- unlike his uncles, his co even his father -- someone who gets it. FLETCHER (CONT’D) Now imagine if Jones had just patted young Charlie on the head and said “Good job.” Charlie would've said to himself, “Well, shit, I did do a good job,” and that'd be that. No Bird. Tragedy, right? Except that’s just what people today want. The Shaffer Conservatories of the world, they want sugar. You don’t even say “cutting session” anymore, do you? No, you say “jam session”. What the fuck kind of word is that? Jam session? It’s a cutting session, Andrew, this isn’t fucking Smucker’s. It’s about weeding out the best from the worst so that the worst become better than the best. (beat) I mean look around you. $25 drinks, mood lighting, a little shrimp cocktail to go with your Coltrane. And people wonder why jazz is dying. (then, ) Take it from me, and every Starbucks jazz album only proves my point. There are no two words more harmful in the entire English language than “good job”. Beat. He leans back. Lets his words linger. Andrew thinks Pink (9/10/2013) 88
69) 18) dialog: No. Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged. Andrew takes this in. A moment...
69) 20) dialog: Not really. Here and there... The playing never interested me. I never wanted to be Charlie Parker. I wanted to be the man who made Charlie Parker. The man who discovered some scrawny kid, pushed him, prodded him, shaped him into something great -- and then said to the world, “Check this out. The best motherfucking solo you've ever heard.”
69) 22) dialog: Sean... Sean was a sweet kid... And with all those idiots saying “This isn’t for you”, Sean did something great. Very few people ever get that chance... Looks off. Looks at the musicians on-stage... FLETCHER (CONT’D) But no... Not Sean Casey. (then, as he thinks about this, ) The truth is I don’t know if I ever had a Charlie Parker... (and then, ) But I tried. And that’s more than most people can say, Andrew. I tried. And even if I never find one, I will never apologize for trying. 94 Pink (9/10/2013) 89 He’s silent. A look of disappointment. Then, he points to the PIANIST on-stage... FLETCHER (CONT’D) He’s a beautiful player, isn’t he?

70) 4) dialog: I’m using the Studio Band playlist. “Whiplash”, “Caravan”. I need a replacement who already knows those charts inside out. Andrew looks at him. You can’t be serious...
70) 6) dialog: What about him? All he was was your incentive.
70) 10) dialog: He switched to pre-med. (and with a hint of a smile) I think he got discouraged. Andrew is speechless now. Is this really happening? FLETCHER (CONT’D) We're rehearsing next Tuesday. Why don’t you take the weekend to think about it? Andrew takes it all in. WE PUSH in on him, processing... slowly but surely, his shock and uncertainty harden befor eyes -- into resolution... This is something to seize on.

He’s standing right in front of CARNEGIE HALL. A giant ba hangs above the main steps: “JVC IN NYC: JAZZ!" And, keep out of sight -- -- Fletcher.
