Tom stands the doorway a long beat, then sits in his chair. A long beat as the family eats. Tom looks around at his family, who don’t return his look, He closes his eyes and fights back the tears. Sarah looks around the table, at h mother and brother, then her father. She’s thinking hard. Sarah gets up and walks over to the counter and picks up plate and some silverware and puts them in front of her father, her face very straight. Tom looks at her, his eye wet, and smiles. She shoots him an uncertain smile, then back to her seat. Jack, chewing his dinner, looks at the serving plate in t middle of the table. He swallows, then pushes the plate o in front of his father, not making eye contact. Tom smile gratitude. He looks across the table at Edie, who stares intently at food in front of her. After a lang beat, she looks up at her husband, her face impassive. He looks back, no idea what she‘s thinking, no idea what the future holds. But he sees something in her eyes, and for now, that’s enough. There's hope.
