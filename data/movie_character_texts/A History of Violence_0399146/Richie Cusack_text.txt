Richie whips out a gun and points it at Joey’s head. Joey freezes. RICHIE (cont'd) Oh, yeah. There were five. Richie stands up, gun still pointed. RICHTE (cont‘d) I knew you'd come, Didn‘t think you'd make it this far, though. I was hoping for a little less bloodshed, Joey. Jesus, you're good with the killing, aren’t you? Joey glares at him. RICHIE (cont’d} Why do you think that is? You think it's genetic? You think your old man was some kind of killer? Or is it just chance?

Without warning, Joey whips his head to the left, causing Richie’s gun to slide forward, past his head. Richie stag forward, and grunts in surprise. The gun goes off, but Jo knocks it out of his hand with his free hand. Richie slowly looks down and sees Joey‘s other hand - it’ wrapped around the knife sticking into Richie’s belly. Ri staggers back, clutching the knife, blood gushing. Joey calmly pulls out one of his guns and points it at Richie.
