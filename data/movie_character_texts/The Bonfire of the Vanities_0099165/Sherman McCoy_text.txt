46) 25) dialog: I hope not.   God, Maria, it looks like you.
46) 27) dialog: Where are you going?

59) 10) dialog: It means I want to take the initiative. I want to go to the police with Maria -- Mrs. Ruskin -- and just tell them exactly what happened. I mean, I don't know about the law, but I feel morally certain that we did what was right -- in the situation we were in. And I don't see...
59) 12) dialog: But why?

62) 64) dialog: By the police, I imagine.
62) 66) dialog: I don't think it will be too bad. My lawyer -- if you can call him that -- has received assurances that it will all be handled in an orderly fashion.
62) 68) dialog: Yes.   Well.   You have a point.
62) 70) dialog: The other guy has come forward. He says I was driving the car. I'm going to be arrested tomorrow morning. I need to know from you ... I mean, what do you want me to say?
