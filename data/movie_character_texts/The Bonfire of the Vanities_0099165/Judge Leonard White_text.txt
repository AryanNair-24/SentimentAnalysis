29) 1) dialog: Mr. Sonenberg!?!
29) 3) dialog: Where is Mister Son-nenberg?
29) 7) dialog: Where the hell is Mister Son-nen-berg!!!
29) 10) dialog: Alright, Mr. Lockwood, you sit down. And if and when your lawyer deigns to favor us with his presence...
29) 14) dialog: Mr. Lockwood...
29) 16) dialog: Nobody wants to go to trial, Mr. Lockwood.
29) 18) dialog: Listen, you son of a bitch. You're a nice boy, you're young, you got a lot going for you. Try to understand me. We got 7,000 felony indictments in the Bronx every year. And we got room for 650 trials. And you are not going to be one of them.
29) 23) dialog: You go sit down, that's what you go do! And when your asshole lawyer shows up, you're gonna take whatever plea bargain we give you and you're gonna kiss my ass and thank me that I didn't put you away for twenty-five years. Which, if this case ever did come to trial is exactly what you would get. Now get out of my face.
29) 33) dialog: This case was dismissed three weeks ago.
29) 38) dialog: What is this case doing here?
29) 40) dialog: Who the hell are you?
29) 42) dialog: You're new here, Mr. Kramer. Let me explain something to you. This case is what we call a piece of shit. Which means, loosely translated, that you have no evidence.
29) 44) dialog: I know who the district attorney is. I know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale.
29) 46) dialog: Because this is an election year. Because ninety-nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety-nine percent don't even speak English. But they do vote.
29) 50) dialog: So Mr. Weiss, your boss, the District Attorney -- who dreams every night that someday he is going to be mayor of New York City -- what he needs is a white man. He needs to find him, book him, and throw him in jail. Then he looks good to everybody. The press likes it, the voters like it, even your mother will like it. You follow me now, Mr. Kramer?
29) 52) dialog: So you go tell your boss, the district attorney, Captain Ahab Weiss that I know he's out there looking for the great white defendent... but Mr. Williams over there is not it.
68) 5) dialog: Mr. McCoy, you know the charges that are being brought against you.
68) 7) dialog: We want to know how you plead to the charges.
68) 9) dialog: You're what?
68) 20) dialog: Bail has been set at $10,000...
68) 30) dialog: (bangs the gavel) Quiet! Where the hell do you think you are?!
68) 33) dialog: If your office has information bearing upon the bail status of this case, I instruct you to make a formal application. Until then, I am releasing Mr. McCoy under a bond in the amount of $10,000. Now get this side show out of my court.
68) 35) dialog: Mr. Kramer, I have spoken.
68) 37) dialog: Mr. Kramer...
68) 41) dialog: Kindly behoove me no ill-behooves!!!
68) 43) dialog: Mr. Kramer, the court directs you to shut up!!!
100) 26) dialog: What in hell...?!
100) 37) dialog: Whose tape is this, Mr. McCoy?
100) 41) dialog: Shut up, Mr. Kramer. Mr. McCoy, I remind you that you are still under oath. Now, did you record this conversation?
100) 43) dialog: Get out of my face. All of you.
100) 45) dialog: I want some fucking order in here!
100) 48) dialog: (screaming) So you insist on testing the will of this court!!!! Now you shut up and sit down!! All of you! Very well. In the case of the People versus Sherman McCoy, the Grand Jury has returned an indictment. Based on the evidence contained in this recording... (holds up the tape) ... and pursuant to my authority to supervise the Grand Jury's proceedings...
100) 52) dialog: ... I am ordering the indictment dismissed in the interests of justice, without prejudice and with leave to re-present by the District Attorney.
100) 57) dialog: Justice! You want justice?!   I'll give you justice!
100) 60) dialog: You dare call me a racist! Well, I say to you, you -- a mob who dares to come into these walls -- I say to you, what does it matter ... the color of a man's skin? If witnesses perjure themselves... and a prosecutor, a sworn officer of the court, enlists the perjurers ... and a district attorney throws a man to the mob and lawyers carve up that man for his money... and men of the cloth, men of God take the prime cuts! Now you tell me -- IS THAT JUSTICE?!
