60) 17) dialog: Why are we having this conversation?
60) 19) text: Judy sits down and thinks.

75) 8) dialog: You betrayed us, Sherman. Me. Campbell. Even yourself. On the other hand, I am going to chair the museum benefit thanks to you and your escapades on the public airways. What can I say? Life goes on. I can only make the best of an absolutely appalling situation and carry on.
75) 10) dialog: I suppose I can forgive   anything, but not television. I'm    leaving you, Sherman. After the    party. Now if you'll excuse me,   we have guests.
