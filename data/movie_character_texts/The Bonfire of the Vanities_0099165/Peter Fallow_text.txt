1) 3) dialog: Yes. We're getting closer. Can you feel it. Can you see it? The heat. The brilliance. Moving fast into the heart of it. Buzz. Buzz. Can you feel the buzz? The city is pulling you in. The city of light. The city of diabolical promise. The city of answered prayers.
3) 0) text: pulls up. A male and female aide -- both carrying walkie-talkies -- rush to open the door. They pry PETER FALLOW from the back seat. He is wearing a tuxedo and dark glasses. He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful beyond his means. CONTINUE IN ONE SHOT as...
4) 1) dialog: ... And it begins on a rainy night, only a few months ago.
4) 6) dialog: Our hero, Sherman McCoy, was about to make a simple phone call. And despite the existence of eleven telephones and seven different lines in the fourteen rooms of his six million dollar plus apartment, this was a phone call he could not make at home.
7) 25) dialog: She was right, of course. And Sherman knew it. Christ. How could he have been so stupid? A simple phone call...
7) 29) dialog: The next morning, Judy's words were still ringing in his ears. Cheap. Rotten. And a liar. Alright. But was it really his fault. In a way she had brought it on herself, hadn't she? He intercepts Campbell at the foot of the stairs.
7) 35) dialog: On the lifecycle again. You see? Like all those other women she spends so much time with. So drawn, so pale. You could see lamplight through their bones... As Sherman picks up his briefcase and a copy of the newspaper, Campbell opens the door and rings for the elevator.

8) 12) dialog: Sherman was a master of the universe. He deserved better.
10) 28) dialog: The roar enveloped him. Music to his ears. The sound of educated young white men baying for money on the bond market. Six hundred million in his hands. Six million off the top for Pierce &amp; Pierce. One point seven million for Sherman. All in a day's work. He was there. At the top -- impervious, untouchable, insulated by wealth and power. A great height from which to view the rest of the poor world. A great height from which to fall.
33) 12) dialog: She knew how to hurt a guy. No. He was nothing like his father. His father, the lion of Dunning, Sponget and Leach. His father, who took the subway to work every day of his life. His father, who still believed in principals and ethics, whose repeated lessons concerning duty, debt and responsibility had whistled through his son's head. No. Sherman McCoy was nothing like his father.
35) 2) dialog: Of course, up to this point in our story, I was blissfully ignorant. I had no idea of the storm that was gathering. Never even heard of Sherman McCoy. Hadn't the faintest notion that soon his name would be inexorably tied to mine. That his fate would be inextricably bound to my own destiny.
35) 4) dialog: I had my own problems. And I simply had no idea that Sherman McCoy was the solution I was looking for.

35) 11) dialog: Enchante.   We're a little crowded.

35) 17) text: Peter sits in a chair and tries to pull Caroline into his lap. Caroline grabs Filippo.

35) 37) dialog: Incroyable!
35) 39) dialog: I see. Yes. Yes, of course. Well, I am on to something right now... and I think I've got... it's just a matter of... this is something that is really going to break open!
35) 43) dialog: It was the end of the road for me. I could see it coming. See it coming? Christ, it was here!
36) 1) dialog: I'd had my chance and I'd blown it away in a bottle. It was over. And I had to face up to that fact.
37) 1) dialog: I could always go back home. Small town, small newspaper. Or I could take the time off, write a novel or two. Or I could slit my wrists. This last suggestion actually seemed the most appealing because, in fact, it required the least amount of effort. The TELEPHONE RINGS.
37) 2) dialog: And then the telephone rang. He answers.
37) 3) dialog: Hello?   Peter Fallow speaking.
38) 2) dialog: Nothing to know, I'm working at                         * home today, that's all.                                 *

40) 0) text: Fox, Peter and the Assistant come outside and descend the escalator..
40) 2) dialog: Well, yeah, but... Look, it's an unfortunate situation. But I'm not altogether sure there's a story in it.
40) 4) dialog: I see. Yes, but what's your interest exactly?
40) 6) dialog: My situation?
40) 10) text: Fox and the assistant get into the limo.          Peter f

41) 5) dialog: I'll have a Scotch and water.
43) 3) dialog: He was a student of yours at Ruppert High. In your English class.
43) 5) dialog: He was seriously injured. I'm a journalist. I write for a newspaper.
43) 7) dialog: What I would like to find out is what kind of student he was.
43) 9) dialog: Would you say he was a 'good' student?
43) 11) dialog: His mother says he was considering going to college.
43) 16) dialog: Well, is there anything at all you can tell me about his performance or aptitude -- anything at all?
43) 18) dialog: Fallow.
43) 20) dialog: Do you have any of his written work?
43) 22) dialog: Well, there must be some record of how he measures up to the others...
43) 24) dialog: (pauses; then) Well, by that standard, is Henry Lamb an honors student?
44) 23) dialog: But it was too late. It was gone. Six hundred million dollars. On Wall Street, a frantic salesman was a dead salesman. And Sherman knew it.
47) 3) dialog: Peter Fallow, from City Light.
47) 5) dialog: Where are all the people?
47) 12) dialog: Peter Fallow, City Light.
47) 14) dialog: Sorry about that.
47) 21) dialog: Look, Reverend, aren't you afraid we may be trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill here? I mean, honestly...
47) 23) dialog: Well, I am a journalist...
47) 25) dialog: I think maybe you've got the wrong man, here.
47) 29) text: Bacon leaves Peter.
47) 43) dialog: Yes.   He certainly is.
47) 45) text: Peter hesitates.      Then...
47) 46) dialog: Oh.    Yes.   Sure. Yes.
47) 48) dialog: No question about it.
65) 3) dialog: Excuse me, Mister McCoy?
65) 7) dialog: You don't know me but I'm...
65) 8) text: But Peter is buried in the onslaught before he can say another word.
69) 1) dialog: It was too much for me. All of it. Sherman McCoy had been swept away from me. Before I could even speak to him. And as the day progressed, I began to appreciate the power, the magnitude of the force that had been unleashed by my little story.
69) 5) dialog: dodges the onslaught, pulls himself up, and starts moving in the opposite direction.
69) 6) dialog: Jackels. Dogs. Yapping at the heels of their prey. And I was one of them. Well, let them have it. Enough is enough. I was finished. I summoned what little dignity I had left and decided to go home...
69) 9) dialog: Jesus Christ.
69) 11) dialog: Yes. I know.     I know that.   What are you...?
69) 13) dialog: You need to get out of here.
69) 17) dialog: This way.   Come on.
69) 22) dialog: Me either. Especially on a first date. But we don't really have a choice.
70) 1) dialog: Are you alright?
70) 3) dialog: Look, I owe you an apology...
70) 5) dialog: You don't know who I am.
70) 7) dialog: Go where?
70) 9) dialog: Look. Sit down. Just sit down a minute. I'll get you home.                              *
70) 10) text: They do.   Peter offers Sherman his bottle.
70) 11) dialog: Would you like a drink? I happen to have a little something...
70) 17) dialog: Go on. Fuck it. What are they going to do? Arrest you?
70) 20) dialog: Not in a million years.
70) 22) dialog: Yeah. But he didn't live in the South Bronx. Did he?
70) 26) dialog: You look like shit.       And you smell, too.

70) 31) dialog: Yeah.
70) 35) dialog: It's okay.   Have another drink.
72) 2) dialog: This is you. You'll be right on Lexington Avenue.
72) 4) dialog: You're not important. You're just dinner. You know what I mean? And a week from now, a month -- nobody is even going to remember what they ate.

72) 12) dialog: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
79) 0) dialog: who looks very depressed.

79) 2) text: PULL BACK to include Peter surrounded by fawning packs of well-wishers, including Gerald Moore.

79) 18) text: Peter makes excuses to Gerald and Evelyn and follows Caroline away.
80) 1) dialog: Where's the phone?

80) 8) dialog: Listen, Caroline. I'm sort of with some people tonight.
80) 10) dialog: Yes. Yes, I do. Franco or Federico...
80) 13) dialog: Caroline, you're absolutely soused.
80) 16) dialog: Caroline, isn't that dangerous? Or at least unsanitary?
80) 22) dialog: You're joking.
80) 24) dialog: But how do you know all this?
80) 26) dialog: You don't know where they are?

81) 9) dialog: Yes.   Uh... where is Maria, by the way?
81) 11) dialog: Uh, yes. And we're doing a little profile piece. We're calling it the 'New Tycoons.' And, naturally, we thought of you.
81) 13) dialog: Oh, there's no hurry. So Maria is in Italy. Where abouts?
81) 15) dialog: Well, there are some great hotels in Lake Como. Is she at the Excelsior?
81) 19) dialog: I'd like to talk to her, too. If I could. If I could get in                        * touch with her...                                    *
81) 26) dialog: Yes.
81) 35) text: Peter tries to laugh with Arthur. But Arthur's coughing turns into a spasm. He pushes his head back against the banquette. He seems to be humming. And then his head drops forward and he slumps against Peter.

81) 38) dialog: Excuse me.   Hello? Excuse me. Waiter!!!
81) 40) dialog: Mr. Ruskin seems to have suffered some kind of -- well, I don't know.
81) 42) dialog: I think you'd better call someone.
81) 45) text: Two waiters   help the Maitre d' pull the table out. Arthur slips   off his plate and falls onto the floor. Some people   notice. But, in general, the activity in the room   continues. The Maitre d' gives orders to the waiters. A MAN approaches Peter.
81) 53) dialog: Well, somebody has to do something.
81) 54) text: Peter tries to perform the Heimlich maneuver on Ruskin.
81) 57) text: Peter lets go of Ruskin.    Ruskin slides to the floor -- dead.

83) 2) dialog: Mrs. Ruskin?
83) 4) dialog: My name is Peter Fallow. I just wanted to offer my sympathy.
83) 7) dialog: Ah, well, yes. I was actually quite close to him when he died.
83) 9) dialog: You shouldn't.
84) 2) dialog: Yes. Just one other thing. I understand you're a friend of Sherman McCoy.
84) 7) dialog: Yes. I gather you were not only in the car with him when he had his unfortunate accident in the Bronx. But I understand you were driving.
84) 10) dialog: I was hoping you might tell me exactly what happened that night.
84) 12) dialog: Fallow.
86) 6) dialog: Look, don't you understand? It is very possible that Sherman McCoy was not driving that car. And I can almost prove it.
86) 10) dialog: The hospital?! What are you talking about?
86) 12) dialog: Alright, alright. But Christ, Albert, this is a great story. This is my exclusive. And it's also the truth!
86) 14) dialog: I can't just drop this now.   I can't just let it go.
86) 25) dialog: 
86) 26) dialog: How could I turn my back on the plight of this grief stricken woman? How could I turn my back on a 'profitable relationship'? I was touched to the depths of what was left of my soul... and my bank account.
87) 4) dialog: So I printed their little story. Well, why not? Why not be the best whore in the house? And anyway, I was beginning to see even greater possibilities in my situation.
89) 1) dialog: Mr. Leach?
89) 3) dialog: I understand you been doing some creative wiring in this building.
89) 4) text: Peter and Leach continue talking.
89) 5) dialog: In less than three minutes, I had what I was looking for. It was more than a story. I had the makings of a book here. A great book. A prize winning effort. All I needed was a big finish.
89) 7) dialog: So I shipped off a little present to Sherman McCoy's lawyer and I waited for the fireworks...
100) 14) text: Sherman and Killian at the defense table. In the audience, Bacon, Fox, Gerald Moore, Weiss and finally Peter Fallow taking notes.
100) 15) dialog: And there it was. The end of Sherman McCoy. And it wasn't the                        * ending I was hoping for. He was                         * finished. She might as well have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. There was no hope now. The darkness closed in around him. And then I noticed the most peculiar thing. Sherman was smiling.
101) 30) dialog: Oh, sorry. I'm Peter Fallow.      I'm Peter Fallow. Ha. Ha. Ha.
101) 33) dialog: Thanks.   I needed that.
102) 8) dialog: It was the last I saw of Sherman McCoy...
102) 10) dialog: And so we come to the end of our story. Sherman, you see, who started with so much, lost everything. But he gained his soul. Whereas I, you see, who started with so little, gained everything...
103) 2) dialog: As he rises unsteadily to his feet the room goes wild with applause. Peter waves and makes his way toward the podium.
103) 3) dialog: But what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses ... Ah, well. There are compensations. Peter reaches the podium and faces a standing ovation. Cameras begin to flash. END CREDITS BEGIN.
103) 4) text: BEGINNING WITH Peter at the podium and CONTINUING to include SHOTS of everyone congratulating Peter -- Albert Fox, Reverend Bacon, Abe Weiss, Gerald Moore, Fillippo Chiarazzi, Kramer, etc. Finally the flashing cameras fade and we...
