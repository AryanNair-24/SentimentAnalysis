14) 4) dialog: That's what I said... Couldn't we                      * just forget about your wife and                        * go on over to our little hideaway                      * on 59th Street and hide away a                         * little?                                                *

21) 4) dialog: Christ. We're in the middle of a goddamn war zone and you're worried about doing the right thing. Look! There!
22) 1) dialog: There! George Washington Bridge, you see it?!
23) 1) dialog: As Sherman pulls toward the ramp. Another pothole jolts the car. Maria's luggage flies forward, hitting Sherman in the back of his neck. At the same time, Maria sees something in the road ahead of them.

26) 6) dialog: Neither did I. So if the question ever comes up, all that happened was, two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us and we got away. That's all we know. They go into...
27) 2) dialog: Yes, let's call them and invite them over here to our little love nest. They would love to get their hands on us. The police and the press and all the rest of the 'mediarites.'
27) 7) dialog: Yes. Newspapers, radios, televisions. I can see it   now. Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park  Avenue and Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of  Fifth Avenue, recuperating after  their adventures in the Bronx -- explain that to your wife.
27) 9) text: Maria unlocks the door and they go into...
28) 2) text: Maria drops everything and turns on him...
28) 3) dialog: You don't have to feel better, Sherman. I was the one who was driving. And I'm saying I didn't hit anybody, and I'm not reporting anything to the police! And if you are a gentleman, you will support me in that decision.
28) 4) text: Silence. They are both out of breath. They look at each other. Then Maria starts to unbutton her blouse.
28) 5) dialog: (very sexy now) We were in the jungle... we were attacked... we fought our way out.

46) 14) dialog: Oh, Sherman. You are    completely paranoidical. Look, I    have to leave for the airport   in twenty minutes. So we don't    have much time.
46) 19) dialog: How? They don't have the full number, they don't have a witness, and the only one who could recognize you is in terminal comatosis.
46) 21) dialog: If he was gonna materialize, he would have done it by now. And the reason he hasn't, is because he's a criminal. Would you get my blue jacket out of that closet?

46) 24) dialog: Filippo Chirazzi. He's a friend of Caroline. Do you know him?

46) 28) dialog: The airport. I told you. I have a car coming in -- oh, God, ten minutes. We have time for a quickie. What do you say?
46) 32) dialog: You know I'm a sucker for a soft dick.
46) 34) dialog: Am I?
46) 37) dialog: And put our heads right into the horse's mouth? I'm the one who was driving the car. Don't you think I'm the one who should make the decision? And I say, no. No, Sherman. Trust me. Nothing is going to come of this little newspaper article. Absolutely nothing.

62) 56) dialog: You see?   It went right over his head.
62) 58) dialog: Of course, darling, but keep smiling. My husband is watching me. Look at him. He's so pleased with himself. He's just closed a new deal. A charter business. He's going to take Arabs to Mecca on airplanes. Sherman tries to smile throughout the following. Boris smiles and nods -- although he doesn't understand a word they're saying.
62) 63) dialog: Of course, the airplanes are all from Israel...
62) 65) dialog: He'll make a fortune.
62) 67) dialog: He called me a whore today. Right in front of the servants. I mean, really. How does he expect me to run the house if he humiliates me in front of the help?
62) 69) dialog: I'm sorry, Sherman.    What are we talking about?
62) 71) dialog: Oh, Sherman, what...?!
62) 72) text: But MRS. BAVARDAGE swirls up to them and whisks the now terrified Maria away.

92) 12) dialog: Oh, Sherman. Would I do that to you? Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
92) 14) dialog: What are we going to do with you?
92) 16) dialog: But how can I help you?
92) 18) dialog: Oh, Sherman, you are the sweetest thing. But I'm not sure anybody knows what really happened. Not anymore. And if anybody does know, it certainly isn't me.
92) 20) dialog: Was I? I don't remember. Isn't it funny how a little thing like that can slip your mind? (she kisses him) God, there's something about funerals that is so stimulating. My panties have been wet all morning.
95) 1) dialog: Sherman.   What's wrong with you?
95) 3) dialog: Then why are you all hunched over? Her hands slide down his back.
95) 5) dialog: Sherman, what's this on your back?
95) 10) dialog: This lump, this piece of metal, this thing on your back?!

95) 30) dialog: My, my, my, Mr. McCoy. I'd say your goose was just about home- fried.
95) 32) dialog: Never. Never. Never. I hope you die and hang in the electric chair!
96) 3) dialog: He's gone!
96) 5) dialog: He just ran out that back door.
97) 2) dialog: Sherman McCoy!
97) 6) dialog: I'm sorry if I alarmed you.    But he was acting very strange.    My name is Maria Ruskin.

97) 11) dialog: Well, you and I have a lot to talk about. Don't we?

100) 12) dialog: Oh, yes.
100) 19) dialog: ... and I wanted to report the incident but he wouldn't let me. He said he was driving and it was his decision to make.

100) 29) dialog: Am I?
100) 34) dialog: (on tape) And put our heads right into the tiger's mouth? I'm the one who was driving the car. Don't you think I'm the one who should make that decision.
100) 35) text: Absolute pandemonium. Fallow starts to laugh. Kramer pulls Sherman's briefcase off a chair revealing a hidden tape recorder. He bangs and kicks the recorder, trying to make it stop.
