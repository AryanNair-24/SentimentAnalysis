He slam him face-first into the window between the office and the dark sales floor. Ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed agains the glass. Big Dave's hands lock around his throat. Big Dave sweats and strains. A crack shoots up the pane of glass. Ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's neck. Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. His hands go up his throat. Ed watches. He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer. Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his head twisted away. He falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him fac down onto the floor. Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his k but with his hands still at his throat. His face and knee awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing someth across the floor with his nose. He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging him in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself throug the wall. Blood is pooling out from under him. Big Dave's legs are still working. His gurgling continues Ed watches. Big Dave's legs start to move furiously. They convulse. H whole body shakes as he goes into shock. Ed watches. Big Dave stops shaking. He remains wedged awkwardly into corner, face-down. He is still. The room is very quiet. Ed looks down at his hands. He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks  across the darkened sales floor.
4) 0) text: Ed walks to his car. He does not look about, is not  particularly furtive. He gets into the car. He starts the ignition.
6) 0) text: Ed gets into bed next to Doris. He stares at the ceiling. Wind rustles outside. The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with t wind. He looks at Doris. Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mout is closed now, her breathing more peaceful. The leafy sha play over her face.
6) 1) dialog: ...It was only a couple of weeks  after we met that Doris suggested  getting married. I said, Don't you  wanna get to know me more? She said,  Why, does it get better? She looked  at me like I was a dope, which I've  never really minded from her. And  she had a point, I guess. We knew  each other as well then as now...

6) 86) text: Ed nods. A beat.
6) 87) dialog: ...So, uh, who should I--
6) 91) dialog: Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for,  uh...
6) 93) dialog: Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
6) 102) dialog: Honey... I brought your make-up.
6) 105) dialog: How are you?
6) 108) dialog: What happened to you?
6) 111) dialog: You don't have to--
6) 113) dialog: You don't have to tell them anything.  We're getting you a lawyer.
6) 116) dialog: Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting  you Freddy Riedenschneider.
6) 119) dialog: You don't have to tell me anything.
6) 124) dialog: Honey...
6) 128) dialog: Yeah.
6) 130) dialog: Frank, uh, you know I'll try to  contribute, but, uh--Freddy  Riedenschneider--
6) 132) dialog: That's very generous.
6) 136) dialog: Uh-huh.
6) 138) dialog: Uh-huh.
6) 140) text: A door opens. A conservatively dressed man of late middle age emerges.
6) 146) text: The man looks dubiously at Ed.
6) 148) dialog: Crane. Ed Crane.
6) 156) text: He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank  trailing dejectedly behind. They enter, the door closes, we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of th words lost. Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime o business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand c to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes  successive documents across his desk with a word of  explanation for each as Frank signs. Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassiv
6) 157) dialog: The barbershop. Doris and Frank's  father had worked thirty years to  own it free and clear. Now it got  signed over to the bank, and the  bank signed some money over to Frank,  and Frank signed the money over...
6) 159) dialog: ...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who  got into town two days later...
6) 160) text: Ed, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape tha obscures the interior. Gilt lettering on the window spell out "DaVinci's".
6) 161) dialog: ...and told me to meet him at  DaVinci's for lunch.
6) 168) text: He looks up at Ed.
6) 170) dialog: Yeah--
6) 172) dialog: No thanks, I--
6) 173) text: The waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of  Riedenschneider.
6) 175) dialog: No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
6) 177) dialog: ...OK.
6) 179) text: He points a finger at Ed.
6) 184) dialog: All going about their business. It  seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger  one even then what had really happened  to Big Dave, something none of them  knew...
6) 185) text: On Ed, driving.
6) 186) dialog: ...Like I had made it to the outside,  somehow, and they were all still  struggling, way down below.
6) 189) dialog: Ann.
6) 192) dialog: Ann. Will you come in?
6) 195) text: Ed nods. After an uncomfortable beat, through which she continues stare:
6) 196) dialog: ...I'm so sorry about your loss.
6) 198) dialog: Of course, you know, Doris had nothing  to do with it. Nothing at all.
6) 199) text: She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm.
6) 201) dialog: Yes, Ann?
6) 203) text: She falls silent. The trees behind her rustle. She gives a wary look back. Then, confidingly, to Ed:
6) 205) text: Ed is puzzled:
6) 206) dialog: Yes?
6) 209) dialog: ...Yes?
6) 211) dialog: Ann--
6) 213) dialog: Ann--
6) 215) dialog: Ann, will you come in, sit down,  maybe have a drink?
6) 217) text: Ed says nothing. She touches his arm.
6) 219) text: She turns and heads down the walk. Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the side then are lost in the rustle of leaves. Ed watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller.
6) 224) dialog: I knew about it. Big Dave told me  about it, and the spot he was putting  himself in by getting the money.
6) 228) dialog: It was Big Dave's.
6) 230) dialog: *I* was with her.
6) 231) text: Riedenschneider gives him a hard look.
6) 234) dialog: ...I killed him.
6) 235) text: Riedenschneider eyes him. Wheels start turning.
6) 237) dialog: He and Doris... were having an affair.
6) 240) dialog: I... just knew. A husband knows.
6) 241) text: Riedenschneider rolls his eyes.
6) 243) dialog: I don't know. I don't think so.
6) 245) dialog: I took Doris's keys.
6) 247) dialog: ...I don't think so.
6) 249) text: Ed returns Riedenschneider's stare. Riedenschneider resum pacing.
6) 253) text: Another nod indicates Ed:
6) 255) text: His pacing becomes more animated.
6) 261) dialog: Of course, there was *one* person  who could confirm Doris's story, or  plenty of it: the dry-cleaning  pansy...
6) 263) dialog: ...But he'd left the hotel, skipped  out on his bill...
6) 265) dialog: He'd also disappeared from the  residence he gave me...
6) 267) dialog: ...owing two month's rent. How could  I have been so stupid. Handing over  $10,000. For a piece of paper. And  the man gone... like a ghost...
6) 269) dialog: ...disappeared into thin air,  vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki.  Gone now. All gone. The money gone.  Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could  I have been so stupid?
6) 270) text: The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a near chair, also listening as Birdy plays. Walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyel droop. As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed and he starts lightly to snore.
6) 274) dialog: Sooner or later everyone needs a  haircut...
6) 276) dialog: We were working for the bank now. We  kept cutting the hair, trying to  stay afloat, make the payments, tread  water, day by day, day by day...
6) 277) text: Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's ta the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the ba reading an indictment. Doris stands next to Freddy  Riedenschneider.
6) 278) dialog: Most people think someone's accused  of a crime, they haul 'em in and  bring 'em to trial, but it's not  like that, it's not that fast. The  wheels of justice turn slow...
6) 280) dialog: They have an arraignment, and then  the indictment, and they entertain  motions to dismiss, and postpone,  and change the venue, and alter this  and that and the other. They empanel  a jury, which brings more motions,  and they set a trial date and then  change the date, and then often as  not they'll change it again.
6) 282) text: Our boom down has ended close on Doris. We hear Freddy  Riedenschneider, off:
6) 285) dialog: And through all of it we cut the  hair.
6) 288) dialog: ...Meanwhile, Freddy Riedenschneider  slept at the Metropole...
6) 290) dialog: ...and shoveled it in at DaVinci's.
6) 292) dialog: He'd brought in a private investigator  from Sacramento...
6) 294) dialog: ...to nose around into Big Dave's  past.
6) 296) dialog: I found myself more and more going  over to the Abundas's. It was a  routine we fell into, most every  evening. I even went when Walter was  away on his research trips. He was a  genealogist, had traced back his  side of the family seven generations,  his late wife's, eight. It seemed  like a screwy hobby. But then maybe  all hobbies are. Maybe Walter found  something there, in the old county  courthouses, hospital file rooms,  city archives, property rolls,  registries, something maybe like  what I found listening to Birdy play.  Some kind of escape. Some kind of  peace...
6) 297) text: The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, b then is snapped by a sharp clang.
6) 299) dialog: 'Lo, honey.
6) 300) text: She looks at his hands on top of hers. A long beat. Still gazing up into the shaft of light, Freddy  Riedenschneider announces:
6) 308) text: With a slight weight shift, Burns tips his chair so that front legs slap down onto the floor. He fishes a small  notebook from an inside pocket. His boredom is profound; his only concession to performan is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to th other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech.
6) 313) text: Riedenschneider nods, smiling.
6) 316) dialog: ...So?
6) 317) text: Riedenschneider's fixed smile now fades.
6) 319) text: Ed and Doris look at each other.
6) 320) dialog: ...I don't get it.
6) 322) dialog: Yeah.
6) 326) dialog: So... who... who actually--
6) 331) dialog: Honey...?
6) 332) text: The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh Ed frowns.
6) 333) dialog: ...Honey?
6) 338) dialog: Who?
6) 340) text: Over her continued playing:
6) 341) dialog: So maybe Riedenschneider could get  Doris off. Maybe it would all work  out. And I thought--I hoped--that  maybe there was a way out for me as  well...
6) 345) dialog: The girl had talent, anyone could  see that. And *she* wasn't some fly- by-nighter, she was just a good clean  kid...
6) 347) dialog: ...If she was going to have a career  she'd need a responsible adult looking  out for her...
6) 348) text: We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set out on the gym floor for the audience of students and par many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to res on Ed.
6) 349) dialog: ...some kind of... manager. She'd  have contracts to look at, be going  on tours, playing on the radio maybe.  I could help her sort through all of  that, without charging her an arm  and a leg, just enough to get by...
7) 0) text: Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the war summer night. He looks around the parking lot.
7) 1) dialog: ...I could afford to charge less  than the usual manager, not having  to put up a big front like a lot of  these phonies. And I could be with  her, enough to keep myself feeling  OK...
7) 3) dialog: ...Why couldn't that work?... Why  not?...
7) 4) text: Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy' drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults
7) 6) dialog: Hello, Birdy. I thought that was  very good.
7) 8) dialog: Hello, Tony.
7) 10) text: Silence. The teens wait for the adult to direct the  conversation; Ed has nothing to say. At length, he clears his throat.
7) 11) dialog: ...Well, congratulations. I guess  I'll be getting home.
7) 14) dialog: ...Anyway, that's what I was thinking  about in the days leading up to the  trial. It seemed like once that was  over, I'd be ready for a new start.  Freddy Riedenschneider was very  optimistic. He was busy preparing...
7) 15) text: We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschn hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out w He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some  tonic in his hair.
7) 16) dialog: ...And finally it came... the first  day of the trial...
7) 17) text: Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair.
7) 18) dialog: ...What Riedenschneider called the  Big Show.
7) 22) text: Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery directly behind Riedenschneider.
7) 24) text: Ed shrugs. Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back.
7) 28) text: Riedenschneider is curt:
7) 31) text: Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed.
7) 33) text: The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the jud bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters. The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back d and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his  desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneid and the prosecutor.
7) 35) text: Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does h counterpart from the other table. The judge, still leanin forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audibl from the gallery. The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed ton Frank leans in toward Ed.
7) 37) text: Ed, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who sudden stiffens. As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider looks back over his shoulder at Ed.
7) 39) text: The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their  respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man  standing to one side.
7) 41) text: As the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider look down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens va papers.
7) 45) text: As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head.
7) 48) dialog: She'd hanged herself. I'd brought  her a dress to wear to court and  she'd used the belt. I didn't  understand it either. At first I  thought maybe it had something to do  with me, that she'd figured out  somehow how I fit into it and couldn't  stand it, couldn't stand knowing...
7) 50) dialog: ...That wasn't it, I would find out  later. For now, everything just seemed  ruined...
7) 52) dialog: ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back  to Sacramento still shaking his head,  saying it was the biggest  disappointment of his professional  career...
7) 54) dialog: ...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect  he was drinking; anyway, he stopped  coming to work...
7) 56) dialog: ...That left me to keep the place  going, or the bank would've taken  it.
7) 58) dialog: ...*I* was the principal barber now.  I hired a new man for the second  chair...
7) 59) text: Ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer.
7) 60) dialog: ...I'd hired the guy who did the  least gabbing when he came in for an  interview. But I guess the new man  had only kept quiet because he was  nervous; once he had the job, he  talked from the minute I opened the  shop in the morning...
8) 0) text: It is evening. Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to h on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticula to illustrate his store.
8) 1) dialog: ...until I locked up at night. For  all I know, he talked to himself on  the way home.
8) 3) dialog: ...When *I* walked home, it seemed  like everyone avoided looking at  me...
8) 4) text: Indeed, none of the passers-by establish eye contact; the averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng.
8) 5) dialog: ...as if I'd caught some disease.  This thing with Doris, nobody wanted  to talk about it; it was like I was  a ghost walking down the street...
8) 7) dialog: ...And when I got home now, the place  felt empty.
8) 9) dialog: ...I sat in the house, but there was  nobody there. I was a ghost; I didn't  see anyone; no one saw me...
8) 11) dialog: ...I was the barber.
8) 22) text: Ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photog of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering the sky. The caption underneath: ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO.
8) 24) text: Ed looks up. A man in a black suit and fedora has directed the questio at the new man, who looks up from his gabbling, momentari slackjawed.
8) 25) dialog: ...I'm Crane.
8) 27) dialog: Yeah?
8) 29) text: Diedrickson looks around uncomfortably.
8) 31) text: Ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock,  addresses the new man, who still gapes.
8) 32) dialog: Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?
8) 36) dialog: Just coffee.
8) 38) text: Ed shrugs and shakes his head.
8) 40) text: He leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bart and stares at them. After a beat:
8) 42) text: Ed doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring a his hands, plows on:
8) 44) dialog: Told what?
8) 46) text: The bartender has set down the drinks. Diedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from h glass. Finally:
8) 54) dialog: My wife and I had not... performed  the sex act in many years.
8) 55) text: Diedrickson stiffens.
8) 63) dialog: Doris and I had never really talked  much. I don't think that's a bad  thing, necessarily. But it was funny:  now I wanted to talk--now, with  everyone gone. I was alone, with  secrets I didn't want and no one to  tell them to anyway.
8) 64) text: The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.
8) 66) dialog: I visited a woman who was supposed  to have powers in communicating with  those who had passed across, as she  called it. She said that people who  passed across were picky about who  they'd communicate with, not like  most people you run into on this  side...
8) 67) text: The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed.
8) 69) text: Ed places his hand in the center of the table.
8) 70) dialog: ...so you needed a guide who they  didn't mind talking to, someone with  a gift for talking to souls...
8) 71) text: Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes.
8) 72) dialog: ...Well, first she told me that my  wife was in a peaceful place, that  our souls were still connected by  some spiritual bond, that she had  never stopped loving me even though  she'd done some things she wasn't  proud of...
8) 73) text: Ed looks up at the old woman.
8) 74) dialog: ...She was reading me like a book.
8) 75) text: She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction.
8) 76) dialog: ...And then she started talking about  'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that  and was there anything I wanted to  tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just  be telling it to the old bat. And  even if somehow Doris could hear, it  wouldn't be on account of this so- called medium.
8) 78) dialog: She was a phony. Just another gabber.
9) 0) text: Ed emerges from the building.
9) 1) dialog: I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger,  Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my  back on the old lady, on the veils,  on the ghosts, on the dead, before  they all sucked me in...
9) 2) text: Ed disappears into the night.
9) 5) dialog: I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
9) 8) dialog: Yeah.
9) 10) dialog: Sure, Walter. Thanks.
9) 13) dialog: Hello, Birdy.
9) 15) text: Ed sits across from her.
9) 16) dialog: Yeah.
9) 18) dialog: Birdy, I've been doing a lot of  thinking. There are a lot of things  that haven't worked out for me. Life  has dealt me some bum cards...
9) 20) dialog: ...or maybe I just haven't played  'em right, I don't know. But you're--
9) 22) text: Ed stares. This takes a moment to register.
9) 23) dialog: Oh. Sorry.
9) 26) text: Ed is pocketing the cigarette.
9) 27) dialog: Sure... Sure, it's his house.
9) 29) text: Ed smiles thinly.
9) 30) dialog: Anyway, uh... my point is you're  young. A kid really, your whole life  ahead of you. But it's not too soon  to start thinking... to start making  opportunities for yourself. Before  it all washes away.
9) 32) dialog: That's swell. However, the music, if  you want to pursue it, well, the  lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only  take you so far. There's this guy in  San Francisco, I've made inquiries,  everybody says he's the best. Trained  lots of people who've gone on to  have big concert careers, symphony  orchestras, the works. His name is  Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure  I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway,  he's a Frenchman.
9) 34) dialog: You've got talent, anyone could see  that. And he's the best. If he thinks  a student has talent, he'll take 'em  on for next to nothing. You're a  cinch to be accepted, I could cover  the cost of the lessons, like I said,  it's pretty modest--
9) 36) dialog: I have to do it. I can't stand by  and watch more things go down the  drain. You're young, you don't  understand.
9) 38) dialog: I know you haven't. Look, just go  meet him as a favor to me. I talked  to this guy. Hope I pronounced his  name right. He sounded very busy,  but he's not a bad egg; he loosened  up a little when I told him how  talented you are. He agreed to see  you this Saturday. He said maybe you  were a diamond in the rough. His  words.
9) 40) dialog: Just see him, as a favor to me.
9) 43) dialog: No. Uh... family friend.
9) 48) text: A jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise.
9) 51) dialog: Uh-huh.
9) 53) dialog: Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
9) 59) dialog: Well? How'd she do?
9) 62) dialog: I don't understand.
9) 64) dialog: Did she make mistakes?
9) 67) dialog: I don't understand, no mistakes,  she's just a kid--I thought you taught  the, uh, the--
9) 69) text: A two-handed gesture, indicating his heart.
9) 75) dialog: Well, look, I don't claim to be an  expert--
9) 79) dialog: He didn't say that.
9) 81) dialog: Look, I'm no expert, but--
9) 83) dialog: I'm sure there's a dozen teachers  better than this clown. More  qualified. Goddamn phony.
9) 85) text: Ed looks at her.
9) 87) dialog: ...Uh-huh.
9) 89) dialog: Ah... it's nothing.
9) 91) dialog: Huh.
9) 93) dialog: Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
9) 95) dialog: ...I guess I've been all wet.
9) 99) dialog: Birdy--
9) 103) text: Ed is shocked:
9) 104) dialog: Birdy!
9) 106) dialog: ...No, please.
9) 108) text: The blare of an oncoming horn. Ed looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on the wheel. The oncoming car. Ed swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams. CRASH: the car hits a roadside tree. BLACK.
9) 109) dialog: Time slows down right before an  accident, and I had time to think  about things. I thought about what  an undertaker had told me once--that  your hair keeps growing, for a while  anyway, after you die...
9) 111) dialog: ...and then it stops. I thought,  what keeps it growing? Is it like a  plant in soil? What goes out of the  soil? The soul? And when does the  hair realize that it's gone?
9) 112) text: We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head  resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. We boom down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. As we mov we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry. The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a b revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it  disappears, leaving only black.
9) 115) dialog: Hello.
9) 120) text: Ed shrugs.
9) 122) text: Ed shrugs again.
9) 123) dialog: Doesn't bother me.
9) 131) text: The man gives a practiced laugh.
9) 133) text: Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case.
9) 137) text: The man gazes at her. His smile fades fast and he and Dor stare at each other, two hard cases. He turns stiffly and stalks off. Once his gaze has broken, Doris turns as well. She stalks the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen fron door of the house, letting it slam behind her. Quiet, early evening. Ed sits, smoking. At length he rises and goes in to the house.
10) 0) text: It is dim, no lights on yet. We hear banging and clomping from the kitchen. Doris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes ar a drink with a swizzle stick. Her face is still hard-set. With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto couch. Ed sits as well. He draws on his cigarette, drags an asht closer on the coffee table. She sips. He puffs.
10) 1) dialog: ...Doris--
10) 6) text: A blurry white disc is fading up. As it focuses it resolv into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning close. He leans away, murmuring:
10) 8) text: Ed is lying in a hospital bed. His face is bandaged and o side is grotesquely swollen. The machine noise is life  support.
10) 18) text: Ed's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia:
10) 19) dialog: Birdy... I didn't mean to--
10) 21) dialog: Birdy...
10) 26) dialog: Big Dave.
10) 35) text: Light glimmers in water. We are drifting down, down, down We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child, w to keep himself submerged. It is a ten-year-old boy stari wide-eyed, at something in front of him. Bubbles  intermittently stream from his open mouth.
10) 36) dialog: The pansy. A kid diving at a waterhole  outside of town had found his car...
10) 37) text: The reverse shows the car, also submerged, with Creighton Tolliver inside, also wide-eyed, his hairpiece attached a only one corner, the rest of it waving free.
10) 38) dialog: ...They'd winched it out...
10) 39) text: We are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated  men. The men rise.
10) 40) dialog: ...and found he'd been beaten, just  like Big Dave said--beaten to death...
10) 41) text: We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the sm door behind his raised bench.
10) 42) dialog: ...Inside the briefcase were the  partnership papers I'd signed...
10) 44) dialog: ...showing that I'd given him ten  grand. For the district attorney...
10) 46) dialog: ...that made it fall into place: I'd  gotten Doris to steal the money, the  pansy had gotten wise somehow, and  I'd had to kill him to cover my  tracks. I was in a spot. I called in  Freddy Riedenschneider...
10) 47) text: Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table. As listens to the charge:
10) 48) dialog: ...and signed the house over to him.  He said he didn't ordinarily work  that cheap, but he figured he owed  me something since the last one hadn't  played out...
10) 49) text: The drone of the D.A. has ended and Riedenschneider's ech voice drops into the hole:
10) 51) dialog: I tried to tell him the whole story,  but Riedenschneider stopped me. He  said the story made his head hurt,  and anyway he didn't see any way of  using it without putting me on the  hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
10) 52) text: Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as sits next to him. Ed still wears a cast on one arm and on leg.
10) 53) dialog: ...He told me not to worry, though,  said he'd think of something, Freddy  Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.
10) 55) dialog: ...They put me on twenty-four-hour  deathwatch...
10) 56) text: A reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightba chair, outside the cell door, staring at Ed.
10) 57) dialog: ...so that I couldn't Cheat Justice  like they said my wife had done...
10) 59) dialog: ...But in front of the jury they had  it that Doris was a saint; the whole  plan had been mine, I was a Svengali  who'd forced Doris to join my criminal  enterprise...
10) 60) text: The district attorney is pointing at Ed.
10) 62) dialog: On and on it went, how I'd used Doris  and then let her take the fall. That  stuff smarted because some of it was  close to being true...
10) 63) text: The district attorney seats himself. The jury's eyes turn Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or se inspiration for his own.
10) 64) dialog: ...And then it was Freddy  Riedenschneider's turn.
10) 65) text: Riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk.
10) 66) dialog: ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed  a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked  about how I'd lost my place in the  universe...
10) 68) dialog: ...how I was too ordinary to be the  criminal mastermind the D.A. made me  out to be, how there was some greater  scheme at work that the state had  yet to unravel, and he threw in some  of the old truth stuff he hadn't had  a chance to trot out for Doris...
10) 70) dialog: ...He told them to look at me--look  at me close. That the closer they  looked the less sense it would all  make, that I wasn't the kind of guy  to kill a guy, that I was the barber,  for Christ's sake...
10) 71) text: We pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider.
10) 72) dialog: ...I was just like them, an ordinary  man, guilty of living in a world  that had no place for me, guilty of  wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure,  but not of murder...
10) 73) text: Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foregr to point a finger directly at Ed's face.
10) 74) dialog: ...He said I *was* Modern Man, and  if they voted to convict me, well,  they'd be practically cinching the  noose around their own necks. He  told them to look not at the facts  but at the meaning of the facts, and  then he said the facts *had* no  meaning. It was a pretty good speech,  and even had me going...
10) 75) text: A tap on the shoulder turns Ed around.
10) 76) dialog: ...until Frankie interrupted it.
10) 77) text: Frank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor. A bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over Ed, bellowing through tears:
10) 79) text: Riedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and E loudly protesting:
10) 81) text: Ed moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong  glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on th floor.
10) 83) dialog: ...Well, he got his mistrial, but  the well had run dry. There was  nothing left to mortgage;  Riedenschneider went home and the  court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
10) 84) text: Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentlema who enters the plea in the new trial:
10) 86) dialog: ...who threw me on the mercy of the  court. It was my only chance, he  said. I guess that meant I never had  a chance...
10) 90) dialog: He wasn't buying any of that Modern  Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff,  or any of the mercy stuff either.  No, he was going by the book, and  the book said I got the chair...
10) 91) text: Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bu hands clasped behind his head.
10) 92) dialog: ...so here I am. At first I didn't  know how I got here. I knew step by  step of course, which is what I've  told you, step by step; but I couldn't  see any pattern...
10) 94) dialog: ...Now that I'm near the end, I'm  glad that this men's magazine paid  me to tell my story. Writing it has  helped me sort it all out. They're  paying five cents a word, so you'll  pardon me if sometimes I've told you  more than you wanted to know...
10) 95) text: Recent issues of the magazine, Gent, and its sister  publication Nugget lie on the little desk. Their lurid co depict feature stories like I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS and 
10) 98) dialog: ...But now, all the disconnected  things seems to hook up.
10) 99) text: Ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes eyes.
10) 100) dialog: ...That's the funny thing about going  away, knowing the date you're gonna  die--and the men's magazine wanted  me to tell how that felt...
10) 101) text: We hear a pulsing treble hum. Ed opens his eyes. The door to his cell is open. He rises and goes through the door.
10) 103) dialog: ...Well, it's like pulling away from  the maze. While you're in the maze  you go through willy-nilly, turning  where you think you have to turn,  banging into dead ends, one thing  after another...
10) 105) dialog: ...But get some distance on it, and  all those twists and turns, why,  they're the shape of your life. It's  hard to explain...
10) 107) dialog: ...But seeing it whole gives you  some peace.
10) 108) text: Ed turns and re-enters the prison.
10) 110) dialog: ...The men's magazine also asked  about remorse. Yeah, I guess I'm  sorry about the pain I caused other  people...
10) 112) dialog: ...but I don't regret anything. Not  a thing. I used to. I used to regret  being the barber.
10) 114) dialog: ...I dont know where I'm being taken.
10) 115) text: Ed is placed in the chair.
10) 116) dialog: ...I don't know what waits for me,  beyond the earth and sky. But I'm  not afraid to go.
10) 117) text: A man stoops at his feet. He has a bucket of water and a  straight razor. He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a pa of Ed's calf.
10) 118) dialog: ...Maybe the things I don't understand  will be clearer there, like when a  fog blows away...
10) 119) text: Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to th bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating hairs.
10) 120) dialog: ...Maybe Doris will be there.
10) 122) dialog: ...And maybe there I can tell her...
10) 124) dialog: ...all those things...
10) 125) text: A thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch As he reaches for the switch, Ed looks up into the light.
10) 126) dialog: ...they don't have words for here.
