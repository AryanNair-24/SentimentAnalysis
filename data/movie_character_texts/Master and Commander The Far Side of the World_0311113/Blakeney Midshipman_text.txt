0) 84) text: By all that's holy what is that ship made of? His question coincides with a third full broadside from t Frenchman. The Surprise's wheel shattered. BONDEN thrown aside, MR. WATT jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenma hit. A rope sheers and JOE PLAICE is smacked on the skull by a swinging boom. Midshipman BLAKENEY, running up on deck, goes to help PLA and is struck down by a flying splinter - a shocking woun his upper right arm.
0) 143) text: (sotto) A severe depressed fracture of the skull. I am not sure he will see out the night. Moving on to another barely recognizable face: young Blakeney, pale and sweaty, breathing hard from the pain a the blood loss. JACK
0) 144) text: Mr. Blakeney? BLAKENEY
0) 204) text: Its alright. William. You were dreaming. Blakeney looks around, disoriented and finds Calamy by hi side. BLAKENEY
0) 206) text: You know old Joe, always telling [ ] stories. BLAKENEY
0) 208) text: Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine first. BLAKENEY (drifting)
0) 210) text: (nods) Nor any other part of you. Trying to make light of it, though he fears BLAKENEY is dying.
0) 216) text: It is the laudanum speaking. You will be a regular Nelson. He tests the edge of his knife with his thumb. CALAMY places the leather gag between BLAKENEY's teeth. Padeen mumbles a Gaelic prayer. STEPHEN turns and grips BLAKENEY shattered arm. A sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutt off the arm. Close on STEPHEN, lips compressed, utterly focussed. He puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula the pail of hot tar. BLAKENEY has not uttered a sound, though he is shaking uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears. CALAMY has tears in his eyes also. STEPHEN finishes his work, breathing hard, a gentle smile BLAKENEY. STEPHEN (CONT'D)
0) 220) text: You would have died else. Blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away CALAMY (CONT'D)
0) 265) text: Not good enough! We must fire three broadsides to her two. Again! Turning to BLAKENEY, who though much recovered, still loo pale and a little unsure of himself. JACK (CONT'D)
0) 266) text: Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a gun? BLAKENEY
0) 268) text: 'Spitfire', hop to it. BLAKENEY takes command of the gun. To one side CALAMY is charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side HOLLOM is now directing 'Sudden Death'. Once again the orders are given, and the crews, now compe with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions', 'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge. Ball. Prime. Run out gun. Prime. Aim. Stand clear... Fire!!'
0) 296) text: And may they never meet. Amid the laughter someone bumps Blakeney's stump. He winc then puts a brave face on it BLAKENEY (to JACK)
0) 298) text: Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of serving under him at the Nile. (aside) Mr. Mowett, the bottle stands by you, sir. (as the bottle moves on) In fact I dined with him twice, and he spoke to me on both occasions. The table goes quiet. BLAKENEY is wide-eyed, though partl from his strenuous efforts to appear sober. JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)
0) 351) text: Exercises? BLAKENEY
0) 353) text: I think that will happen with usage, at least to a certain extent. BLAKENEY
0) 355) text: No but you will adapt to your new situation The natural world shows us any number of examples of how that is possible. Blakeney bites his lip BLAKENEY
0) 357) text: Ah. Like me you mean. BLAKENEY
0) 369) text: Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then wet the sails and have the idlers placed along the rail. PULLINGS and HOLLAR bark out their orders. Men race to ob JACK steps up on the gunwale, spying out the distant ship BLAKENEY, nearby, rests his telescope on CALAMY's shoulde focussing with his left hand. BLAKENEY
0) 371) text: Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin to join us, he loves a good chase. BLAKENEY goes below. Above, the topmen release more sail which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables. Those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance pull of the sails.
0) 488) text: Blakeney... WILLIAMSON
0) 494) text: It's tails. We attack. CALAMY's side retire to a defensive position made of tar barrels at one end of the deck. From here they are sudden aware of Jack idly watching their mock-fight from the quarter-deck WILLIAMSON's team give a yell and charge at them. It's serious fighting. Heads are struck, fingers are rapp BLAKENEY, trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated his own ineptitude, goes down under the rush of attackers BLAKENEY
0) 499) text: It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in it, just powder. He helps BLAKENEY to his feet. CALAMY (CONT'D)
0) 500) text: Are you all right? BLAKENEY
0) 502) text: What's wrong? I saved you. BLAKENEY
0) 558) text: He's not sick. He's useless. He's just dodging work. BLAKENEY (angrily)
0) 559) text: Oh shut up Calamay. What do you know about anything? CALAMY glares at BLAKENEY.
0) 600) text: You don't think...? There is a knock on the cabin door and BLAKENEY enters, agitated. BLAKENEY (to STEPHEN)
0) 611) text: Much better, thank you. BLAKENEY
0) 614) text: You've always been very kind to me. Goodbye, Blakeney. With a sudden movement he's on the gunwale, then he jumps over the side the cannonball in his arms. BLAKENEY looks down with shock to see HOLLOM's pale face receding from him into the depths. It's a moment before h gathers his wits to shout - BLAKENEY
0) 617) text: The fact is, [   ] not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be. But we are all God's creatures. If some of us thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill of him, or failed him in respect of fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness, Lord, and we ask for his. Close on the faces of the crew - KILLICK, HIGGINS, NAGEL, CALAMY, BLAKENEY and finally Stephen who is staring oddly Jack, as though holding him partly responsible for this latest tragedy. JACK (CONT'D)
0) 634) text: How extraordinary. BLAKENEY
0) 637) text: A species of cormorant. But apparently flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe that is unknown to science. BLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing bird then drifts back to the iguanas. BLAKENEY
0) 639) text: They are a type of iguana I should think, and therefore vegetarian. His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENE wholly absorbed in the iguanas. BLAKENEY
0) 641) text: Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some eggs. BLAKENEY
0) 643) text: Oh! Recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to BLAKENEY's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards. STEPHEN (CONT'D)
0) 650) text: All hands about ship! BLAKENEY dashes off and STEPHEN is elbowed out of the way hands rushing to get at the sails. NEHEMIAH SLADE
0) 656) text: We was coming back for fresh lines, hid in that inlet, yonder. Black-three master. Bit beamy and raised in the stern. Meaningful looks among Jack and his men. Its definitely t Acheron he's describing [   ] Hogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water, gulps it down, passes it back to BLAKENEY for a refill. HOGG (CONT'D)
0) 685) text: Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on the deck. He opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown beetle. BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
0) 687) text: I'm sure of it. BLAKENEY
0) 689) text: That is more than likely, sure. BLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN. BLAKENEY
0) 691) text: Thank you, Mr. Blakeney. BLAKENEY hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversat then retreats.
3) 13) text: My goodness, what is this? BLAKENEY starts rolling up the sides of the tent as PADEE unloads his boxes, each with a beetle and a piece of vegetation in it. BLAKENEY
3) 14) text: Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing some collecting for you. The beetles each come with a specimen of plant they were found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There he goes. He finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collect of cages, with native wildfowl in them, being fed by the poulterer, JEMMY DUCKS. BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
3) 15) text: The birds were snared by Jemmy Ducks. Captain says we can keep them in the chicken coop. Then, producing a notebook - BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
3) 17) text: 'Pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist. BLAKENEY is flattered but unsure. BLAKENEY
3) 20) text: Shall we take a tour of your aviary? BLAKENEY looks doubtfully at the doctor's bandaged abdome BLAKENEY
3) 23) text: (To Blakeney) How long does the Captain intend that we stay here, do you know?
3) 29) text: "Empty-handed"? Not a bit of it. What about these plants and animals which Blakeney has been collecting? The British museum will need an entire new wing for 'em. STEPHEN regards him gravely, shaking his head. STEPHEN
3) 36) text: No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an experiment of absolutely vital importance. But afterwards, I do desire to find that flightless cormorant, assuming that is what it is, and that I still have strength enough to catch it.
3) 46) text: A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any ship's captain. He's breathing hard, exhausted. BLAKENEY
3) 47) text: You must carry him, Padeen! PADEEN looks at the collection of baskets he carries. BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
3) 48) text: Leave them! We must get back to the ship. STEPHEN raises his hand in protest, but BLAKENEY is alrea divesting PADEEN of his load.
3) 55) text: Tell him, Mr. Blakeney. BLAKENEY (beaming)
3) 57) text: A phasmid? BLAKENEY
3) 58) text: It's an insect disguised as a stick. JACK stares at the creature. BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
3) 91) dialog: 
3) 93) text: That's not your station. BLAKENEY looks from CALAMY to the others, who avoid his e BLAKENEY
3) 95) text: I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders. BLAKENEY is devastated. Rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement. RYE
3) 103) text: (to Mowett) Run up Portuguese colours. (then down to the gun-deck) Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em. BLAKENEY comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking flushed and angry. BLAKENEY
3) 105) text: No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers here. BLAKENEY
3) 107) text: (interrupts) I know what you want to say and my answer is no. I promised your mother I would return you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score. You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr. Maturin. BLAKENEY
3) 109) text: Go to your station, Mr. Blakeney. BLAKENEY begins to salute, doesn't, and retires, tears burning his eyes. A moment later there's a flash of orange astern as the Acheron opens up with her bow-chasers. An 18 pound shot screams past the side of the Surprise to land with a colu of spray just off their bows. JACK (CONT'D)
3) 191) text: Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble up! Tumble up! In close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY HOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
