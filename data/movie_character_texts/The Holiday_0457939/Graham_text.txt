21) 29) dialog: Oh, yes, fine. Really sorry about the intrusion. Obviously, I had no idea about this exchange thing and although I may not appear it, I am actually Iris' very respectable big brother, however, on the rare, or not so rare occasion that I come into town and get inordinately pissed, my sweet sister, puts me up so I don't get behind the wheel.

21) 78) dialog: That's harsh.
21) 80) dialog: Strangely, not at all. How do you feel about foreplay?
21) 82) dialog: You are quickly becoming one of the most interesting girls I've ever met. Amanda rises, grabs the wine bottle and walks to the ster turns it on, then walks backwards, facing Graham, leading into the bedroom. Graham follows her, unbuttoning his shi as he goes.

22) 11) dialog: (unsettled) Okay...
22) 13) dialog: (seriously) Definitely. (then) And, just for the record, your ex- boyfriend is, in my opinion, quite mistaken about you.

22) 32) dialog: Well, like I said, Most Interesting Girl Award. AMANDA. I'm going to try to see that as a compliment.
22) 33) dialog: You should. (putting on his coat and scart) Okay, se, this is refreshing. Utter honesty. Alright then, so you probably won't be hearing from me because even if you wanted to, which you clearly don't...I have the classic male problem of no follow through. Absolutely never remember to call after a date.... But... as this wasn't a date, I guess I'm off the hook.
22) 35) dialog: (takes a sec...) But what if I wanted to call you? Amanda doesn't know what to say.
22) 36) dialog: Right. Well, if your flight is cancelled or you change your mind...I'm meeting some friends in (MORE)

28) 6) dialog: (smiles) I was.
28) 8) dialog: We did not.
28) 10) dialog: Now that was me actually.
28) 12) dialog: No, it wasn't.
28) 14) dialog: Was not. I was...kidding. Obviously not very well. 57.
28) 16) dialog: Amanda, call me old fashioned but one does not have sex with women who are unconscious.
28) 18) dialog: Because you asked me to.
28) 20) dialog: From the moment I met you, it's been an adventure.
28) 23) dialog: I should probably take this one. Graham very warmly says "Hello" as he EXITS OUT THE FRONT DOOR. Amanda WATCHES GRAHAM THROUGH THE WINDOW, talking o his cell in the FRONT YARD. He's laughing. Amanda can't help but feel a little jealous.
28) 25) dialog: I think we should go into town.
28) 27) dialog: I think you should get dressed, we should take a drive, get some lunch and get to know each other.

29) 5) dialog: Yes, how ‘bout that. The Toddler cranes her neck out of the stroller to watch them. Graham grabs Amanda's hand and quickens their pace. At a stoplight, a real Knock Out sits behind the wheel of Jaguar XK. She glares at Graham. He waves politely. She gives him the finger.

32) 12) dialog: Well, the better the writer, the less notes I have to give.
32) 14) dialog: Literature.
32) 16) dialog: Okay, my palms are starting to sweat, I feel like I'm on a job interview.
32) 18) dialog: Well, since we've already had sex and slept together twice, I think we can bend the first date rules. Why are you blushing?
32) 22) dialog: Ckay, we're doing well. Now what was the question? Oh, did I always know I wanted to be a book editor. The answer is... Yes I did. My family's in publishing. My father's a writer of historical fiction and my mother was and is to this day, a very important editor at Random House.
32) 24) dialog: Yes I did. She's very formidable. May be the best there is at the job and doesn't let you forget it.
32) 26) dialog: My parents are not only still together, they are still madiy in love. Hideously so.
32) 28) dialog: Because, honestly, it borders on obscene. They're old and they've been spotted making out while walking the dogs. They call each other ten times a day. They set the bar very high when it comes to relationships and commitment which could explain my sister in love with a man who does not even appreciate her and of course, my disastrous romantic life. Okay, believe your time's up. Your turn.
32) 30) dialog: I didn't realize you owned the company.
32) 32) dialog: No, no, I'm still a little intimidated by it.
32) 34) dialog: What about your family?

32) 44) dialog: I happen to be telling the truth. A good book, a great film, the opera... I more than cry. I weep. I'm a major weeper. It's pathetic, is what it is. Strangers have made fun of me...

DISSOLVE TO LATER and Graham moves his seat from ac the table to next to Amanda on the banquette. LATER, THEY WALK THE SNOW COVERED GROUNDS... sit on a snow covered hillside, lean back and kiss, the snow creating a blanket underneath them.

34) 6) dialog: And that doesn't make it complicated?
34) 8) dialog: Which is why it's usually better to have it. -- Some say. (she laughs but doesn't bite) Okay, it's bloody freezing. He turns the car back on.
34) 10) dialog: We're back to being awkward with each other. Did you see this coming?
34) 14) dialog: I'm in the directory.
34) 16) dialog: Good. Amanda gets out of the car, shivers, making him laugh, th runs into the house. Graham sits there, thinking. HEAR a DOORBELL. AND A DOOR OPENS - IN L.A. And Miles is on the other side of it, holding a Fed Ex package.

37) 20) dialog: Sorry. Yes. Of course. Come in,
38) 4) dialog: Yes.
38) 6) dialog: Yes... May I?
38) 8) dialog: No... Amanda takes off her coat to reveal a drop dead gorgeous, cut, sexy dress. Olivia, Sophie and Graham just stare at her. Olivia giggles.
38) 16) dialog: Yes, the idiot will drink it.
38) 19) dialog: (whispering) I apologize for not mentioning this earlier...
38) 21) dialog: Amanda, are you by any chance at all into hot chocolate? The Girls look to her. Is she?

39) 3) dialog: You too, Soph.
39) 7) dialog: No she doesn't, you each have five. (hands a mug to Amanda) You have five too. Graham takes a seat.
39) 14) dialog: (unable to see) Comfortable?
39) 16) dialog: Do you think there's a chance you won't spill this on me? With that Olivia tips her hot chocolate and some of it sp on Graham's pants.
39) 17) dialog: Ahbhh..... Thank you, excelient timing. The Girls laugh.
39) 20) dialog: Because she can't sit still. ouch.
39) 26) dialog: No, no, we do not do Mr. Napkin Head for company.
39) 28) dialog: Cuch. Girls, calm down.
39) 30) dialog: O-kay if you settle down, I'1l do it. Quickly. Olivia grabs him and kisses him.
39) 31) dialog: Thank you for that...
39) 33) dialog: Amanda, may I have your napkin, please? Amanda hands Graham her cloth napkin and he places it ove his head, covering his face. He then takes his glasses ou of his pocket and places them on his eyes, but over the napkin.
39) 40) dialog: Girls, we will not ask Amanda to crawl in the tent.
40) 0) text: The Girls enter with ease. Then Graham enters, bent over, then Amanda enters, barefoot.
40) 7) dialog: Can you please stop being so bossy.
40) 9) dialog: Very nice.
40) 12) dialog: (also staring up) Yeah, it's got something, doesn't it?
40) 22) dialog: Because you already smell good. (to Amanda) So do you, by the way.
40) 24) dialog: Exactly.
41) 0) text: Amanda waits. Graham comes down the stairs.
41) 1) dialog: I can't imagine anyone making a bigger hit with my children. They want to play dress up with you, do your hair, wear your shoes. They're already imitating your léugh.
41) 3) dialog: Thank you. Sophie has unfortunately taken on the role as my protector. She's brilliant but I hate when she worries about me and Olivia's gonna be a real ball buster... which I must admit I love about her.
41) 5) dialog: (with difficulty) Because I just don't ever... tell women about them.
41) 7) dialog: I was actually thinking of telling you earlier today, when we were having lunch.
41) 9) dialog: Why didn't I? Right. Well, I don't know. Something strange seems to happen when women find out I'm a widower with two little girls...it's some kind of weird aphrodisiac and it messes me up...and with you, I really didn't want to play the “poor me" card.
41) 11) dialog: (painfully explains) I have no defense except that until I know someone really well, it's easier for me to be just a normal single guy because it's way too complicated to be who I really am... because I am, in fact, anything Dut normal. I'm a full time Dad, I'm a working parent, I'm a mother and a father, I'ma guy who reads parenting books and cookbooks before I go to sleep. I spend my weekends buying tutus... I'm learning to sew. I'm on some kind of constant overload... So, I found it helps to compartmentalize my life, just until I figure this out. And so far, that's been alright... not that I see thet many (MORE)
41) 13) dialog: women, contrary to what you may think. This past weekend the girls were with their grandparents and when they're gone, I get to pretend I'm someone else. Someone without hot chocolate spilled on their trousers.... I don’t know how to date and be this. And there is the possibility that I'm petrified of what another person will do to who we are and how we get from one day to the next. I feel I'm a guy who can't make a mistake. Amanda takes that in and wonders if she would qualify as mistake.
41) 15) dialog: I didn't think I could introduce my kids to someone I may never see again.
41) 17) dialog: Actually I thought I was just someone you had sex with once and slept with twice. Neither one knows who's right.
41) 19) dialog: Well, like you said, I'm a book editor from London...you're a movie trailer maker from L.A. We're worlds apart. I have a cow in the backyard.
41) 21) dialog: Yes. I sew and I have a cow. How's that for hard to relate to? 85.
41) 23) dialog: Exactly. Which I believe may disqualify me from winning bachelor of the month. They both wait for the other to say something to make thi better.
41) 24) dialog: Well, anyway....thank you for being so sweet with the kids. I think it was eye opening for all three of us because they're absolutely right. We never do have grown ups here that ere girls.
41) 26) dialog: Good. Your visit may be the first step in pulling my odd little life together. So, really...thank you.

43) 2) dialog: Probably not.
43) 4) dialog: Well, she's just here on vacation. I don't think we'li get a chance to find out.
43) 6) dialog: Why?
43) 8) dialog: So do I.
50) 1) dialog: How's it going? You having fun?
50) 3) dialog: See. And you said you'd never... What's he like?
50) 5) dialog: Come on...
50) 7) dialog: Uh, yes, I have actually.
51) 12) dialog: How did she sound? How's she doing?
51) 14) dialog: What did you say?
51) 16) dialog: I'il hold while you speak to her.
51) 18) dialog: Find out how she is.
51) 25) dialog: (MORE)
51) 35) dialog: Is she still on the other line?
51) 37) dialog: I can't believe she told you and why are you embarrassed?
51) 39) dialog: Did she say we're not speaking? 96
51) 41) dialog: Good. No, I think we're just not seeing as much of each other. How much longer is she here or are you there? When does she leave?
51) 43) dialog: Really? Amazingly beautiful?
51) 45) dialog: (rising) dust about to get off the train and go home to the girls.
51) 48) dialog: Sorry. I happen to like her...perplexing as that is for me.
51) 52) dialog: Yes, but I don’t think she wants me to call. I'm pretty sure she doesn't.

57) 10) dialog: (equally thrilled) -- Yeah, you too.
57) 12) dialog: Yes. Please.
57) 14) dialog: sure. They all laugh as Graham takes the banquette seat alongsi Amanda. The girls sit across from Graham in chairs. They all sit awkwardly, given their proximity.
57) 15) dialog: (to Amanda) How are you?
57) 17) dialog: Sure. Thanks. Amanda scoots over and Graham sits next to her. The Girls across from them. GRAHAM (CONT’D) What should we have...what are you having?
57) 19) dialog: Couldn't interest you in lunch?

59) 1) dialog: So you're totally great. Fuck!

59) 5) dialog: New York?
59) 7) dialog: No. Rarely actually. (then) Long distance relationships can work you know.
59) 9) dialog: So, this could be a good solution for you.
59) 11) dialog: Not often... But you're your own boss...you can travel.
59) 14) dialog: Yes. That's do-able.
59) 18) dialog: Thank God.
59) 20) dialog: You're seriously the most depressing girl I ever met. I have another scenario for you.
59) 22) dialog: I'm in love with you. Did she hear him right?
59) 23) dialog: I apologize for the blunt delivery...but as problematical as this fact may be... I am in love. With you. And I'm not feeling this because you're leaving. And not because it makes me feel good to feel this way, which, by the way it does, or did, before you went off like that. I can't figure out the math of this thing, I just know I love you. IJ can't believe how many times I'm saying it...and I realize I come with a package deal, three for the price of one... and my package perhaps in the light of (MORE )

59) 27) dialog: I think if the scbvious response doesn't immediately come to you... then...well...we can just... We should just talk about something else. Like possibly what a complete ass I am. Amanda's chest tightens and hurts.
59) 28) dialog: As I recall, you did promise me you wouldn't fall in love with me.
59) 30) dialog: I guess I just wasn't listening.
67) 11) dialog: No we're not.
