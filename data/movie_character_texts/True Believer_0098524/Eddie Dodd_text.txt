A crew-cutted secretary (BILLY) types with one hand, grab the RINGING PHONE with the other. To judge by her typing telephone skills, she was hired for her capacity to manag this menagerie. Roger has struggled up the stairs, behind Eddie. Though h quickly notes the office's squalor and questionable clien what catches his eye is the trio of cracked and yellowing PHOTOGRAPHS tacked on a wall in the foyer.

50) 1) dialog: I'm a friend of Clyde Gruner's...
50) 6) text: Eddie and Roger turn. Behind them another Aryan Warrior h materialized. Chewing a Slim Jim.
50) 9) dialog: Who's Chuckie Roeder?
50) 11) text: Eddie and Roger trade glances.
50) 12) dialog: Do you know where he can be found?
50) 16) dialog: -- A job? An address?
50) 19) text: Teardrop shoots a look at Slim Jim. If looks could kill,  Slim Jim's brains would be decorating the walls. Teardrop turns back to Eddie and Roger.
50) 21) text: Instead Eddie steps forward, in Teardrop's face.
50) 22) dialog: A man jumped me tonight. He said he  was an Aryan Warrior, and you're  saying he wasn't. I have to hear it  really clear: You guys weren't behind  this.
50) 23) text: Very slowly, so Eddie gets it straight:
52) 1) dialog: At the main gate, that isn't open  yet. Eddie stands still, head bowed,  hands clasped behind his back. A  supplicant. Waiting to get in.
53) 0) text: Eddie and Shu are separated by a plexiglass pane. They ta over telephones. Shu strives to remain impassive as he HE
53) 1) dialog: Shu, the D.A.'s offered us a deal. I  can make a counter-offer I know he'd  accept. You'd be free in four years.
53) 4) text: Eddie worries his discolored jaw.
53) 5) dialog: An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops  painted on his face.
53) 7) text: Eddie nods.
53) 9) text: Eddie nods.
53) 10) dialog: But why would a guy would do that?  Paint black teardrops on his face?
53) 12) dialog: But why?
53) 14) dialog: Afraid of what?
53) 16) dialog: -- About what?
53) 18) dialog: What went down?
53) 20) dialog: No. You tell me, Shu.
53) 22) dialog: You can't. So tell me what you do  know -- say it!
53) 24) dialog: Well I know that you're innocent,  Shu -- even if you forgot.
53) 27) text: Tears are spilling down Shu's rock-hard cheeks. Eddie brings his palm up against the plexiglass divider.  He's breathing hard too.
53) 28) dialog: Shu. We take this deal, that's the  end. I don't look for the scumbag  that jumped me, don't get him on the  stand to tell the court who put him  up to it, don't go after the fuck  who put him up to it -- the fuck who  did the crime and let you do the  time... We take this deal, we walk  away without knowing what really  went down, never get a shot at nailing  some guilty bastard's balls to the  wall.
53) 31) dialog: "No," what?
53) 32) text: Now Shu raises his palm. Presses it against the plexiglas where Eddie's palm is. Slowly, emphatically:
54) 0) text: Hungry tourists, hyper street vendors, harried locals...  Roasting chicken carcasses, counterfeit merchandise  aggressively hawked, tiny old ladies bent over bins, sque strange fruits... The air a shivaree of piped-in flutes a drums, dissonant mercantile chatter, clogged honking  traffic... On Pell Street we FIND Eddie striding down the sidewalk,  nose in trial transcript. To himself:
54) 1) dialog: Jimmy came east on Pell. He stopped  on the corner to a let a car go by.
54) 2) text: Eddie stops.
54) 3) dialog: At the last instant he must've sensed  something. He turned --
54) 4) text: Eddie looks up from the text, turns his head. There's:
54) 7) text: Eddie adamantly shakes his head as he moves to Roger.
54) 8) dialog: But she couldn't have, could she,  because she thinks she saw Shu and  now we know she didn't see Shu...
54) 9) text: Roger looks dubious. Eddie grabs his shoulders, marching east on Pell, the way Jimmy Chin came...
54) 10) dialog: You're cruising along without a care  but now I'm stalking you, I'm right  behind you, there's rage in the air.  You feel the rage, like an electrical  charge -- you turn --
54) 12) dialog: I pull out a loaded gun --
54) 13) text: Eddie shapes the fingers of his right hand like a gun.
54) 14) dialog: -- Time contracts, space explodes,  perceptions can't be trusted when I --
54) 15) text: Eddie violently whips his finger-gun into Roger's face. R flinches -- we HEAR a shattering GUNSHOT -- and we're in:
55) 0) text: A forensic ballistics expert (GEORGE) has just test-fired Shu's gun into a long wooden box. He and Roger remove the ear-protectors. (Eddie hadn't bothered wearing one.) To R as he opens the box's lid:
55) 4) text: Eddie adamantly shakes his head.
55) 5) dialog: George -- I told ya -- ! We don't  need to finesse this one!
55) 9) dialog: My associate'll wait, George. I've  got good news of my own to deliver.
57) 1) dialog: This'll only take a minute.
57) 3) dialog: Then just leave word: Mr. Dowd and  Mr. Kim plan to proceed with trial.
58) 0) text: Grand, marbled. Eddie's footfalls ECHO as he lopes to the stairs. And now he hears a deep, sepulchral:
58) 4) text: Eddie ambles toward Reynard.
58) 5) dialog: I guess so, or you wouldn't be  standing there, am I right?
58) 9) dialog: Coke pushers pay cash. That subsidizes  the pot possession cases.
58) 12) dialog: But I'm a quick study. Tell your  Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll  see him in court.
58) 14) text: Eddie takes a beat to absorb the news. Then:
58) 15) dialog: Why am I surprised? It's consistent.
58) 17) dialog: You seem to have a talent for putting  non-whites behind bars...
58) 20) dialog: That's big of you, Bob.
58) 22) dialog: I'll see vou in court.
58) 25) text: Eddie hurriedly descends the stairs.
59) 3) dialog: The fuckin' D.A. himself.
60) 0) text: Eddie paces, gesticulates.
60) 1) dialog: Dude was quaking.
60) 4) dialog: George is a fucking burnout case. I  didn't want him on the stand anyway.  Get more names from Billy.
60) 5) text: Eddie turns to Kitty.
60) 6) dialog: Did you find me an expert witness on  the Joe Boys?
60) 9) text: Eddie levels a "So what are you telling me?" look at Kitt
60) 11) dialog: But I like that theory. And since  I'm not putting Twerp Professor on  the stand, and since I don't have a  better theory, I'm sticking with  that theory. Meantime I want pictures  of the Joes. What'll you bet there  was a guy in the gang looked enough  like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
60) 12) text: Kitty and Roger halfheartedly nod. Eddie tries a pep-talk
60) 13) dialog: Our guy is innocent. We prod in enough  places, I don't care how solid this  case against Shu looks -- there's a  weak spot somewhere and when we hit  it the whole hideous thing collapses.  Better yet, we get our hands on  Chuckie Roeder, we don't have to  grope in the dark. Chuckie is the  answer man!
60) 16) dialog: Have you considered that Chuckie  Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie  Roeder these days? Get his mugshot  from one of the many law officers  who've got hotpants for you... then  canvass those art supplies places.  We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but  ya gotta believe...
61) 0) text: Hung on a hundred hooks and nails are as many TIES. The w thrift-shop kind that Eddie wears to court. From a distan we can't distinguish the prints; the room is lit only by blinking neon across the street. As Roger sifts through t ties, we go in CLOSE on the big amoebas, the zaftig merma the oddball, dated patterns and paintings. It's as though each tie stands for a case won or lost, but fought. As th each loud, shameless tie is a piece of Eddie himself. Now, as he pulls the ties from their hooks to examine the Roger exposes old PHOTOS tacked to the wall and forgotten
63) 0) text: Eddie is alone in here, at the sink. He's just doused his face. He examines his reflection in the dirty mirror, try hard to like what he sees. HOLD for several silent BEATS Eddie gathers his strength and courage. Then:
64) 0) text: Eddie has now taken his seat beside Shu. Reynard is in th midst of his opening statement.
64) 5) dialog: Picture this. In a part of town that  thrives on its spirit of  celebration... good food, friendly  faces... one young man walked up to  another, out on the street, in front  of the tourists, and committed murder.
64) 6) text: As Eddie pivots, we see that his hair is pulled back with bright blue ribbon. The Jurors see this, too. If he didn' have it before, Eddie's now got their full attention.
64) 7) dialog: I wonder if Chinatown's shopkeepers  and restaurant owners pleaded with  the Mayor... I wonder if the Mayor  put pressure on the Police  Commissioner...
64) 8) text: Eddie jigs over to the jury box.
64) 9) dialog: What do you think the Mayor said to  the Police Commissioner? I think the  Mayor said, "Arrest somebody...
64) 11) dialog: ...ANYBODY!"
64) 19) dialog: Isn't it a fact that the "six other  Asian men" in the line-up were all  of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas  Shu has the distinct facial bone  structure of a Korean?
64) 21) dialog: Isn't it a standard trick to pack a  line-up with men who resemble each  other but look different than the  suspect, so the suspect will stand  out for the eyewitnesses?
64) 24) text: Eddie takes a beat, flashes another smile. Montell  reciprocates. Now Eddie shifts into his empathetic mode.
64) 25) dialog: You had to use less than scrupulous  methods, true? The Mayor was pushing  you hard for an arrest, wasn't he?
64) 26) text: Montell sadly shakes his head. As empathetic as Eddie:
64) 29) dialog: I was being metaphorical, Detective  Montell.
65) 1) dialog: Exactly what information led you to  arrest my client just two-and-a-half  hours after the shooting took place?
65) 3) dialog: A "description"? What, Asian male 18  to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
65) 7) dialog: You had intelligence...?
65) 10) dialog: Didn't this "information" come from  the Joe Boys themselves -- did they  not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a  Korean, an outsider?
65) 13) text: Eddie essays another line of attack.
65) 14) dialog: Isn't it unusual for a man who's  just committed a murder in plain  sight to bring the weapon back to  his apartment?
65) 19) dialog: Not at all --
65) 21) dialog: (hastily) Your Honor, the witness' response  was non-responsive... I ask you to  strike it from the record...!
65) 22) text: As Judge Quealy does just that, OS, Eddie backs away from the excitable detective.
65) 23) dialog: No more questions.
65) 26) text: Eddie sits. Wearing a confident grin for the benefit of a jurors who may be watching. Only Roger and Shu can HEAR:
65) 27) dialog: ...I'm dying out there.
65) 33) dialog: (sotto, to Roger) A fucking wheelchair?
67) 1) dialog: Detective Badalato. You reached the  County Coroner's and signed over the  body, when?
67) 4) text: Eddie opens his mouth, to continue his cross. But now his eyes dart to the jury box, and what comes out is:
67) 5) dialog: No more questions, your Honor.
68) 0) text: Eddie hurries past Reynard, in the rotunda, surrounded by REPORTERS. Looking well pleased with himself, the D.A. is engaged in a spontaneous, genial Q & A. Roger and Kitty catch up with Eddie, making for the exit.
68) 1) dialog: A fucking wheelchair?
68) 3) dialog: I don't have time to read every word  in every report, I'm too busy getting  killed in court... Meantime my  crackerjack investigator can't find  the goddam art supplies store where  Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
69) 2) text: Eddie tries not to look overly impressed.
69) 3) dialog: And I need an expert on the Joes I  can put on the goddam stand!
69) 6) text: She hops into an idling CAB. Eddie pulls a length of PIPE from the bag. He and Roger t baffled looks. Then Roger notices the PRINTING on the BAG

69) 14) dialog: Is "Art" around?
69) 17) dialog: No, but this won't take long.
69) 20) text: Eddie is abashed at her fine, radiant features. Roger tri not to stare.
69) 21) dialog: "Mariquilla"? It's a lovely name.
69) 27) dialog: Eddie Dowd.
69) 32) dialog: (pleasantly) I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking  about renovating. Everything dates  back to the Sixties.
69) 34) dialog: (to Roger) Do you see a toilet here you think  is really me?
69) 38) text: Eddie has slipped away. Hoping to distract Esparza:
69) 44) dialog: Freezes, for a beat -- then takes off down the length of conveyor belt... But the belt goes on and on, and so Eddi drops down and scuttles under it. As he gets to the other side and leaps up, he sees --
69) 46) dialog: gives chase, slipping on the contents of the spilled cart scores of loose spigots... Then he finds his footing, and races after Roeder down another:
69) 54) text: Muscular EMPLOYEES, brandishing pipe-wrenches, etc., have formed a menacing ring around Eddie.
69) 56) text: He starts briskly walking Eddie back to the front office.
69) 57) dialog: Look, I'm a lawyer and --
69) 59) dialog: "We"?
69) 63) dialog: Chuckie Roeder's a material witness  in a murder case, Mr. Esparza.
69) 68) dialog: Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
69) 71) dialog: Goddam it... the little punk bests  me again, I get thrown down and  lectured at and where the hell were  you?
69) 73) dialog: -- What?
69) 75) dialog: You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. (then) Nice.
70) 0) text: Eddie parks at a hydrant, the lawyers hop out. Eddie goes the trunk, forces it open, finds what he was looking for. Tucks the tire iron into his pants. Roger was already checking the addresses on this stretch lower East Side transient hotels and pawn shops.

71) 15) dialog: Boy, I was right about the distinctive  facial bone structure of a Korean. I  thought I was bullshitting.
71) 17) dialog: The odd man out always takes the  fall! Haven't I been saying all along  that --
71) 18) text: Suddenly aware that Kitty's watching him play Edward C. D Legendary Hell-For-Leather-Lawyer, he falters, embarrasse But Kitty's expression is affectionate, approving -- this just the spirit that drew her to Eddie years ago. Sensing this, Eddie relaxes. His voice softens.
71) 19) dialog: I haven't thanked you for your work,  Kitty. You're doing good work.
71) 21) dialog: (realizes) I haven't paid you.
71) 24) dialog: Got any booze in the house?
71) 26) dialog: You do.

Roger is off in a corner, giving a statement to Detective Eddie stands nearby, moodily contemplating the demise of last, best hope. OS, he HEARS:
75) 4) text: Eddie nods, not sure what to say. Esparza grimly regards  Roeder's corpse, then nods at Detective 1. A tear slides  down his cheek as the MORGUE TECH slams shut the drawer.  Esparza turns to Eddie. His voice thick:

76) 10) dialog: Hey -- you believe what you want.  Shu Kai Kim is innocent.

76) 13) text: Intoxicated by his illogic, Eddie yanks out his battered  wallet. Tugs out one of his two photos of Shu -- the "Sma Small World" snapshot from Mrs. Kim.
76) 14) dialog: It's not the face of a killer!
76) 17) dialog: (grim resolve) That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna  create reasonable doubt. Buckle your  seatbelt and watch me work.

77) 1) dialog: We need you in court. The jury'll be  swayed by your support. You men are  the backbone -- the conscience -- of  your community!
77) 2) text: The Pillars are unmoved. Eddie lightens up.
77) 3) dialog: Only people who've sat on my side of  the courtroom so far are a wino trying  to stay warm and a bail bondsman I  owe money to.
77) 5) dialog: C'mon, guys -- the dignity of your  race is being threatened here!
77) 9) text: The other Pillars nod. Eddie's gorge rises as they resume eating, sipping tea, quietly conversing in Cantonese.
77) 10) dialog: "A violent thug"? I happen to know  that two of you were once Joe Boys.
77) 12) dialog: But I'm not here to point the finger.  I did dumb things when I was 19 too --  we all did. Wrong time, wrong place,  everybody here could've made a perfect  fall guy instead of our lives turning  out how they did. This case is about  all of us. And you're gonna feel  like a bunch of goats when the truth  comes out.
77) 14) dialog: You'll kick yourselves for standing  on the sidelines while the D.A. made  you out to be fungible!

78) 25) dialog: The photo on the left shows the bullet  that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
78) 27) dialog: And the one on the right is the bullet  you test-fired from Shu's gun?
78) 29) text: Eddie contemplates these apparently identical photos. And manages to sound a note of outraged disbelief.
78) 30) dialog: You would have the court believe  that these two bullets were fired  from the same gun?
78) 32) text: Eddie presses the tip of the pointer to a thin smudge alo the lower edge of the right bullet.
78) 33) dialog: I see a groove here. I don't see a  groove here.
78) 36) text: Eddie's pointer finds another mark on the rear of the rig bullet. Or maybe it's the shadow cast by the pointer.

78) 39) dialog: Or this -- is this a significant  difference?

78) 45) dialog: Forensic ballistics isn't an exact  science, is it?
78) 47) dialog: Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent  margin of error?
78) 49) dialog: In other words, seven times out of a  hundred, you're wrong!
80) 10) dialog: Ms. Gordon. I have studied the  diagrams and the photographs and I  have visited the murder scene and  the conclusion I keep reaching is...  and I hate to have to say this...  You weren't even close enough to see  the killer's gun.

82) 11) dialog: By trusting me. Shit, man...
82) 13) dialog: I got my face kicked 'cause I trusted  you. I couldn't find an expert to  say it wasn't your gun killed Jimmy  Chin but it didn't matter... I went  up against the goddam D.A. himself  but I didn't care because I trusted  you, because I believed in you,  because I thought there was a bond  between us!
82) 14) text: Like a spurned lover who can't let go, Eddie implores Shu through the plastic:

89) 34) dialog: Everyone else was wrong and the one  fucking lunatic was right!
90) 1) dialog: (quiet intensity) But Shu's gun is an absolute match...!  How could that be, goddammit?

102) 10) dialog: I suppose I could find an inmate  who'd say that Shu boasted about  Chinatown just to survive in the  joint -- though he didn't really do  it...
102) 13) dialog: I guess I could find witnesses to  dispute every point made by the D.A.  But in the end, would we be any closer  to understanding what really happened  eight years ago? As Mr. Reynard has  said, these matters are cloaked in  secrecy... How can we, here in the  safety and sanctity of this court,  presume to pass judgment on Shu Kai  Kim, a refugee...
102) 18) dialog: I would like to put Shu's alleged  crime in a context, your Honor. And  we do have the foremost expert on  prison and street gangs right here  in this room... If it please the  court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.

102) 37) dialog: Didn't this investigation, with its  attendant publicity, catapult you  into the office you now hold?
102) 40) dialog: Did you do any hands-on work or did  you just supervise, from on high?

102) 44) dialog: His expression gives away nothing.
102) 47) dialog: The same three detectives on the  Jimmy Chin case.
102) 50) dialog: And who was Arturo Esparza?
102) 53) dialog: -- But you just said you were  personally involved with all the  principals of the investigation.
102) 55) dialog: I didn't say he was an informant.  But since you mentioned it, wasn't  Esparza your primary informant?
102) 57) text: Heedless, Eddie hammers at him.
102) 58) dialog: Isn't it true that without Esparza,  you had no investigation?
102) 60) dialog: I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
102) 61) text: Eddie moves in closer.
102) 62) dialog: On the night of November 2, 1980,  did Art Esparza phone you at home to  say, "I just killed a man in Chinatown --  people saw me do it"?
102) 65) dialog: No? Then what did he say?
102) 69) dialog: You'd worked too hard to let Esparza's  crime of passion spoil everything.  You ordered your team to comb through  the mugbooks. Find a patsy. Frame  him. (beat) Protect your case. (beat) Protect your career. Isn't that so?
102) 76) dialog: Putting away one punk enabled you to  keep your informant out of prison  and in place.
102) 78) dialog: By keeping your informant out of  prison and in place, you were able  to complete your work. Ultimately  you saved scores of lives, didn't  you?
102) 79) text: No answer. Now Eddie invokes the D.A.'s pet principle:
102) 80) dialog: It was a trade-off, wasn't it?
102) 83) text: Eddie nods. Then returns to the defense table and sits,  between Roger and Shu. Eddie looks drained but exalted. H can sleep now.
102) 84) dialog: The defense rests.
104) 2) text: Edward C. Dowd lounges against his Riviera. Shu cocks his head, stares at the lawyer. Eddie shrugs, stares down. Three beats. When he looks up Shu is standing before him. Searching for words. Failing find them. At last:
104) 3) dialog: Shit, man -- let's get out of here.
