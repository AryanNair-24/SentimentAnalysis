12) 13) dialog: You know it. David moves on... WE FADE TO BLACK and bring up a TITLE CARD:
13) 52) dialog: (mutters to himself) Aw, jeez... A few people draw away from Mrs. Carmody, avoiding her. T vibe is turning panicky, and she’s not helping things. So bumps into David, almost jolting him off his feet, more p heading outside, as Norton whispers to David:
13) 75) dialog: Is everybody okay? Is anybody hurt? Everybody starts breathing again, some sobbing in fear. B starts crying hysterically. David sets him down, trying t quiet him, as tension spills out all over the store:
13) 85) dialog: Ma'am, no, you can't go out there. Not until we catch our breath and figure things out--
14) 7) dialog: Boy settled down? How is he? 2.
14) 9) dialog: I'll go fetch some aspirin, huh?
14) 11) dialog: Got some furniture pads out in the loading dock.
14) 29) dialog: David! Jesus!
14) 31) dialog: What, the generator? We were just coming to check it out... Norm the bag boy appears with flashlights, ready to hand out. David's freaked, trying to calm down:
14) 37) dialog: Nobody's calling you a liar.

14) 93) dialog: Ollie lets go of Norm, rushes to the wall, and SLAMS his hard as he can into the glass case -- it doesn't break, b his elbow almost does. He hisses in pain, clutching it...

More tentacles are slithering past them, exploring -- a h one ripples by them like a gigantic boa constrictor, prob the pallets of goods. It grabs a 50 pound bag of dog food Squeezes, exploding dry kibble all over the room. Other tentacles descend, mindlessly scarfing it up... David and Ollie are whining with effort and terror, the l door buckling and groaning from the pressure. Norm is gaz up at them, whimpering, head whipping from side to side a to deny that he's being eaten alive, moaning: 39.
14) 101) dialog: 
14) 110) dialog: Don't, David. Don't-hit him anymore. It doesn't solve anything.
14) 113) dialog: Good. Good. What's next? 41.

15) 62) dialog: Fine, Bud, write down your names, but in the meantime, shut the fuck up. And listen. Bud reacts as if slapped, stunned that Ollie just spoke t him like that. Bud glances to David -- go ahead. David hesitates, all eyes now on him.
15) 72) dialog: You honestly think he’s hiding? Having a laugh at your expense? Is that what you truly think, Bud? ANGLE TO Amanda and Sally, Irene and Hattie. Sally's got arms protectively around Billy. Everybody waiting, listen
15) 83) dialog: (takes her elbow) That's enough now, Mrs. Carmody . That's just fine.
17) 2) dialog: What about the fourth? I guess that would make me a flat-out liar.
17) 4) dialog: Tell you what, Mr. Norton. Why don't you go out that door and around back? There's a big pile of return bottles Norm and I put out there this morning. You bring back one of those bottles...even one...I'11 take off my shirt and eat it.
17) 8) dialog: Leave it alone, David. You can't convince some people there's a fire even if their hair is burning. Denial is a powerful thing.

17) 105) dialog: You stare at something long enough, your eyes play tricks on you.
19) 15) dialog: There are things moving around out there.
19) 17) dialog: Shadows. Things in the mist. (off David's look) i'm not drunk. I've been trying, believe me. Wish I could. 1 thought my eyes were playing tricks, but Dan saw it too. So did Arnie Simms. Ollie tosses a careful look over his shoulder at Mrs. Car She's. sitting by herself, eating chicken Yavenously with hands, surrounded by bones like some cannibal queen.

20) 22) dialog: It's Joe. If we don't get him on some serious antibiotics, he'll die of infection. Plus he needs painkillers in the worst way. Pain’s So bad he's asking for the gun. . (off their grim looks) All we have here is aspirin and liquor.
20) 24) dialog: They've got Silvadene, the stuff they use in burn wards. Plus bandages, penicillin, oxycontin...
20) 45) dialog: I fired two. That leaves ten.
20) 48) dialog: He's right. The flakier people get, the better she's gonna look.
20) 57) dialog: With what? The Holocaust? Rwanda? The Inquisition? 9-11? Read the papers, Mike. As a species, we're fundamentally insane. You get more than two of us in a room together, we start dreaming up reasons to kill one another. Why do you think we invented politics and religion?

23) 14) dialog: He died of his burns while you were asleep. We were too late. David absorbs this, glances up at Mrs. Carmody's voice.
23) 24) dialog: Yeah. Seems to be her growth stock. David struggles to his feet, still a bit woozy.
23) 27) dialog: You may have to reconsider. yu. They exit the aisle, find Myron LaFleur and Dan Miller wa Mrs. Carmody from a distance.

24) 3) dialog: Groceries are hidden at the first checkout stand. Five bags. We can grab them and be out the door.
24) 25) dialog: in a shooter's stance, Amanda's gun held in a two-handed smoke drifting from the barrel.
