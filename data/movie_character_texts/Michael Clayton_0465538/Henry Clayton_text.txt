He’s feeding SOPHIA, their eighteen-month old daughter.

22) 2) dialog: (scrounging around) Dad’s down there waiting already.
22) 4) dialog: (Ivy staring at him) Yes. I had a waffle. Ivy Since we’re out of waffles I don’t see how that’s possible.
22) 5) dialog: (rushing off) It’s a miracle. IVY about to fire back. GERALD waving her off. Let it go. Feed the baby. Save your strength. 18
24) 1) dialog: ...80 no one’s even sure exactly where they are because there’s no border or landmarks or anything...
24) 3) text: MICHAEL driving. HENRY shotgun.
24) 4) dialog: ...and the town, it’s not even a town, really, it’s just like this camp where these people have gathered to hide, right? All these deserters and guys that got cut off from their armies, all these people that were hiding in the woods and trying to stay alive, this is where they all came. There’s Thieves, Gray Mages, Unbidden Warriors, Dark Avians, Riverwynders, Sappers -- there’s like fifteen kinds of characters, okay?
24) 6) dialog: So basically you have all these characters who don’t know each other and they don’t know why they’re here and nobody has any alliances, okay? Whatever alliances you had before are gone. You can’t even say who you are, because you don’t know, maybe the person you’re talking to, maybe they were like your mortal enemy in the wars. So it’s just completely like everybody for themselves. 19

41) 21) dialog: Except this is like a whole bunch of people having the same dream. They’re all having this dream that they should go to this one place. They don’t know why or anything, they just have this feeling that they have to go there.
41) 23) dialog: That’s the chapter! That’s what it’s called. “Summons to Conquest.” Seriously, that’s the title.
42) 2) dialog: No, that’s what’s so cool, they all think it’s just them, that maybe they’re like going crazy or something so they don’t want to admit it.
42) 4) dialog: No, it’s real. It’s really happening.
42) 6) dialog: -- yeah, but then later they do, so if you’re gonna read it, I don’t want to spoil it -- (stopping because--) 41 GERALD (stepfather) standing at the bedroom doorway.
