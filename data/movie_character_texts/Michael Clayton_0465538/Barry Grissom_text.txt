2) 1) text: BARRY GRISSOM coming around the table. He’s maybe fifty. A killer New York lawyer in his prime. Litigator. Senior partner. Always wrapped a little tight and this moment is no exception -- slowing now and...
2) 2) dialog: (kneeling, whispering) I’ve got that cunt from the Wall Street Journal on line eight. I told her you were in Bermuda, but I’d try to patch you in... MARTY BACH looks up from his papers. He’s seventy. It’s his name on the door. Big power. Sweet eyes. A thousand neckties. A velvet switchblade.
31) 4) dialog: ...Jesus...Jesus...Jesus... (listening) ...this was...oh, Jesus...Jesus... (each pause more painful) +.-Jesus...oh, Jesus... (looking up and--) ...hang on -- (a savior) -- there you are! MICHAEL in the doorway. All eyes rushing to him --
31) 6) dialog: Arthur Edens just stripped down naked in a deposition room in Milwaukee.
51) 10) text: A SILVER FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. Young Arthur Edens with his wife and baby daughter. Some faded happy moment. This one of several very traditional items, on a very traditional desk. In fact the whole place is almost disturbingly repressed. The only thing out of place are the dozens of document boxes piled at the center of the room. MARTY and BARRY GRISSOM digging through all of it. Like they've been at it a while.
51) 16) dialog: (thanks for nothing) So basically, he could be anywhere... MICHAEL bites his tongue. No love lost with Barry. 52
51) 18) dialog: Where’s his daughter?
51) 22) dialog: You’ve got to saddle up here, Michael, and get this under control.
51) 24) dialog: He needs to be under a doctor’s care immediately. He needs to be admitted.
51) 26) dialog: Does it matter?
51) 29) dialog: Why the hell not?
51) 31) dialog: Did you see this fucking tape?
90) 0) text: BARRY pacing on a cell phone outside. He sees MICHAEL approaching and --
90) 1) dialog: (into the phone) -- hang on -- just hang on -- (to Michael) There you are... BARRY finds a sad face. Throws out a hand. MICHAEL joins this little dance of grief.
90) 2) dialog: ...we've been waiting for you... they’re all in there, I’11 be in... MICHAEL nods. Pulls away and --
92) 0) text: BARRY still on his phone call --
92) 1) dialog: (pacing and talking--) ...I’m not gonna start negotiating against myself, if he’s got a number he likes he’s gonna have to back it up. I’m not getting U/North all fired up if he doesn’t have his people in line...
93) 11) dialog: Marty? BARRY behind them.
93) 12) dialog: We need to get up to the office.
93) 14) dialog: In principle. Don Jeffries wants us on the phone in half an hour. (including Michael in this now--) I tried to explain about Arthur. They’re a little short on sympathy at this point. 91
93) 16) dialog: They think there’s a window. They want to try. (just the messenger) It’s their show. What’re we gonna do? MICHAEL stunned. Silent.
93) 18) dialog: You need a ride?
113) 6) dialog: (on a mobile phone in the middle of it all--) -- so either we cap the interest on the primary trust or somebody figures out how to split the custody fees -- (spotting Michael) -- the audit’s mandatory, right? -- (covering the phone, calling back over his shoulder--) -- Marty! -- (then the phone- -- no, just hang on (then to Michael--) -- he’s been looking for you -- (then back to the phone, as--)
113) 15) text: If you say so. (checking his watch) We’ve been here all night. We had to make an announcement. (turning now--) Jean! Jeannie! (calling to his Assistant across the way--) Where’s the thing? The envelope? (back to Michael) So I wanted your input, but I couldn’t get you and I had to pull the trigger. I put Bob Nast and Kim -- which is probably a mistake -- they’re gonna try to pull together a memorial service by the end of the week. I told them to call you if they need help, okay? (distracted now because Jean’s holding something up for him to see--) -- no, no, the other one -- (back to Michael) So we cut a check for you this morning, but there’s some strings attached. And Barry, there’s no way around it, he’s got to be involved.
113) 24) dialog: (the envelope) You’re doing this now?
113) 26) dialog: Almost. They're proofing. (to Michael) ) Look, I agreed to this, okay? But there’s rules now. You want the contract, you’re signing a confidentiality agreement and it’s gonna be retroactive and it’s gonna be bulletproof. Because Marty’s too nice to say it, but with everything you know about this place and the clients and the people who work here, it makes things just a little too weird when you come in and ask for eighty grand. A nasty beat. MICHAEL stung. Roiling.
113) 27) text: If I was gonna shake anybody down, Barry, I’d come right to you. And it wouldn’t be for eighty grand. (to Marty) Is this him or you?
113) 28) dialog: Hey, if I’m wrong, I apologize.
113) 30) dialog: So there you go.
156) 2) dialog: (finally) I‘1l tell him....of course...you too...1’11 check back. And now he’s hanging up the phone. Turning to the room.
156) 3) dialog: We have a deal. A beat. And then someone starts to clap. And someone else And then they’re all APPLAUDING -- MARTY -- DON JEFFRIES BARRY -- happy warriors all -- and as the backslapping an smiles keep building.
