Father of a ten-year-old boy’s face. A face women like more than they know why. The good soldier’s face. THE ID CARD just one of several objects sitting at the bottom of a shitty plastic basket. Also here: one roll of breath mints, two mobile phones, business cards, too many keys on a Mercede security pendant keychain, and one heavy-duty steel Rolex

12) 5) dialog: They’11l have to take a look at that.
12) 7) dialog: Mr. Greer, we don’t have a great deal of time to work with here. MR. GREER’s anxiety sharpening. Arrogance under siege.
12) 9) dialog: What interests me right now is finding the strongest criminal attorney that can get here in the next fifteen minutes. 11
12) 11) dialog: We have some good relationships up here in Westchester.
12) 13) dialog: Not the kind you need.
12) 15) dialog: You need a trial lawyer. Someone to see this all the way through. That’s not what I do. There it is. And MR. GREER doesn’t like it one bit.
12) 17) dialog: Sir... (cut the crap) We don’t have time for Walter. Your options here, they’re gonna get smaller very quickly.
12) 19) dialog: I’m suggesting you go local. I’m telling you there’s several people up here I like for this.
12) 22) dialog: Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident on a slow weeknight, six miles from the State Police barracks. Believe me, if there’s a line, you're right up front.

Tomorrow morning they’re gonna be looking for the owner of a custom- color, hand-rubbed, green Mercedes SL 500. This guy you hit, if he got a look at the plate, it won’t even take that long. Like that -- THE PHONE RINGS -- harsh -- sudden --
12) 33) dialog: (ignoring the phone) There’s no play here. There’s no angle. There’s no champagne room. And I’m not a miracle worker, I’ma janitor. So the math on this is simple: the smaller the mess, the easier it is for me to clean up. THE PHONE STILL RINGING and --
12) 35) dialog: No. They don’t call. (calmly picking up--) Hello? (beat) Jerry. Hey, it’s Michael... (pause) Yeah, sorry. I’m in the neighborhood. You got a pen? MICHAEL on hold. Silence now. MR. AND MRS. GREER parked like glaciers. Broken glass in the sink. 14

Walking slowly into the field. Behind him, the MERCEDES with the engine running. THE HORSES aware of him now. Watching him come. MICHAEL’S FACE as he walks. And later on we’1ll understan all the forces roiling inside him, but for the moment, th simplest thing to say is that this is a man who needs mor 16 than anything to see one pure, natural thing, and by some miracle has found his way to this place. The wet grass an cold air and no coat -- none of it makes any difference t him right now -- he’s a pilgrim stumbling into the cathed And he stops. Just standing there. Empty. Open. Lost. Nothing but the field and the fog and the woods beyond. THE HORSES staring at him. MICHAEL staring back. And just like that...

24) 17) dialog: Go. (snagging a quick kiss) Go on. Teach these people something. HENRY getting out of the car. MICHAEL watching his son lu his backpack down the sidewalk and into the school.

I mean, the fixtures are gone, but the bar, the kitchen, it’s great space... MICHAEL listening and it’s not the answer he was hoping f And he’s pacing around, taking us toward the bedroom door One open, the other one closed.

Windows to Central Park and The Westside twenty stories below. A slick pad. Small but clean, furnished efficiently, and the view is sharp. BRINI starts the microwave. There’s a roach in an ashtray on the counter. She lights it. Taking a drag, as MICHAEL wanders in from the bedroom.

59) 1) dialog: ...There’s a chemical part of this, and you know it, and I know it, and if you're ready to start with that, then I’m more than willing to meet you halfway and cop to the fact that, yes, the situation sucks. The case sucks. U/North sucks. We can start with that...
61) 1) dialog: ...but we came to this, Arthur, we had choices. It didn’t just happen overnight. You can’t just suddenly say, “Hey, sorry. Game over. I’m into miracles now.” (suddenly) Goddamit, Arthur, pick up the fucking phone and talk to me! Whatever the hell else you think is so important right now, you better let me help you on this, because I’m telling you straight up here, janitor to janitor, I don’t see anybody else with a broom on the horizon.
