As he proceeds, he keeps checking t camera image to make sure every object is returned to its original position. This is raw space. A box. High ceilings. Industrial windows along one wall. Half-assed groupings of furniture define the space: Bed and dresser, desk and computer, 58 bathroom and closets framed out along the far walls. The decor is odd. Half the stuff is clearly from a previo life; Eastside antiques, proper rugs, generic oil landsca piled carelessly around.

If your intention was to have me committed, you should've kept me in Wisconsin where the arrest record, videotape, and eyewitness accounts of my inappropriate behavior had jurisdictional relevance. I have no criminal record in the State of New York and the crucial determining criteria for involuntary commitment is danger: “Is the defendant a danger to himself or others.” You think you’ve got the horses for that?
