2) 3) dialog: (punching up line eight) Marty Bach. How can I help you?
2) 5) dialog: The case you’re referring to, is now, as it has been for the past six years, pending and unresolved. Until our client has their day in court or the plaintiffs come to their senses and drop the suit, I’1l have nothing of value to tell you. BARRY kneeling there, hanging on every word --
2) 7) dialog: Here’s what I know: your deadline was twenty minutes ago, so either you’re fishing for a story or trying to get out of writing a retraction. In either case, I wish you well...best of luck... (as he hangs up--) -.-Sweet dreams.
2) 9) dialog: (scanning the room) Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?
51) 6) dialog: That’s really Don’s signature? (she nods) Where’s the original?
51) 8) dialog: How does this end up in Arthur’s bag?
51) 10) text: A SILVER FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. Young Arthur Edens with his wife and baby daughter. Some faded happy moment. This one of several very traditional items, on a very traditional desk. In fact the whole place is almost disturbingly repressed. The only thing out of place are the dozens of document boxes piled at the center of the room. MARTY and BARRY GRISSOM digging through all of it. Like they've been at it a while.
51) 11) dialog: I want all this -- everything here -- I want it all boxed up and sent to my apartment. MICHAEL in the doorway. Watching them plunder. Until --
51) 12) dialog: (without looking back) Any luck, Michael? BARRY turns, surprised. MICHAEL steps into the office.
51) 14) dialog: You try his place?
51) 17) dialog: Arthur downtown was not a good idea. Some goddam loft?
51) 20) dialog: Mars. (putting down the photograph--) She’s crazier than he’1l ever be. (to Michael) Barry’s going to take over on U/North. We've all got a lot of grovelling to do with these people. (pointedly) You didn’t exactly charm Karen Crowder.
51) 27) dialog: Michael... (the voice of reason) U/North needs to know that he’s under control. That he’s in a facility. They’ve been shaken up, they need to be reassured.
51) 33) dialog: You know what? We’ve got six hundred attorneys in this building. Let’s find out which one of them knows the most about psychiatric commitment statutes.
66) 0) text: The grand parlor floor. Everything perfect except for the TWO DOZEN DOCUMENT BOXES piled around the room. On the si of each box, the word EDENS and a number. MARTY poring ov paperwork.
66) 2) dialog: You know what he’s doing? He’s making their case... (the boxes) I’m going through his files, I’m eee eT CMORE ) " 65 MARTY (cont'd) reading this...he’s building a case against U/North.
66) 4) dialog: Let him? (furious) Who’s gonna stop him? You know what I just heard? He’s calling these plaintiffs now -- this woman from the deposition? -- he’s calling these people -- he’s got these discovery documents stashed away here... (he’s stunned) It’s a fucking nightmare. I’ve been trying him all morning, you can’t even leave a message, he’s got the whole machine jammed up. MICHAEL watching him pull another bunch of files from a b
66) 6) dialog: Yeah. Why?
66) 8) dialog: I don’t know. It came up with all the stuff from his office. (lying effortlessly) You can’t believe the crap he’s got stashed away in here. MICHAEL nods. Accepting this. Plus there’s another agenda he’d like to get to here.
66) 10) dialog: I thought you were done with all that. 66
66) 12) dialog: Eighty thousand?
66) 14) dialog: Nothing’s final.
66) 16) dialog: Everybody knows how valuable you are, Michael. Everybody who needs to know.
66) 18) dialog: Nobody told you to go into the bar business.
66) 20) dialog: I had no idea you were so unhappy.
66) 22) dialog: Anybody can go to court. You think that’s so special?
66) 24) dialog: So what? So are a lot of people. At this -- what you do -- at this, you’re great. For crissake, Michael, you have what everybody wants; you have a niche. You made a place, you made this niche for yourself. And if it’s nostalgia -- “Oh, you should’ve seen me when I was a D.A. back in Queens.” -- then let me give you a serious piece of advice: Leave it there. God forbid you’re not as good as you remember. Because I’ve seen that happen too.
66) 26) dialog: So this is what? Quid pro quo?
66) 28) dialog: I give you the loan or you don’t help out with Arthur?
66) 30) dialog: Maybe you should. Because this... (Arthur’s papers) This is cancer. This is something we don’t get it reined-in and cleaned up soon, everything’s vulnerable. Everything.
66) 32) dialog: That I’m counting on you. (the grand gesture) I’m telling you that by this time next week Arthur will be under control
66) 35) dialog: When the fuck did you get so delicate? MICHAEL left hanging, no chance to respond, because here THE KIDS -- running up the stairs -- SQUEALING AND SCREAM -- chasing each other into the room and --
66) 36) dialog: -- there you are! -- (making a playful grab--) -- into the lion’s den! -- gotcha! -- MICHAEL standing there rocked, as MARTY starts roaring at the kids and they start squealing even louder and --
91) 0) text: Dark. Funky. Somebody’s favorite joint. MARTY BACH and HALF-A-DOZEN OTHER ATTORNEYS clotted at the bar. These gu all partners at the firm. Everyone dressed in their Sunda night come-as-you-are tragedy clothes. MICHAEL moves down the line. A grim, quiet gauntlet of mumbled hellos and handshakes. MARTY, truly grief-stricke half-drunk, shaky as he comes off his stool to gather MIC into his arms.
91) 1) dialog: (as they embrace) ...that stupid bastard... 89
91) 3) dialog: ...what a thing...
91) 5) dialog: I never even got to talk to him.
93) 0) text: Forty-five minutes later. MICHAEL and MARTY alone now.
93) 2) dialog: Not a chance.
93) 4) dialog: What? You scared him to death? (ridiculous) The man was a bull. Never happen.
93) 6) dialog: It’s got to be an accident. No note? Arthur without a note? Guy couldn’t take a piss without leaving a memo. It has to be an accident. 90
93) 8) dialog: Why? Because people are fucking incomprehensible. Why... (waving the idea away) You live this long, you’re supposed to get something out of it. What did I get? I’m still horny and vain and afraid to die. What do I know about anything? (he drinks) Thirty years I know Arthur. Good years. And what I feel right now? If I’m honest? I can’t even say it it’s so awful.
93) 10) dialog: We did, didn’t we? MICHAEL nods. They turn.
93) 13) dialog: They accepted?
93) 17) dialog: You did what you could, Michael. We all did. (draining his drink) It is what it is. BARRY helping MARTY off the stool. Holding his coat.
113) 9) dialog: Your phone is off. There’s too much going on for your phone to be off.
113) 11) dialog: (impatient, tired) Yeah well, now we’re late, so...
113) 13) dialog: What’d you do? Close the place? You look like hell.
113) 17) dialog: What do you mean? Onto what? MICHAEL hesitating because here’s JEAN, tapping her watch MARTY to hurry up as she hands him A SMALL GRAY ENVELOPE
113) 19) dialog: Right about what? That we're on the wrong side?
113) 21) dialog: This is news? We’re defending cancer for crissake. The case reeked from Day One. Fifteen years in, I’ve got to tell you how we pay the rent?
113) 23) dialog: What would they do? Are you fucking soft? They’re doing it! (honestly incredulous) We don’t straighten this settlement out in the next twenty-four hours, they’re gonna withhold nine million dollars in fees they owe us. Then they’re gonna pull out the video of Arthur’s flashdance in Milwaukee and sue us for legal malpractice, except there won’t be anything to win because by that point the merger with London will be dead and we'll be selling off the furniture. (handing Michael the envelope now--) That’s eighty. We’re calling it a bonus. You’re getting a three year contract at your current numbers. That’s assuming this all works out. And now, before MICHAEL can get his footing, here comes -
113) 25) dialog: (the documents) Are they ready?
113) 27) text: If I was gonna shake anybody down, Barry, I’d come right to you. And it wouldn’t be for eighty grand. (to Marty) Is this him or you?
113) 31) dialog: Enough. Okay? Everybody. (to Michael) He’s an asshole. But he knows it. (to Barry) And you’re on the record. Okay? (to both) Everybody happy? Nobody’s happy. And here’s JEAN with a nudge --
113) 33) dialog: Okay, we’re coming... (to Barry) Tell them to bring the paperwork down when they’re ready. (to Michael) Call Bob Nast, just see if they need help with this thing... (starting to walk away, then he stops, turns back--) You’re welcome. MICHAEL standing there, with THE ENVELOPE in one hand and THE RED BOOKLET in the other. Standing there watching MAR and BARRY hustle away. All the power, all the oxygen, leaving with them. The moment passing, as --
