14) 1) dialog: What the hell was going on up there? We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in o corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beau
14) 3) dialog: That guy's an asshole, huh? Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the bathroom.
14) 5) dialog: Sam and I are going to grab a bite after she's finished with--

14) 41) text: (Honest and vulnerable.) I need the money. SYLVIA
14) 43) text: What do you want me to say? My health lasted longer than the money... Go figure that out. Riggan seems pensive and lost. SYLVIA
14) 47) text: I have a chance to do something right. And I have to take it. I have to. SYLVIA
14) 50) text: Why did we break up? SYLVIA
14) 51) text: (Looks him in the eye.) You threw a kitchen knife at me... Riggan is smacked by that memory. His eyes on the floor. SYLVIA (CONT'D)
14) 52) text: ...and one hour later you were telling me how much you loved me. (Beat.) Just because I didn't like that ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie Hawn didn't mean I did not love you. But that's what you always do. You confuse love with admiration. She smiles sadly. He looks at her. As Sylvia opens the do she turns back to Riggan...
14) 55) dialog: It's your house, so do what you want with it. Just make sure you're there for our daughter.
14) 57) dialog: You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan. She exits. Painful silence... until...
47) 0) text: ... that the room is full of roses and cards. Riggan lies the sofa, hugging a cushion. He is wearing the long wig a mustache for the motel scene. Sylvia appears in the doorway.

47) 14) text: I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of the day observing how beautifully this pile of dirty clothes was lit by the warm afternoon sun. (A tiny smile.) So beautiful. Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan' meditation posture. SYLVIA
47) 16) text: You know? I have this voice that talks to me and tells me the truth. It's comforting, and scary. A beat. SYLVIA

47) 20) text: You wanna hear something funny? SYLVIA
47) 22) text: Do you remember our last anniversary party? SYLVIA

47) 32) text: I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach for a while. Just... staring out at the ocean. SYLVIA
47) 34) text: Until I walked straight into the water and tried to drown myself. Silence. Sylvia stares at Riggan, surprised. RIGGAN (CONT'D)
47) 35) text: I was in up to my chest when I felt the first one. On my back, like somebody was holding a frying pan against me. And then my chest, and my legs. The water was full of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the water, and I started rolling around the sand like a maniac... crying. Sylvia doesn't know how to react. SYLVIA
47) 41) text: I love you. And I love Sam. SYLVIA
47) 43) text: I never should have video taped Sam's birth. First of all because you and Sam both look like shit in that video. But mostly because I missed the moment. I should have just been there with the two of you. Present in my own life. So I'd have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of it. SYLVIA
47) 45) text: No, I don't. SYLVIA
47) 47) text: No, I understand. She needed a father and she got one shamefully successful youtube video. Pretty pathetic. SYLVIA
47) 49) text: Places for act two. Places. SYLVIA
47) 51) text: You should get back to your seat. You don't want to miss what's next. Sylvia lingers for a moment, and not knowing what to say, exits. Riggan opens a drawer and takes out a black case.

52) 1) text: Is he...? SYLVIA
52) 3) text: (Serious.) I thought I lost you, buddy. Thank god you're a horrible shot! What the hell happened? I was watching you up on that stage, and all of a sudden you get that goofy look in your eye, and you were just like-- He starts to laugh. SYLVIA
52) 9) text: You did it. SYLVIA
52) 11) text: (To Sylvia.) Read it. He hands her the newspaper. She begins to read to herself SYLVIA
52) 19) text: He's got a new nose! And if he doesn't like that one, we'll get him another one. We can use Meg Ryan's guy. Who gives a shit? Turn on the tv. There are people praying for him all over the country. They're lighting candles in Central Park. He did it. (To Riggan) You did it! The play's gonna run forever. It's gonna open in London, in Paris... The studios will call us again. We'll get book offers. SYLVIA
52) 28) text: (Chasing him out.) This is a hospital you motherfucker! Jake rushes to the door, shoving the newsman and a few ot paparazzi out the door. Security guards. Chaos. Finally silence. Sylvia steps up and looks Riggan in the eye. SYLVIA
52) 29) text: Is that what it was? An accident? Riggan just stares at her. His calm, sad eyes peeking thr the bandages. After a moment his gaze moves over her shoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in th doorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward silence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone. She kisses Sam on the head and exits. Sam walks the flowe to Riggan at the bed. She lays them on his chest. SAM
54) 0) text: ...the room. He looks around, but Sam is gone. He ambles to the window, his ass hanging out of the back of his hospital robe. He opens the window and feels the sun and breeze on his swollen face. We just hear the sounds of th people standing down in the parking lot. Media trucks. Fa We stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about something. He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky. T he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins step up onto the sill. The camera pans away from him to a table that has some ph propped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. On with Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver's "What we talk Abo When We Talk About Love" laying on the surface. The camera continues to pan until it comes to the door. S enters with a small vase. She looks around... SAM
