0) 5) dialog: With every sun comes a new day. A new beginning. A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.
0) 9) dialog: But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is my family, the Croods. If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark. Night after night, day after day. Yep. Home sweet home. When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world. And I struggled to survive my family.
0) 11) dialog: We were the last ones around. There used to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs, common cold. And, the Croods. That's us. The Croods made it...
0) 14) dialog: Because of my Dad. He was strong... and he followed the rules.
0) 18) dialog: ... the ones painted on the cave walls. Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad. Basically, anything fun is bad. Welcome to my world.
0) 22) dialog: But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.
0) 29) dialog: Because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end. And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.
0) 46) dialog: We've been in that cave forever.
0) 50) dialog: It is with this family.
1) 15) dialog: Heads.
1) 48) dialog: 
1) 52) dialog: Thanks!
1) 57) dialog: Heads Up!
2) 29) dialog: Please come back tomorrow.
2) 48) dialog: Okay, okay!
2) 54) dialog: 
2) 69) dialog: I was watching. I was fine.
2) 73) dialog: I don't know.
2) 77) dialog: Nothing.
2) 81) dialog: 
2) 86) dialog: 
2) 92) dialog: (a little louder) I mean, why are we here? What are we doing this for?
2) 99) dialog: Nothing is fun.
2) 136) dialog: I haven't played with that thing in years.
6) 14) dialog: Augh!
6) 20) dialog: Shhh!
6) 23) dialog: Ow!
6) 28) dialog: ...You talk.
6) 39) dialog: Augh!
6) 46) dialog: Quiet! I'm not supposed to be out here.
6) 49) dialog: 
8) 6) dialog: No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it! 19.
8) 16) dialog: It does what you tell it?
8) 20) dialog: The sun?
8) 24) dialog: (to the flame) Hi, fire.
8) 28) dialog: But you said it was dying.
8) 32) dialog: It comes from where you come from?
8) 37) dialog: Make some for me. 20.
8) 42) dialog: Make. MAKE! MAKE IT!
8) 48) dialog: Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead?
8) 60) dialog: I don't even know you.
8) 64) dialog: Guy?
8) 71) dialog: What are "pants up?"
8) 75) dialog: Eep.
8) 79) dialog: What?
8) 86) dialog: How do you know?
8) 99) dialog: I can't.
8) 105) dialog: Thank you. Hello? Hey!
8) 108) dialog: Dad!
8) 112) dialog: Nothing. I left on my own.
8) 115) dialog: Dad, let me explain...
8) 120) dialog: 
9) 8) dialog: Mom!
9) 16) dialog: You'll never believe it. I found something new.
9) 23) dialog: Wait. Wait!
9) 27) dialog: It wasn't bad. 24.
9) 32) dialog: No. He was nice.
9) 36) dialog: Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
9) 44) dialog: There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him.
9) 48) dialog: What is wrong with you?
9) 52) dialog: 
9) 61) dialog: What!? You can't keep me inside forever!
9) 65) dialog: He said this would happen.
9) 92) dialog: You really need to see this...
9) 96) dialog: We should go there!
9) 255) dialog: (Sigh.)
9) 272) dialog: Cavies?
9) 276) dialog: Oh... yeah!
9) 280) dialog: Er... yeah...
9) 284) dialog: Uhhh... yeah...
9) 288) dialog: (slapping the knife away) No. It won't help.
9) 298) dialog: No. No. It's "fire."
9) 302) dialog: 
9) 308) dialog: It doesn't come out of him.
9) 316) dialog: Great, now he's broken.
9) 367) dialog: Hi.
9) 370) dialog: Yeah. But I won't let him.
9) 406) dialog: They're not so scary once you get to know them.
9) 446) dialog: Hey, where's Guy?
9) 451) dialog: Going somewhere?
9) 455) dialog: That already happened. It destroyed our cave.
9) 463) dialog: We can't let him go! What if we don't find a cave before sunset? What if it takes a few days? What if the birds come back?
9) 477) dialog: 
9) 487) dialog: Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
9) 491) dialog: Have you been there?
9) 507) dialog: No no, it's okay Sandy. That's just a belt.
10) 14) dialog: Isn't this fun? We're taking our first trip together.
10) 17) dialog: Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!
10) 50) dialog: Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
10) 54) dialog: How about now?
10) 58) dialog: Now?
10) 61) dialog: 
10) 67) dialog: (even louder) NOW?!?!
10) 129) dialog: I'm not tense.
10) 194) dialog: Why are you rolling away?
10) 198) dialog: You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
10) 202) dialog: Really?
11) 6) dialog: What do you call this?
11) 10) dialog: What does it do?
11) 16) dialog: How long have you been alone?
11) 19) dialog: ... So what do we do?
11) 31) dialog: Just move your arm... no, your other arm. Oh, that one's mine.
11) 35) dialog: Uh... It didn't step in your trap-y, thing. 50.
11) 50) dialog: Dad, no!
12) 11) dialog: What are "left-overs?"
12) 16) dialog: We never have that much food.
12) 63) dialog: Tomorrow?
12) 78) dialog: Tomorrow?!
13) 13) dialog: Hey, do you have a minute? How did the tiger fly?
13) 17) dialog: 
13) 22) dialog: Hey Thunk, you have a spider on your face.
13) 25) dialog: 
14) 11) dialog: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love them! Where are my feet!?
14) 14) dialog: Oh, okay.
14) 20) dialog: Really? Thank you!
14) 44) dialog: Oh wow. I love those!
14) 66) dialog: So... How'd the tiger fly?
14) 93) dialog: We don't get out much.
14) 107) dialog: Oh dad, you say that about everything.
14) 112) dialog: Oh really? Okay.
15) 24) dialog: We can do it, dad.
15) 79) dialog: You dropped these.
15) 97) dialog: Mom?
15) 173) dialog: Tomorrow.
15) 180) dialog: I'm going with Guy. 69.
15) 187) dialog: Come with us.
16) 10) dialog: Dad?
16) 90) dialog: Mom?
16) 130) dialog: No.
16) 147) dialog: You have to stop worrying for all of us.
16) 150) dialog: The rules don't work out here.
16) 154) dialog: That wasn't living, that was just, not dying. There's a difference.
16) 160) dialog: We would be dead if we listened you.
16) 163) dialog: We have to follow Guy now.
17) 8) dialog: You were right.
17) 95) dialog: No. I have too much to say to you. I need to fix everything and I don't have time.
17) 100) dialog: This works good. What do you call it?
17) 107) dialog: No. I like a "Hug."
17) 114) dialog: 
17) 118) dialog: Dad, I'm scared.
22) 2) dialog: 
22) 14) dialog: I never got to tell him.
22) 30) dialog: He did it!
22) 44) dialog: I love you too.
22) 72) dialog: You really need to see this.
22) 89) dialog: Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile. But now we know the Croods will make it.
22) 93) dialog: Because we changed the rules. The ones that kept us in the dark.
22) 96) dialog: And because of my dad, who taught us that anyone can change...
22) 101) dialog: Well, sort of.
22) 104) dialog: So from now on we'll stay out here.
22) 107) dialog: Where we can follow the light.
