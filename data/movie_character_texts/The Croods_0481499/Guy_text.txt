6) 17) dialog: 
6) 25) dialog: 
6) 30) dialog: I'm a person, like you.
6) 33) dialog: Sort of... like you.
6) 36) dialog: Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that tickles. Hey!
6) 42) dialog: OW! Wow. --
8) 3) dialog: (in pain, defeated) Wow. You're really strong.
8) 10) dialog: It's dying. I can fix it!
8) 13) dialog: Please. I hate the dark.
8) 18) dialog: Well, yeah, sort of.
8) 22) dialog: No, no. Fire.
8) 26) dialog: 
8) 30) dialog: Uh sorry,--
8) 34) dialog: No. I make it.
8) 40) dialog: Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me.
8) 45) dialog: You do this a lot.
8) 51) dialog: Hey, those are cold!
8) 55) dialog: You think? Listening shells, activate.
8) 58) dialog: I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately. He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an anchor.
8) 62) dialog: (pained, rushed) Ow. I'm Guy.
8) 66) dialog: And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up. 21.
8) 73) dialog: Who are you?
8) 77) dialog: (cutting her off) Let me clarify, Eep. The world is ending.
8) 81) dialog: I'm calling it...
8) 89) dialog: I've seen it. It's coming this way. First, the Earth is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in. Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone.
8) 92) dialog: We've got to get to high ground. I know a mountain, that way--
8) 96) dialog: It's our only chance. (extending his hand) Come with me.
8) 102) dialog: Okay. Here. If you survive, call me.
9) 254) dialog: Ta-da.
9) 270) dialog: Cavies!
9) 274) dialog: Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads?
9) 278) dialog: The huge primitive teeth?
9) 282) dialog: The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's got a tail...
9) 286) dialog: Close your eyes. I'm going to have to take their lives.
9) 291) dialog: What?
9) 313) dialog: You know, you're a lot like your daughter.
9) 369) dialog: So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me.
9) 410) dialog: Who are you people?
9) 414) dialog: Uh, Guy.
9) 441) dialog: gasping for air  (checks to see if he's been
9) 449) dialog: No!
9) 453) dialog: The mountain? High ground? End of the world, remember?
9) 457) dialog: 
9) 475) dialog: What? No I'm not. Don't make me part of this. Stay here if you want, but let me go. I've got a dream, a mission, a reason to live.
9) 480) dialog: 
9) 489) dialog: Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain.
9) 493) dialog: It's a mountain. Mountains are safe. Mountains have caves. And water. And sticks.
9) 497) dialog: Yes. Sticks. Caves and sticks. Crazy sticks. Let's go.
10) 90) dialog: No. No. No. Don't do that. He will cut you. That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.
10) 93) dialog: An animal that you don't eat.
10) 99) dialog: No, no please! 45.
10) 124) dialog: 
10) 127) dialog: You look tense.
10) 142) dialog: What are they doing?
10) 148) dialog: No seriously, what are they doing?
10) 162) dialog: What happened to the egg and the bird? 47.
10) 172) dialog: 
10) 196) dialog: Owww! I just want something to eat.
10) 200) dialog: Please... I'll let you help me hunt.
11) 4) dialog: Okay. Guy carefully SETS the trigger.
11) 8) dialog: A trap.
11) 14) dialog: (explains with sounds) soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom! Tadaaaaaa!
11) 22) dialog: How's your acting?
11) 26) dialog: Oh, you're good at this.
11) 29) dialog: Oh, sorry, I...
11) 38) dialog: Yeah, I noticed.
11) 45) dialog: She's awesome.
12) 8) dialog: 
12) 13) dialog: 
12) 37) dialog: Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist ending. My stories never end like that.
12) 44) dialog: Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's. Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave with the rest of her family. Her father and mother told her, "You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
12) 49) dialog: But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. She leaned out to touch it, and slipped.
12) 53) dialog: And she flew.
12) 61) dialog: Tomorrow.
12) 65) dialog: A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
12) 69) dialog: A place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better.
12) 73) dialog: Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's where I'm going.
12) 91) dialog: 
13) 7) dialog: That was too close. It almost caught us.
13) 11) dialog: We've got to move faster. Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander?" I'll take a shamble at this point.
13) 15) dialog: I only share when I'm outside the log. I'm funny that way.
13) 53) dialog: Ow, ow, ow.
13) 69) dialog: I can help you, but we're going to have to make a few changes around here. The log ride is over. Drop the log.
13) 72) dialog: Now, kick it away.
13) 75) dialog: Farther.
13) 79) dialog: Really?!
14) 8) dialog: Okay. Now you can look.
14) 12) dialog: They're still there!
14) 17) dialog: Whoa. You're really
14) 26) dialog: 
14) 31) dialog: Ah ha.
14) 35) dialog: I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.
14) 68) dialog: He jumped on the sun and rode it to tomorrow.
14) 91) dialog: You've seen rain before... right?
14) 110) dialog: Careful.
14) 135) dialog: So the bear says, "Your cave?" I've been dumping my bones here since last week.
14) 139) dialog: It's not a story! It's a joke.
14) 143) dialog: You know, just making something up... to make you laugh.
15) 4) dialog: Here you go, one for you, and this ones for you.
15) 11) dialog: So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.
15) 15) dialog: We can try more paths at once. It's the fastest way through. 63.
15) 22) dialog: They can handle it.
15) 32) dialog: Oh, hello.
15) 48) dialog: No. Too slow. Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.
15) 87) dialog: Come with me.
15) 164) dialog: I want to show you something.
15) 171) dialog: Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to rest up there.
15) 175) dialog: That's where we'll be safe.
16) 12) dialog: He's a big guy. How can he just disappear like that?
16) 30) dialog: Is that a snake?
16) 44) dialog: That, doesn't--
16) 75) dialog: Grug. We have to keep moving.
16) 119) dialog: We're here.
16) 181) dialog: This is pointless. We're running out of time. Everything is collapsing. You're being irrational and counterproductive.
16) 185) dialog: Countermeasures.
16) 188) dialog: Remember how you were this morning? You changed, remember? Idea man? Modern man?
16) 195) dialog: No, no, no wait.
16) 200) dialog: 
16) 204) dialog: Please Grug. You have to stop struggling.
16) 208) dialog: Grug! Stop!
16) 211) dialog: No one gets out of this. Believe me. I know.
16) 216) dialog: Family. Yeah.
16) 222) dialog: I was little when it happened. The last thing my parents told me was, "Don't hide. Live. Follow the Sun. You'll make it to Tomorrow."
16) 228) dialog: No. She's like you. She loves you but always forgets to say it. Just like you forget to tell her.
16) 235) dialog: It's okay. That's what Dads do.
16) 243) dialog: Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!
16) 247) dialog: Ow!
16) 260) dialog: Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go.
16) 263) dialog: There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity. Move me.
16) 266) dialog: Okay he sees us! Belt plays a little melodramatic tune.
16) 269) dialog: That's our cue. Now work it!
16) 272) dialog: He's not coming over. I don't think our puppet looks scared enough.
16) 281) dialog: Hold on!
16) 296) dialog: Hey, we're okay!
16) 299) dialog: Yeah, we're okay. 80.
16) 303) dialog: Grug. Your call.
17) 5) dialog: Hurry! Come on. We're gonna make it!
17) 10) dialog: There it is. The sun. We can do it! We can ride it to Tomorrow.
17) 14) dialog: Run!
17) 20) dialog: I don't understand. The sun was right here. It was right here.
17) 52) dialog: I'll take that chance.
17) 57) dialog: Heh. That's a joke, right?
17) 124) dialog: There. I see him!
22) 6) dialog: It's not safe here. 88.
22) 32) dialog: He's riding the Sun... but not very well. Everybody out of the way!
