0) 48) dialog: Three days is not forever.
0) 52) dialog: Eep would you come down here? You're being so dramatic.
0) 55) dialog: No, no, no Sandy, come back here. Remember the signal. Good girls wait for the signal.
0) 58) dialog: Ugga.
0) 61) dialog: No, I mean, you're already out now.
0) 66) dialog: Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out. 4.
0) 71) dialog: The signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.
0) 79) dialog: Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
0) 88) dialog: It's still early.
0) 92) dialog: Breakfast formation!
0) 96) dialog: I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast. We do this loud, we do this as a family and never not be afraid. Go!
1) 7) dialog: Who's up?
1) 10) dialog: We'll flip for it.
1) 13) dialog: Call her in the air.
1) 18) dialog: Tails. Thunk's in.
1) 20) dialog: Positions. 6.
1) 24) dialog: Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
1) 27) dialog: Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
1) 31) dialog: Oooh!
1) 33) dialog: Release the baby.
1) 55) dialog: Eep!
1) 68) dialog: Just wait till we get home. Eep put on the brakes.
1) 74) dialog: Eep!
1) 77) dialog: Who's hungry?
1) 81) dialog: Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
1) 89) dialog: That's alright. I ate last week.
2) 2) dialog: Come on, come on. Darkness brings death! We know this.
2) 23) dialog: Is she still out there?
2) 32) dialog: How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy.
2) 36) dialog: It's not that dark.
2) 39) dialog: 
2) 43) dialog: Come on, I gotta close the cave...
2) 46) dialog: Eep!
2) 50) dialog: Come on.
2) 53) dialog: 
2) 58) dialog: 
2) 67) dialog: That was too close!
2) 71) dialog: What were you doing up there, Eep?
2) 75) dialog: What were you looking for?
2) 79) dialog: Well then why did you go up there?
2) 83) dialog: Why don't you know? Stop looking for things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never not be afraid.
2) 89) dialog: Hmmm? What was that? 12.
2) 97) dialog: No one said survival was fun.
2) 101) dialog: Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?
2) 106) dialog: Yes.
2) 111) dialog: I just don't see why she needs her own ledge. That's all. That's what this is about.
2) 115) dialog: What things? How long is this going to take? Really? I mean she already doesn't listen to me.
2) 118) dialog: Hey!
2) 123) dialog: If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
2) 128) dialog: 
2) 134) dialog: Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep! Your old favorite?
2) 138) dialog: Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
2) 141) dialog: A long time ago, this little bear was alive. She was alive because she listened to her father and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror. So she was happy. But Krispy had one, terrible problem. She was filled with... curiosity.
2) 147) dialog: Yes. And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
2) 151) dialog: And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died.
2) 156) dialog: Yes! Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
2) 164) dialog: Good man, Thunk.
7) 3) dialog: 
7) 8) dialog: Stay in the cave!
8) 110) dialog: Are you hurt? What took you?
8) 114) dialog: You... youuuuuuu... ww-what!?
8) 123) dialog: You're grounded.
9) 3) dialog: Hey!
9) 12) dialog: You know what, I am so mad right now, that I can't talk to her.
9) 20) dialog: New's a big problem!
9) 30) dialog: New is always bad.
9) 34) dialog: What!? Excuse me? He?
9) 50) dialog: It was dangerous.
9) 59) dialog: Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!
9) 68) dialog: Get to the cave! GO!
9) 72) dialog: Look out! Stop!
9) 80) dialog: Is everyone okay?
9) 86) dialog: No.
9) 98) dialog: No. No one is going anywhere.
9) 101) dialog: What else did that boy say?
9) 113) dialog: Just go! Go! Go!
9) 129) dialog: One, two, three, four, five -- BEAT. Grug smiles.
9) 132) dialog: 
9) 137) dialog: I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a lower place. One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came. 28.
9) 149) dialog: No, no! Come back, Sandy!
9) 152) dialog: 
9) 156) dialog: 
9) 160) dialog: Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay.
9) 172) dialog: Wait.
9) 180) dialog: I'll take care of this.
9) 183) dialog: WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!
9) 196) dialog: That's right! You can't get past this!
9) 207) dialog: Climb! Climb! Climb!
9) 210) dialog: 
9) 214) dialog: Come on! Hurry up, let's go! Come on!
9) 226) dialog: Okay, that's one, two, three, four, five... six...
9) 239) dialog: Kill circle!
9) 244) dialog: Eep! Eeeep!
9) 258) dialog: Auughhauhhhgggh!
9) 306) dialog: Make some for me!
9) 310) dialog: Make. Make it.
9) 320) dialog: Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it wants.
9) 323) dialog: Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll find a new cave, and pretend today never happened.
9) 326) dialog: (looks at the fire) Isn't this fun, Eep?
9) 329) dialog: Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows where he's been.
9) 335) dialog: Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!
9) 339) dialog: Hey, stay back.
9) 342) dialog: No, no, no, wait!
9) 352) dialog: Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass!
9) 423) dialog: Don't eat it, it's new.
9) 460) dialog: (as if to a dog) Eep. Drop it.
9) 470) dialog: Fine. You're staying with us till we find a cave.
9) 484) dialog: 
9) 510) dialog: I've made a decision. We're going to, that mountain! Don't ask me why. It's just a hunch. It just feels right.
9) 518) dialog: 
10) 19) dialog: Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?! Because I will turn this family around so fast!
10) 26) dialog: Come on, you can hold it.
10) 37) dialog: 
10) 52) dialog: No.
10) 56) dialog: No.
10) 59) dialog: No.
10) 64) dialog: 
10) 69) dialog: I can do this all day long. No, no, no, and still no.
10) 85) dialog: We'll eat when we get there.
10) 97) dialog: No man should have a pet. It's weird, and wrong. It's-- (spies giant bird) ...It's food!
10) 102) dialog: Not that. That.
10) 110) dialog: Food fixes everything.
10) 113) dialog: Alright, show me your hunting face.
10) 118) dialog: Not you! You're still grounded!
10) 120) dialog: Come on, Thunk.
10) 138) dialog: Hang on Thunk, I'm coming!
10) 159) dialog: There! Who's hungry for scorpion?
10) 190) dialog: Hold her still. Use a rock. Ugga would you just hit her legs.
11) 42) dialog: Where's Eep?
11) 48) dialog: Eep!
12) 21) dialog: That's a good idea. How about a story huh?
12) 26) dialog: Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
12) 30) dialog: I know! But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway.
12) 35) dialog: Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end.
12) 46) dialog: And die. Good story.
12) 51) dialog: And she fell.
12) 71) dialog: Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!
12) 76) dialog: Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep. And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want.
12) 79) dialog: A cave.
12) 87) dialog: snoring, tossing and turning  54.
13) 9) dialog: I was watching. We were fine.
13) 29) dialog: He's loose!
13) 32) dialog: Aaaaahhhhhh! Do not step on those weird, pointy rocks!
13) 39) dialog: Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is listening. You cannot walk on those!
13) 42) dialog: Arraughrragh come back here now.
13) 50) dialog: Okay. Arraugh!
13) 81) dialog: Okay, smart, Guy... now what?
14) 24) dialog: Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!!
14) 39) dialog: We've gotten along just fine without brains till now. Cavemen don't need brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha! (balls his mighty fists) That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings. Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.
14) 41) dialog: Now, let's get to that mountain.
14) 71) dialog: No, no, no! The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow.
14) 75) dialog: Ooowwwww!
14) 103) dialog: 
14) 120) dialog: Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool. Not cool.
15) 9) dialog: Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
15) 13) dialog: Wait-- you're saying we should split up?
15) 18) dialog: Croods stick together.
15) 20) dialog: Your way isn't safe.
15) 26) dialog: No no no no no. It's my job to keep you safe. I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up. (seeing Eep and Guy together) Except for you two. And that's final.
15) 38) dialog: 
15) 46) dialog: Stay where you are. I'll find you.
15) 52) dialog: 
15) 135) dialog: 
15) 140) dialog: Oh, oh, `Guy'. `Guy' is with them. Well thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update!
15) 146) dialog: Sleep pile? How about a story, huh? Anyone?
15) 184) dialog: 
15) 202) dialog: Grug smiles to himself.
16) 19) dialog: Haven't seen him.
16) 27) dialog: (Playing to Eep) Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz like all these, ideas just kept coming to me.
16) 32) dialog: Belt! New and improved! It's even self- tightening. Ow!
16) 41) dialog: (swings his long hair around) I call it a "rug." Rhymes with Grug. And this one. I call it a "ride." Rhymes with Grug.
16) 46) dialog: It's gonna get us places faster than shoes.
16) 49) dialog: Yeah. Try to keep up.
16) 57) dialog: Painting is a thing of the past. I call this, a "snap-shot."
16) 68) dialog: I call them "shades."
16) 72) dialog: Since I don't have a brain, they're coming from my stomach. Down deep below, and then up again into my mind.
16) 78) dialog: 
16) 80) dialog: See, I got ideas, I got thoughts.
16) 83) dialog: Like this. I call it a "mobile home." Isn't that something?
16) 86) dialog: 
16) 88) dialog: And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."
16) 108) dialog: 
16) 112) dialog: I thought if I could have ideas like Guy, maybe Eep would listen to me. Maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.
16) 117) dialog: And I also thought it would kill your mother. So you know? Win win.
16) 127) dialog: Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry up, let's go. Go, go.
16) 135) dialog: What?
16) 139) dialog: Wait, so you're all going to do this?
16) 142) dialog: Thunk?
16) 148) dialog: It's my job to worry. It's my job to follow the rules.
16) 152) dialog: They kept us alive.
16) 156) dialog: Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.
16) 166) dialog: Guy?
16) 171) dialog: 
16) 183) dialog: Big words anger me. Keep talking.
16) 193) dialog: I... am... a... CAVEMAN.
16) 198) dialog: Hnnnnnngh! No. What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
16) 206) dialog: No. I have to get back to them.
16) 214) dialog: Your...?
16) 218) dialog: Sorry.
16) 226) dialog: You followed the light. My daughter is a lot like you.
16) 231) dialog: 
16) 237) dialog: That's right... but we can't do that from here. We need one of your ideas.
16) 240) dialog: Come on. You can do it.
16) 258) dialog: Wow.
16) 274) dialog: Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me those acting sticks! 79.
16) 288) dialog: Yes. You did it!
16) 306) dialog: Take us to Tomorrow.
17) 33) dialog: No more dark. No more hiding. No more caves.
17) 37) dialog: What's the point of all this?
17) 41) dialog: To follow the light. 82.
17) 45) dialog: I can't change. I don't have ideas. But I have my strength. And right now that's all you need.
17) 49) dialog: It's a chance.
17) 55) dialog: You know, I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.
17) 59) dialog: What's a joke?
17) 66) dialog: Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
17) 70) dialog: When you make it, so will I.
17) 80) dialog: Gran.
17) 93) dialog: Time to go.
17) 97) dialog: I can fix it.
17) 102) dialog: I was thinking of calling it a Hug. (clears his throat)
17) 105) dialog: Because it rhymes with Grug. But you can change it if you want.
17) 111) dialog: I love you.
17) 120) dialog: Never be afraid.
19) 3) dialog: 
19) 8) dialog: Ahhhh! Back! Stay back! Stay back!
20) 4) dialog: They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm coming.
20) 7) dialog: How do I get across? Gotta think. What would Guy do? What would Guy do?
20) 11) dialog: What would I do?
20) 14) dialog: Hold this.
20) 18) dialog: I... have... an... IDEA!
21) 4) dialog: Run! Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.
21) 7) dialog: Yes!
21) 11) dialog: Douglas?
21) 14) dialog: Hey, I know that guy.
21) 17) dialog: Get up!
21) 21) dialog: Hold on.
22) 40) dialog: Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their shell?
22) 47) dialog: One, two, three, four, five, six...
22) 50) dialog: ... and seven.
22) 55) dialog: And a half.
22) 58) dialog: And eight, and nine. Douglas runs up and licks Thunk.
22) 62) dialog: Well, a boys gotta have a pet.
22) 65) dialog: Turns out, I'm a cat person.
22) 69) dialog: Uh! No.
22) 75) dialog: We should go there.
22) 99) dialog: Release the baby!
