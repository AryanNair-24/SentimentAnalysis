As he hits t bottom, he hits the brakes hard. Stops abruptly. The SUV so close, does not anticipate. Smashes right into the rea of Bryan's car. The driver flies right through his windshield, shattering both the window and his face. Bryan guns the SUV, takes off again because the other two SUV's have come around the side of the grade and are clos fast. Bryan looks ahead, sees up above on a plateau, four Massive earth movers pushing tons of dirt and rock down i a depression. Bryan races right towards the landslide about to happen. The SUV's race to catch him. Bryan keeps watching the movement up above. Slows down ju enough for the SUV's to come closer, maneuvers right unde the landslide of earth coming down. The dirt starts to hit his windshield, making visibility precarious. He slows even more. Checks the SUV's in the mirror, sees the men on them pulling their guns, not look up, just intent on their prey. And then, just as the SUV's have Bryan in range, a rumbli distracts them and they see a landslide of earth coming d Bryan guns his SUV, rockets just ahead of the massive sli driving blind in the cascading debris and dirt.

Bryan sees a load of steel beams being lifted off the gro swinging left to right. He cuts hard around them. Tips them with his front fender. The beams spin around fast. Anton, barely able to see through the debris and mud splattering on his windshield, does not see the beam end that crashes through his windshield, until it is too late It crushes his chest. Bryan looks back, sees the beam jammed through Anton's windshield, looks over at the back seat at the unconsciou girl. Sirens are sounding in the distance. Bryan looks up and sees the flashing lights of police cars approaching. He drives off in the opposite direction.
