80) 6) dialog: (on monitor) Two men are dead, and another critically wounded after a shoot-out near the Superior Court Building today.  A police air-remote unit captured this dramatic footage at 9:47 this morning, after automatically homing on the sound of gunfire. A monochromatic AERIAL SHOT of the downtown area.  It is feed from the police hoverdrone, and the image is overlai with some alphanumeric data like the targeting video from jet fighter weapons system.  The image slews suddenly in WHIP PAN as the robot reacts to the first shots fired.  I stabilizes and zooms in on a dark Suburban which is rammi car and trying to force it to the curb.  A second Suburba pulls out of an alley and blocks the car's path.  The car skids to a stop.  It is all seen from almost directly overhead, like a football play. The doors of the Suburbans fly open and four gunmen pile wearing ski-masks and carrying machine pistols.  They converge on the car, firing.  The car's windows erupt wit white starbursts, the weapons smoke and flash, but no sou accompanies the image. Two bodyguards leap from the car, firing at the gunmen. are wearing heavy kevlar vests, as are the attackers.  A door of the car opens and a man emerges, yanking a child onto the street.  He shields her with his body as he star to run.  The image jerks and slews as the aerial robot circles the scene. TIGHT ON MAX...as it dawns on her what she is seeing. A woman has emerged from the back of the car, obviously screaming and trying to reach the child.  One of the body guards shoves her and appears to be yelling at her to run He is shot by one of the attackers and drops like a puppe with the strings cut.  The woman turns and sprints for he life. The man trying to shield the little girl doesn't get far before one of the gunmen runs up behind him and hoses him with a machine pistol.  The man drops, covering the girl.
