The guard flings open the door, sweeping his gun toward Max, all in SLOW MOTION...except Max, who is moving much faster, thou normal to our eye, whereas everyone and everything else appears as if underwater. Max easily ducks the lamp, which is just shattering again the wall as the guard takes aim with a two-handed grip. room goes dark as the lightbulb explodes. Max moves sideways before the guard can pull the trigger. BLAM!  The room strobes with the shot but the bullet goes where Max was, not where she is now...halfway to the guar moving like a freight train. BLAM!  A second shot...but Max has seen the intention and jinked again.  The bullet carves the air next to her.  Sh reaches the guy and gets a hand on the gun, yanking it do and around in a sweeping roundhouse which twists it out o his hand. This guy is big, 6'3" and 250 lbs., mostly muscle, except that paunch.  Max follows through with a footsweep takedo and drops onto the guy hard with his arm twisted behind h back. Max unloads the pistol, sliding out the magazine and jack out the chambered round.  She throws the gun one way and mag the other. BACK TO NORMAL SPEED, the guard struggles to move but Max drops onto him knee first again, knocking the wind out of for awhile.  Max looks up at the terrified mother and the crying little girl.
