108) 36) dialog: Aaach...Jane... (glancing at note)
108) 40) dialog: You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
108) 42) dialog: I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
108) 45) dialog: What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen. (seeing he's not reaching her)
108) 48) dialog: No.  You know that I'm not.
108) 50) dialog: Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told. She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.
108) 52) dialog: Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you. (realizing)

109) 13) text: He says you could hardly notice it. Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as sh so:
109) 15) dialog: Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
109) 17) dialog: Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.

109) 38) text: But I can't -- I can't breathe. Damn it! She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

119) 20) dialog: It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
119) 22) dialog: Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right? He extends his hand.
119) 24) dialog: No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard. Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes - few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.
119) 25) dialog: This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
119) 27) text: I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way... Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

125) 12) dialog: Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
125) 15) dialog: I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him... (deliberately)
125) 18) dialog: I hope so... (on her look he relents)
125) 20) text: I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay? Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises, walks away, then turns.
125) 21) dialog: Jane, you know how Tom had tears in the piece the other night?  Ask yourself how we were able to see them when he only had one camera and that was pointing at the girl during the interview. (on her reaction)
