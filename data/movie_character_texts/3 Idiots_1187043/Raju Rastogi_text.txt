He is an uninhibited free spirit wi genuine queries. He does not operate with arrogance or co also played him with that inherent earnestness.

The film starts with Farhan abandoning a flight that has was a long process before you arrived at this opening for drafts I read, several approaches were tried including th contemplating bringing in Amitabh Bachchan as the narrato opening scene and why was this scene the most appropriate RH: The starting point is always tough.

But these things are a matter of explorati possibilities and then chooses the one that best works fo Joy’s suicide was a critical point of debate. There are d several that did not. Its inclusion was probably most fie entire screenplay. It was felt that this was too dark an that it might dilute the revelation of Virus’s son’s deat was the thought behind the suicide scene and the reason f 20 minutes of getting into the film? VC: There was a lot of back and forth that happened over doubts about whether we should include this or not. But w that this gave motivation to Rancho’s character. Raju too adding a montage and a voice-over at the editing stage. T with Farhan’s voice-over talking about Rancho and his qui there the voice-over says, “Ek aur tha bilkul Rancho jais voice-over that Raju introduced at the editing table, int the script. Otherwise, it would have been too much of a j that a brilliant guy like Rancho can go one way or the ot Phunsukh Wangdu or become so dejected by seeing mediocrit that he gives up on life. RH: Joy’s suicide was thrown out and brought back innumer and I were very keen to keep it as we felt that the confl from there, otherwise it would just be a fun film without it. Vinod and Aamir felt that it should not be there. The too dark and grim. It was a jarring inclusion in the film convinced that this had to be there. This went on for a l got it back into the script a month before the shoot star But the debate over it continued and then finally the mon during the edit, settled the matter. Earlier, the Rancho the film. We had not even planned to keep it. Nevertheles that if I ever felt like reviving it, then it could be do first screening of the film we organised for a sample aud being a mad genius was not coming across. I added the mon 332 it with Joy’s introduction by that voice-over, made Joy and also lent him credibility. AJ: Joy’s suicide is the spine of the film. The second-ha devices. But Joy’s suicide is what makes Rancho realise t is the killer and it has to be fought. It is this belief and the story forward. Otherwise, why is he doing the thi first half of the film would become insubstantial if we t The challenge was to put this thing that worries us about so that we know what Rancho is fighting, and the film is the weight of this intense scene. The interval point is a bit of a shock. The tone of the s are unlike the rest of the film. There were other interva well before arriving at this one. How did this come about RH: I wanted the fact that Rancho is an imposter to be re I felt if we stretched revealing this till the interval, very rich kid had come into a college and was having fun. needed to be told as quickly in the film as possible that it would get the audience to feel for him. So in the earl the flashback one more time in the first half to reveal t Rancho but an imposter. Then we went back into the flashb different interval point (Farhan and Raju discovering tha being one of the options considered). But after a lot of script, I felt that the interval would be a great point t Rancho but an imposter. Sometimes, I still feel that it m reveal this earlier even though what we eventually put in point. In the end, these are choices that one makes. So o was going to be the interval point, we narrated it to Vin add the element of the college photograph having a differ appealed to me as it enhanced the scene. VC: Unlike the West, Indian cinema does not follow the th a two-act deal. It is a very unusual way of watching movi world watches films like this — you see one part of the f chai, then you watch the rest of the film. This makes the critical. Therefore, one must invest a lot of thought in happen. In this film, my thought process was focussed on 333 the audience when they would go and buy their popcorn. B to come back to find out what happens next in the film is the suggestion, I did not think that Raju would retain it quality to the twist. I felt that the audience would enjo time I told Raju, he said he liked it but I do not believ evening. It is an age-old joke between us that I am the ‘ he is the ‘next morning guy’. He likes to mull over and t He makes up his mind only after that. So I always go with things the next morning and not on the evening that they happy that he retained it. The film initially ended with these people finding Rancho in a school, leading a simple happy life doing what he lo ‘Wangdu was not in the film at all. How did the idea of P fall into place? RH: Yes, that is true. Phunsukh Wangdu was not in the fil ended with Farhan, Raju, and Pia reaching Ladakh and disc teaches in this fascinating little school and that is his to do, he did it. But we felt that maybe the audience wou They would probably say that ‘yaar khush to hain, lekin p na” (He might be happy but he earns very little money). W audience understand, we had to show him to be successful way. This is the reason we added the Phunsukh Wangdu, cov and backtracked to plant him in the film. This is where C He was shown to be looking for someone in the entire film man he is searching for is Rancho. The idea was to show a out of choice. Rancho has the option of signing a deal wi millions but he has chosen to do differently. We felt thi understand things better. Another reason was that we kept feeling that the climax w that our climax was the delivery and then we were just wr Ladakh. It felt weak. We, however, were doing a lot of th were showing an unusual school. As Farhan, Raju, and Pia see (an entire scene was there intially) that a race is g and one kid falls down. Instead of carrying on, all the k him up and then proceed to finish the rest of the race. T 334 other and say that this can only be Rancho’s school. Cha initially had Millimeter in it. So all this material was not coming together to result in a spectacular end to the Phunsukh Wangdu, things started falling into place. But t get it all together at the end took us a lot of time. Fin a big twist at the end. We solved the Phunsukh Wangdu riddle in our heads in Goa. a writing visit to Mumbai. I received a call to attend th (IFFI, end 2007). We decided to travel to Goa for two day reason to get away from Mumbai and write. We stayed at th one where we had shot the Lage Raho song with the old peo excited about it. He has this fascination for revisiting Except for the chief minister’s party the night we had ar the festival at all. We took a long walk on the beach the Phunsukh Wangdu fell into place. It was quite magical and with the climax after that. Phunsukh Wangdu, the real identity of Rancho, is revealed point of revelation that Rancho is actually Phunsukh Wang you battled with for over a year. What made you decide th RH: This was a tough one to decide. We were unsure of thi before we shot the scene. Abhijat and I felt that it shou the friends reunite, before Chatur’s arrival. By doing th to the audience that Rancho was Phunsukh Wangdu, the man and Chatur’s dialogues and demeanour with Rancho after th become even more hilarious to the audience as they would in for a real shock when he found out that Rancho is Phun and Madhavan were of the view that the revelation should that the film ends on a high note. They felt that reveali this dramatic twist. This is when the tussle started. Abh long time but Aamir and Madhavan were so vehement and ins a question in our minds also. When I was in Ladakh for th feel that maybe their suggestion holds some weight. Maybe would be a great way to end the film. So I changed it and day before the shoot. Frankly, I still don’t know which r it is a matter of interpretation. Both routes are correct 335 Chatur’s speech scene is a complete departure from the R and the overall VCF sensibility. There were also varied o shloka at the end of the speech. Were there any apprehens writing this? RH: I was aware that what we were doing with this film, w There was also complete awareness of the fact that we mig what people might label as toilet humour. There are raggi their underwear. The language is of a certain quality and but while writing, we realised that the campus world we h completely false if we didn’t use the language, the irrev whole college milieu while creating it. This is the way t our job was to stay true to this world. This was the nece scene we cracked when Abhijat and I were in Columbus, Ohi decision that Rancho will change Chatur’s speech was alre not worked out the details of the scene yet. We decided t for ourselves. It would have been easy to change the enti words were to be changed, then it would have been tough. was to write a speech that, if kept in its original forma were to change just a few words in it, then it would beco We struggled for many days to find the right words.

I decided there an in the speech scene and it was incorporated at the end of already had this trait of farting and is called Silencer 336 in perfectly. But Vinod felt we should take it out. Late But I was very keen to retain it. During the edit, Vinod too long and we should take out the shloka but Vir (Vinod saw the scene was in splits and didn’t want me to touch i in the film so I was happy that eventually everyone came VC: (Blushing) I was very shocked by that shloka. But Vir through screenings on other people and they died laughing nothing to do with sensibility because as Raju said, one of the film and not some general sensibility. Therefore, issues here. I just felt that the scene was getting too l stretch. My biggest concern is always that the audience s AJ: The speech scene was hilarious but I must say that it as a set piece for humour. It is the illustration and the of the ideologies which is the key element in the film. R learning that our education system encourages. He is comp ‘definition of a machine’ scene introduces that. The spee of following blindly without understanding the meaning of Chatur is end-oriented whereas Rancho worries about the j the battle of the philosophies becomes an open battle. Ri have the scene where Chatur and Rancho lay a bet to meet who is more successful. The speech scene lent to the prog the film. The shloka at the end is another story. I knew that if I immediately want it in the film and that is what happened was unsure about it like Vinod and like he said, it was n issues. It was because I felt that Rancho probably would speech to this extent. He would change just two words and for him to drive the point home. But I am glad that Raju end because the shloka is the pitce de résistance of the The delivery scene has invited a lot of mixed reactions f audience. I remember you telling me that you began this f on the climax because that was a huge challenge you faced Raho? Frankly, what were you people thinking when you dec the concluding episode in the film? 337 RH: The origin of this scene is from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. scene where Munna gets admission into medical college. He spite Asthana. He has no other motivation to study at a m than his disdain for Asthana. One night, he is roaming th They are drunk. Munna is wearing the doctor's white jacke a doctor.

He spots Munna and drags Munna into the thinks that Munna is a doctor. These guys have no idea wh they get through the delivery. The idea behind the scene realise the value and responsibilities of doctors. The mo this would have hit him. Now, he would really want to stu script underwent many changes and this route was abandone about it. While writing 3 Idiots, like I told you earlier first decide the climax. Abhijat and I talk a lot when we one of the scenes I mentioned again and Abhijat said, “Wh here?” Rancho could apply engineering for the delivery. T with a short story I had read somewhere about a man who u baby while he was still in his mother’s womb, connected w ‘Aal izz well’, our climax, started taking shape. Then, w gynaecologists to make it authentic. It became a big joke Vinod used to come to office and ask for us, he was told the gynaecologist. Everyone teased us endlessly about our One of my friends had introduced us to Dr. Sejal Desai wh while writing this scene. She told us about the various p could be delivered. The only procedure which could be com was the suction method. A lot of people think that this c scene is totally authentic and it is possible to deliver step, we consulted the doctors and, in a way, we wrote th lot of work, a lot of research, and a lot of time were sp the shoot, the doctors were there and constantly monitori and how it was being depicted. This is not one of those u things that we have put in the film for the sake of a gre You have often referred to the three scenes that constitu in the film as the soul of 3 Idiots: Raju’s job interview 338 with his father, and Rancho breaking down when they come about their triumphs. These scenes had several rewrites b final form in which they are in the film. Why do you feel the essence of 3 idiots? RH: These are the moments in the film I am most attached very emotional. Even while narrating these scenes, I woul emotion. In a way, I feel, they are the crux of the film. of an underdog succeeding. I like hope. I see victory in do whatever you want without fear. This is what one wants had to put a lot of work into these scenes. For example, happened in order to elevate the interview scene to the l to. It was written and rewritten several times. Initially things about fear, god, and superstition and he used to g scene was flat. It lacked punch and impact. Then we hit u which transformed the scene completely. How this happened is quiet remarkable as well. I had read about a small boy who is asked by his teacher to write an to become. The boy writes his essay describing his dream, day with thousands of horses. The teacher is not impresse this unrealistic aim to a more practical one. He tells hi more achievable as the boy comes from too poor a backgrou dream. He also threatens to fail him in the assignment if comes the next day and again submits the same assignment. now. He tells him that he will surely get an F on this as “You can keep your F Sir and I will keep my dream.” I was story. I narrated it to Abhijat and was itching to use it subconscious thought was to apply this somewhere in the s find the right moment or place for it. In the end, in a d this scene. I think the thought here is of preserving wha willing to give that up, then that is the first step towa your dreams. Farhan’s confrontation with his father, apar not an easy scene to execute. Even in the writing of it, satisfied with the trigger that makes the father come aro has to say more, do more. Something here was not working very unsure about executing the father’s change of heart. pitch, everything had to be perfect for this scene to wor 339 Abhijat. I was very restless about this. He reassured me something. He wrote this entire scene on his own and mail What clicked was this gesture he suggested for Farhan. Th during their conversation and comes and sits down on a ch his father and kneels down before him and talks to him. I and total submission that elevated the scene. If you noti is not of rebellion but of persuasion. Farhan is asking f informing his parents.

You need to see the aftermath, otherwise it to pacing a film is as much in speeding it up as in slowi breathe when the screenplay demands it. I wrote this scen in the earlier scenes to its rightful conclusion. But when we shot the scene that in its original form had and hug Rancho and he breaks down, I was not satisfied. I him about what he thought of them taking off their pants tussi great ho,” to Rancho. Earlier this was to happen ri reunite in Ladakh. Abhijat liked the idea and we changed removed it from the climax of the film and brought it up these boys, now Chatur takes off his pants at the end and great ho. Tohfa kabool karo.” There seems to be a design to the way 3 Idiots has been w is carefully balanced with laughter. The audience does no weight of any scene. Was this intentional? RH: This is an inherent trait in all my films. If I had m everything with laughter. I believe in the world that I c can choose to be cynical or one can choose to look at thi really analyse the emotional, dramatic scenes, you will n of happiness and hope and not of despair and loss except 340 sadness in films. So more than design, this happens beca the world: our beliefs, experiences, and ideas. AJ: I agree with Raju but it is still gratifying to see t we managed to diffuse the tension by making people laugh of craft, this is a massive challenge. It can ruin a film effortlessly. Our inspiration for this was The Lion King. hard-hitting, unforgettable, and memorable moment but exa you are transported to the world of ‘Hakuna Matata’. We s we are moved and stirred but two minutes later we are sin with joy and hope. Most screenplays would dwell on an eve for at least ten minutes. Your (Raju and Abhijat) collaboration began during Lage R It continued through 3 Idiots and now you are writing ano It is a delicate relationship where many things have to c become productive. How does it work for both of you? AJ: Raju and I share the same sensibility. Our approaches that we want to take, are all the same. When Raju and I w follow is completely non-linear. We start with writing th is a nightmare later to string them together and beat the the magic of this method is that once you do this, you ha such an unknown path that the audience has no chance of s trajectory of the film. So we first follow the magic and most and then apply reason and bind it together. It is a of minds. RH: I spend more time with him than I do with my wife. I (laughs). Apart from him being a good writer and our sens (we are both from small towns and we have shared similar points are the same), the quality I most enjoy and admire not defend his scenes.

We s from the perspective of craft. The ability to think from film honestly vanishes. For me, to keep this faculty to t is the biggest battle. This is what leads to honest work. to bring in fresh ideas. It is very tough to do that thes be there to achieve this. AJ: I feel that novelty of idea is paramount. Anything yo to write should not have the sound of something that has times before. The approach that though it has been done b so well that it will work, according to me, does not work about the idea that you choose and you need to believe in to you to begin with. Once you have settled on the idea, in. A screenplay demands a lot of time and patience. The 342 quality is the goal, cannot be rushed. Therefore, you mu that time. At least two to three years.

Unaware that Raju had a ready script or was even working stunned by the turn of events. Vinod had managed to stump But this time things did work out. You had expressed a desire to work with Raju. Both of you discussed a project. Why did things not work out earlier? I have very high regard for Raju’s work and for Raju as a we met was at the premiere of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. | loved it was wonderful. A little over six months after that, Ra idea he had for a film. This was before Lage Raho. 1 was decided to meet the moment I was back in town. After I re meet me and told me that things had changed.

A l and he had agreed with, had been addressed. ‘What were the problems that you had with the first versi was narrated to you? My basic problem was that Rancho was too heroic in the fi and belting out one smart line after another. I felt he s guy. For example, in the introduction scene, initially, h faced the guys who were ragging him. It was Rancho’s atti that was a problem for me. The scene has stayed pretty mu been earlier. Rancho’s attitude did not make sense to me. into the first year should be scared when he faces his se guy who comes in and churns out smart lines. He came acro and too sure of himself. But as I understood him, he seem normal. He does not really know how to face guys who are are bullying him. That is the reason he runs away and hid The tone initially was of one-upmanship and I felt that R care about that. I wanted him to be scared in the ragging of fear and not out of knowing how to handle these tough in the scene where the Director addresses the first year about the astronaut’s pen, had I said my lines in a cocky would have comes across differently but when the lines ar excitement as though the idea has just occurred to the ch is a damn good one, so he just says it out loud because h takes on a different colour altogether. Rancho is enthusi and shares them spontaneously but he does not know why th because he has not said anything meaning to be funny. Yet joke. Other people find it funny. This is broadly what I was the crystallisation of the core thought that I was ex is trying to say — chase excellence and not success — and coming through in Rancho. 362 You were not convinced about playing a 20-year-old stude made you change your mind? When I read the script, I did not feel that Rancho is me naturally brilliant guy and I don’t see myself as that. R all along I have been following but as a personality he i myself as that. But broadly speaking, how he lives his li mine but when I was reading the script, I didn’t see it t myself that way, so I couldn’t relate myself to him. Howe that happened was that I told Raju what I felt: “Though I I going to fit this role? I am 43 now and by the time we 44 and I have to play a 20-year-old so I don’t think I am film. I personally feel you should cast someone in that a to help him find a younger actor for the role. My fear wa if people didn’t accept me as a 20-year-old, then the who toss. And that would not be worth it. You are making an e much hard work involved so why should you let the fate of weak point.

Instead You have chased excellence and success has come after tha the audience is going to believe you as opposed to some o chasing success in reality but spouts these lines on scre credibility to the character and that is why I want you t opinion was but I kept insisting on finding a younger act on. What eventually helped me make up my mind was Raju’s 363 a lot of time together and discussed many drafts of the process Raju was certain that he wanted me for the role. as a director. I trust his judgement and instinct. I migh in a particular way but if the director is able to see me and excited about it, then that is important to me. I am so glad he pushed me. I decided to go with Raju’s ju my intense desire to work with him and, of course, what h me to take on the challenge. Once you were convinced and you signed the film, what was to Rancho? I felt Rancho is boyish and transparent. He has a clean h thinks and feels is quite evident to people. Had I actual have played the character differently. I don’t know how I it would have been different. At this age, I had the addi playing a guy half my age. I had to approach him differen mannerisms and the way I look to cut the age. I was reall so I lost a lot of muscle. I tried to look as small as po I wore oversized clothes. I had to internalise the manner internalise them, they come out totally fake. In my head, him, I felt he is a guy who is constantly moving. His min stays still. He is either scratching his head, shifting f shaking his head. He is quick. There is so much going on lot of buzz in him. That is how I saw him. And because he is going on inside him comes out spontaneously. This trai smart lines because the lines are very smart. I felt that cocky, then he will become a pain in the neck after a poi the audience has to feel he is innocent. Let me give you my toughest scenes in the film was when Rancho confronts death. Those are some pretty heavy lines. You might feel go and tell the head of your educational institute all th him without being asked anything is a rather extreme thin of Rancho’s words is severe. How does one pull this off? at one point to have Rancho drunk in this scene but then route. The best way then to go about it, and which is wha him as emotionally overwrought. He is so grief-stricken t 364 he feels without thinking of the consequences. And the o outspokenness of the earlier scene would be to show a deg the Director's office the next morning. He is not taking this like a challenge. He is making a plea. I am saying a Director and, therefore, I cannot come from a position of Basically, I played Rancho with a different attitude. He because he is innocent enough to be honest. He might be s say what he feels because that is who he is. The smart li retained but as an actor, I had to say them in a way that Farhan and Raju, as characters, were most likely to have them because most people would identify either with Farha Rancho is a man you admire but not someone who evokes sym Was this a concern for you? I was aware of this but it was not a concern for me. One Rancho, speaking from a purely dramatic point of view, is When the character does not have flaws, you may admire th emotionally connect with the character because he does no does not need your help. And he is succeeding in whatever is no sympathy or empathy for him. As an audience you don in him. For example, in Taare Zameen Par, your heart goes you see the trouble he is going through. You are totally is a very author-backed character. The characters in 3 /d a strong emotional connect with the audience are Farhan a two who have problems. There is a growth in these charact transformation through the film. In Rancho, there is no g from the beginning to the end. It was a very big challeng because emotionally he is not author-backed. His only pro but cannot marry her. But that is not the main plot. This was essential to not make him oversmart. He would have go I warned Raju about this in the beginning that we would h this guy or he would be in danger of going overboard. I t have to be careful as a director and watch out and not le And I think somewhere what works for Rancho is the screen screenplay really supports him. The story is about two fr 365 their friend. It is through their intensity, their warmt that the audience emotionally connects with Rancho, Whene I always cried in Farhan’s scene with his father and Raju but I never cried for Rancho. I never felt bad for him. I him emotionally. That came from the bonding and love that brought for Rancho in their performances. The warmth they seeps through to the audience. Again, at another level, t because throughout the film, you are looking for Rancho a flashes of him through Farhan’s eyes. We have not met him head-on only at the end where he is himself and not a per at from someone else’s point of view. The tenderness, love, and warmth the three friends share Rancho. The emotional high point for Rancho’s character i waiting nervously for his friends to return from the situ his father and Raju goes for a job interview) they have g moment he realises that they have returned triumphant fro breaks down. You were not convinced about Joy’s suicide being in the f You opposed it vehemently. Why was that? At the script level, I felt that it might not be necessar through in any case. It is accomplished through Virus’s c committed suicide. But the actual reason is a connected t retained, then the two scenes that came right after it wo negotiate for me. I was not convinced that people would b like we just discussed, Rancho is saying some very provoc the Director. See, either the tone of the film is at such this to the Director is alright because the entire film i doing that. So this worried me. The graveyard scene and t tough. Right after those is the classroom scene where he of the Director and getting away with it. That line was a Sir, mein aap ko engineering nahin sikha raha, mein to aa padhate kaise hain.” (1 am not teaching you engineering S to teach). I thought the audience would beat us for this. to carry this off. I thought it would be best for Rancho up his bag, and bolt out of there. If I had said these li 366 a manner which suggested that I was taking on the Direct been doomed. But coming back to Joy’s suicide, in hindsight, when I se was right about keeping the suicide just like he was righ that he took.

The only thing that we changed was his body lan that it might be interesting to have a man who constantly a race and his every habit is geared towards saving time, in his own movements. He walks and moves slowly, but duri did not work at all so we changed it. All this really hel a character. This is your first film with Aamir Khan. He is the protag antagonist so to speak in 3 Idiots. What was the experien This script was narrated to everyone from Hrithik to Shah why Aamir was not considered but eventually he is the one a perfect fit for the role. He is amazing to work with in 373 commitment, courtesy. The experience of working with him thing about Aamir is that, the equation is not of two co- of two colleagues, two collaborators. No one is working a us become a team and our goal — the film. During the interviews, everyone told me that Raju pampers anyone else on the sets? Is that true? Who told you that? Tell me? (laughing) Were Sharman, Raju about this? I am sure they were. This is just what everyo everyone. No special favours extended to me. Hf RAJU RASTOGI: SHARMAN JOSHI Sharman was on my radar since the time my wife, Manjeet, in Style. We had both really liked him and I wanted to wo right role came along. — Rajkumar Hirani Sharman Joshi would have frequented the theatres more had movie watching would reap such rich benefits.

Though tempted to walk up to him and introduce hesitated thinking that this might not be the right place was pleasantly surprised when on spotting him, Raju smile Confidence boosted, Sharman walked up to him. But bigger surprises were in store for Sharman that night had a role for him but since he was still in the process in touch with him soon. Sharman went home in a daze. How did 3 Idiots come together for you? I believe that th multiplexes have played an important role? (Smiles) The first time Raju Sir told me he had a role fo meeting in the compound of a cinema hall. Though I did no for a few months, after that I knew that the offer was fo 374 you meet Raju Sir, you can feel the honesty and sincerit sweet-talking types. So I was assured in my mind that som of our meeting. But as luck would have it, we bumped into at a multiplex (PVR in Juhu). We met in the restroom afte stood there chatting for 15 minutes. Again, a few months bumped into each other in the restroom of the same multip time during the interval. Raju and I joked that slowly we beginning of the film. Three chance meetings at cinema ha Finally, we connected and I went and met him at his offic supposed to be a casual one but I think Raju was so excit narrated the entire script to me. This would be approxima first meeting in the compound of a cinema hall.

Once Aamir came in, I was constantly in to during the in-between period, I did not bother him at all thing happened. What was your first reaction to the script? I loved the script and even though they still had to make me, I went out that night and celebrated. I didn’t even k would play — Farhan or Raju — if I was doing the film. I characters so it would not have mattered to me which one Shahrukh was playing Rancho but later Aamir came in, and for both the parts. I had read Five Point Someone so for I had come with some pre-conceived notions about the diff For example, in the book, Alok’s character is rather weak about that. But once the script was narrated to me, the c different and was not weak. By the time Aamir was finalis happened, script narrations started, and then the auditio playing either part because I felt both had a lot of scop meat and challenge. What is beautiful about working with little change, Raju involves everyone. His humility is on truly and honestly respects every individual. I was pleas gave me a pen and pad and asked me to jot down what I fel 375 if I had any inputs, these could be discussed. He likes importantly, that participation is truly appreciated.

I was drawn to the script because it is about finding you Farhan confronts his father and his job interview are the the human element in the film and the journey of these tw themselves through various experiences. You said that you auditioned for both Raju and Farhan? Di like both the roles equally? Raju Sir being Raju Sir gave me the option of auditioning I wanted to play. This he did in the first meeting itself there with pre-conceived notions so I had my apprehension I felt about Alok’s character. He just smiled and narrate the narration, he asked me the same question. My answer t whichever one he would like me to audition for. I had und characters were solid. He made me audition for Raju. Then made me audition for Farhan. Eventually, he made me play Raju’s character. Frankly, th that I really didn’t have to do much. This script is rema is the way it has been executed. For an actor, half the j Before the first schedule began, I read the script many t progression of the entire script from any given point in the Bible, therefore, whichever scene we shot for, I play head, followed the progression and performed it according set were the script, Raju Sir, and my instincts. For all the drunken scenes in the film, I believe you peo ‘What was that experience like? We had a blast shooting the water tank scene and the one house. It was so much fun. The night at the water tank we 376 We gave lengthy takes. The production team finally asked they were running out of stock though I don’t think that just wanted us to pack up (laughs). The night after that, house. Vinod Chopra was with us that night so he also dra trailer. After a few drinks, he said: “Koi bhi bahar ka d producer hai, khud bhi pee raha hai aur apne actors ko bh ho gayi to kya hoga?” (If anyone from outside the unit we would wonder what kind of a producer I am — not only am I also making my actors drink. What will happen if the shoo Not by design but by chance, Aamir, Madhavan, and you wer the ‘3 Idiots’ and you had worked with each other before What was it like on the sets? I was ecstatic when Aamir came in. We already had an equa life was going to be on the sets and that made me very ha Raju Sir on the sets and he was a pleasure as well. I was would be on the sets. I think he was a bit paranoid in th was a lot of responsibility and pressure on him. He neede I started to feel the pressure too. It was a Raju Hirani predictably, there were a lot of expectations.

Also, Raju Sir really pamper tease him about pampering Boman more and Boman would prot is a complete sense of freedom with Raju Sir.

Did you audition for both the roles or was it always Farh Farhan was the only role I related to when I heard the sc only Farhan in mind as far as I was concerned.

How did 3 Idiots happen and what drew you to the material plans or inclination to be part of Hindi Cinema?

Then Raju called me that though I had done a great job someone had taught me lines. He was right because my mom had taught me. He told Hindi as this character would know very little Hindi. The that, therefore, if I wanted the role, I would have to st watching Hindi movies. He did not want my interpretation performance to be affected by such factors.
