I happ Mapuskar’s film Ferrari ki Sawari. During that time, we w casting for 3 Idiots. Aamir asked me if there was anythin he was keen to work with him. I immediately called him in And just like that, we found Rancho. — Vidhu Vinod Chopra In the twenty-six years that Aamir Khan has spent in the Vidhu Vinod Chopra have met and spoken about several proj offered 1942: A Love Story to Aamir but that fell through accustomed to Vinod calling him once every few years and dates for projects that were to begin shooting a month la hear the script but decline because he needed more time t reasoned that if Vinod called him barely a month before t for a project was to begin, then he was anyway not the ma the job. So when in late 2007, his phone rang with Vinod’s name fl screen, Aamir assumed that it was one of Vinod’s regular Vinod had called to discuss a project still in the proces conversation went something like this ... Aamir: “Yaar tu mujhe yeh sab filmein offer karta rehta h offer me a film with Raju?” (You keep offering me these films but why don’t you ever with Raju?) 360 Vinod: “Bulaonga to karega tu?” (IFT call you, will you do it?) Aamir: “Script achchi lagegi to zaroor karoonga.” (If I like the script, I will definitely do it.) Vinod: “To phir aaja kal aur sunn le.” (Then come tomorrow and hear it.) Unaware that Raju had a ready script or was even working stunned by the turn of events. Vinod had managed to stump But this time things did work out. You had expressed a desire to work with Raju. Both of you discussed a project. Why did things not work out earlier? I have very high regard for Raju’s work and for Raju as a we met was at the premiere of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. | loved it was wonderful. A little over six months after that, Ra idea he had for a film. This was before Lage Raho. 1 was decided to meet the moment I was back in town. After I re meet me and told me that things had changed. In fact, the met, he decided that the idea he was to share with me, wo the second innings of Munna Bhai. 1 was still curious to I heard it, I thought it was a fantastic idea and complet genre. And Sanjay would do a great job but at the same ti missed out on an opportunity. What drew me to Raju was his unique style of filmmaking. two Munna Bhai films that he views his characters with a it is a bad guy in his film, his approach to the characte there is a certain joy and simplicity which is what appea Also, Raju is a straightforward person who you take to in and regard for each and every person he deals with, no ma After the first narration, what was your reaction to the My first reaction to the script was one of disappointment and if Raju had still wanted to make it the way it was th 361 opt out. I felt sad because I really wanted to work with of potential but it was not in place as yet. I expressed He heard me out and said that he agreed with quite a few me to give him some time and then he came back after abou I heard the script the second time round, I liked it. A l and he had agreed with, had been addressed. ‘What were the problems that you had with the first versi was narrated to you? My basic problem was that Rancho was too heroic in the fi and belting out one smart line after another. I felt he s guy. For example, in the introduction scene, initially, h faced the guys who were ragging him. It was Rancho’s atti that was a problem for me. The scene has stayed pretty mu been earlier. Rancho’s attitude did not make sense to me. into the first year should be scared when he faces his se guy who comes in and churns out smart lines. He came acro and too sure of himself. But as I understood him, he seem normal. He does not really know how to face guys who are are bullying him. That is the reason he runs away and hid The tone initially was of one-upmanship and I felt that R care about that. I wanted him to be scared in the ragging of fear and not out of knowing how to handle these tough in the scene where the Director addresses the first year about the astronaut’s pen, had I said my lines in a cocky would have comes across differently but when the lines ar excitement as though the idea has just occurred to the ch is a damn good one, so he just says it out loud because h takes on a different colour altogether. Rancho is enthusi and shares them spontaneously but he does not know why th because he has not said anything meaning to be funny. Yet joke. Other people find it funny. This is broadly what I was the crystallisation of the core thought that I was ex is trying to say — chase excellence and not success — and coming through in Rancho. 362 You were not convinced about playing a 20-year-old stude made you change your mind? When I read the script, I did not feel that Rancho is me naturally brilliant guy and I don’t see myself as that. R all along I have been following but as a personality he i myself as that. But broadly speaking, how he lives his li mine but when I was reading the script, I didn’t see it t myself that way, so I couldn’t relate myself to him. Howe that happened was that I told Raju what I felt: “Though I I going to fit this role? I am 43 now and by the time we 44 and I have to play a 20-year-old so I don’t think I am film. I personally feel you should cast someone in that a to help him find a younger actor for the role. My fear wa if people didn’t accept me as a 20-year-old, then the who toss. And that would not be worth it. You are making an e much hard work involved so why should you let the fate of weak point. Your lead actor is 44 and he is going to play not being convinced of it ourselves, if we still went ahe it looked bad, then what were we going to do? This is whe length. I think during our interaction leading up to this become increasingly convinced about me playing Rancho. Ma was not totally convinced. I don’t know what was going th that somewhere along the way, he became surer about me do the interaction helped him in his head as well. The first thought I looked young. Second, he felt that I could pull pulled off things that people have not expected me to. He Ghajini. His logic was that if I could pull that off, why him by saying that there were limits to what one can do p “Throughout your career, you have been like Rancho. You h unconventional. You have not followed any rules. Instead You have chased excellence and success has come after tha the audience is going to believe you as opposed to some o chasing success in reality but spouts these lines on scre credibility to the character and that is why I want you t opinion was but I kept insisting on finding a younger act on. What eventually helped me make up my mind was Raju’s 363 a lot of time together and discussed many drafts of the process Raju was certain that he wanted me for the role. as a director. I trust his judgement and instinct. I migh in a particular way but if the director is able to see me and excited about it, then that is important to me. I am so glad he pushed me. I decided to go with Raju’s ju my intense desire to work with him and, of course, what h me to take on the challenge. Once you were convinced and you signed the film, what was to Rancho? I felt Rancho is boyish and transparent. He has a clean h thinks and feels is quite evident to people. Had I actual have played the character differently. I don’t know how I it would have been different. At this age, I had the addi playing a guy half my age. I had to approach him differen mannerisms and the way I look to cut the age. I was reall so I lost a lot of muscle. I tried to look as small as po I wore oversized clothes. I had to internalise the manner internalise them, they come out totally fake. In my head, him, I felt he is a guy who is constantly moving. His min stays still. He is either scratching his head, shifting f shaking his head. He is quick. There is so much going on lot of buzz in him. That is how I saw him. And because he is going on inside him comes out spontaneously. This trai smart lines because the lines are very smart. I felt that cocky, then he will become a pain in the neck after a poi the audience has to feel he is innocent. Let me give you my toughest scenes in the film was when Rancho confronts death. Those are some pretty heavy lines. You might feel go and tell the head of your educational institute all th him without being asked anything is a rather extreme thin of Rancho’s words is severe. How does one pull this off? at one point to have Rancho drunk in this scene but then route. The best way then to go about it, and which is wha him as emotionally overwrought. He is so grief-stricken t 364 he feels without thinking of the consequences. And the o outspokenness of the earlier scene would be to show a deg the Director's office the next morning. He is not taking this like a challenge. He is making a plea. I am saying a Director and, therefore, I cannot come from a position of Basically, I played Rancho with a different attitude. He because he is innocent enough to be honest. He might be s say what he feels because that is who he is. The smart li retained but as an actor, I had to say them in a way that Farhan and Raju, as characters, were most likely to have them because most people would identify either with Farha Rancho is a man you admire but not someone who evokes sym Was this a concern for you? I was aware of this but it was not a concern for me. One Rancho, speaking from a purely dramatic point of view, is When the character does not have flaws, you may admire th emotionally connect with the character because he does no does not need your help. And he is succeeding in whatever is no sympathy or empathy for him. As an audience you don in him. For example, in Taare Zameen Par, your heart goes you see the trouble he is going through. You are totally is a very author-backed character. The characters in 3 /d a strong emotional connect with the audience are Farhan a two who have problems. There is a growth in these charact transformation through the film. In Rancho, there is no g from the beginning to the end. It was a very big challeng because emotionally he is not author-backed. His only pro but cannot marry her. But that is not the main plot. This was essential to not make him oversmart. He would have go I warned Raju about this in the beginning that we would h this guy or he would be in danger of going overboard. I t have to be careful as a director and watch out and not le And I think somewhere what works for Rancho is the screen screenplay really supports him. The story is about two fr 365 their friend. It is through their intensity, their warmt that the audience emotionally connects with Rancho, Whene I always cried in Farhan’s scene with his father and Raju but I never cried for Rancho. I never felt bad for him. I him emotionally. That came from the bonding and love that brought for Rancho in their performances. The warmth they seeps through to the audience. Again, at another level, t because throughout the film, you are looking for Rancho a flashes of him through Farhan’s eyes. We have not met him head-on only at the end where he is himself and not a per at from someone else’s point of view. The tenderness, love, and warmth the three friends share Rancho. The emotional high point for Rancho’s character i waiting nervously for his friends to return from the situ his father and Raju goes for a job interview) they have g moment he realises that they have returned triumphant fro breaks down. You were not convinced about Joy’s suicide being in the f You opposed it vehemently. Why was that? At the script level, I felt that it might not be necessar through in any case. It is accomplished through Virus’s c committed suicide. But the actual reason is a connected t retained, then the two scenes that came right after it wo negotiate for me. I was not convinced that people would b like we just discussed, Rancho is saying some very provoc the Director. See, either the tone of the film is at such this to the Director is alright because the entire film i doing that. So this worried me. The graveyard scene and t tough. Right after those is the classroom scene where he of the Director and getting away with it. That line was a Sir, mein aap ko engineering nahin sikha raha, mein to aa padhate kaise hain.” (1 am not teaching you engineering S to teach). I thought the audience would beat us for this. to carry this off. I thought it would be best for Rancho up his bag, and bolt out of there. If I had said these li 366 a manner which suggested that I was taking on the Direct been doomed. But coming back to Joy’s suicide, in hindsight, when I se was right about keeping the suicide just like he was righ that he took. The principal photography of the film began in August 200 Ladakh, the climax of the film, if not shot in the first to be shot after a year as Ladakh is only accessible for The decision was made to shoot the climax in Ladakh in th itself. Do you think it would have affected performances it at the beginning and not a year later which is what yo of terrible weather? I was very relieved that we could not shoot the entire cl it was a terrible experience for the entire team. We shot weather hits. It was scary how we evacuated everyone to s ends well. Our performances would have suffered because w characters as yet. Especially mine. At least Sharman and Bengaluru for the first few scenes of the film and, there a connect but my first day of shooting for 3 /diots was i that I was very happy because it would certainly have com we were able to bring in when we shot for it after shooti You actually drank for your drunken scenes. Method acting I actually find it difficult to do drunken scenes without performance if I actually drink and perform. I believe in my best performance and if anything helps in achieving th I am not one of those people who shy away from using thin their performance and eventually the film. What do you think is the core of 3 Idiots? Chase excellence and not success is definitely the core t do what you believe in and what makes you happy. What mak not always be conducive to what we commonly understand as wants to be a wildlife photographer and it may not appear 367 be successful doing that even in the conventional way.

So you conventional way as well by doing what makes you happy bu makes you happy, what is fulfilling to you.

Th to wait for a week, and exactly a week later, Raju called finished and I was called in for a narration. I went for certainty that I would do this film. Nothing was going to the script. My first reaction was that this film would cr to be a part of it. I knew that the film belonged to the terms of screen-time would be small but this would be a g and only a fool would pass up this opportunity. I have wo for nearly a decade and this was the most real and evocat ever heard. Also, it was my chance to work with Raju Hira romance in his work are unmatched. He does not have to tr York, London, San Francisco, or build opulent sets or dra to create magic. He plays with the magic of moments, of s just moves you and stirs something deep within. I was in to change my mind. With Raju, you got Aamir as a bonus. It took a decade for come together. Surely there must have been opportunities There had been opportunities before this but nothing work to do Ghajini but when Murgadoss approached me for Ghajin Mani Ratnam’s Lajjo with Aamir. Aamir called me and said two back-to-back films with me. I opted out of Ghajini an Unfortunately, Lajjo was shelved. Vishal Bharadwaj was al with us.

He kept assuring me and pro give me one of the best films of his career. And today th feels like a dream. I am in 3 /diots and it is Aamir Khan lucky for the Kapoor sisters. Both, Karisma and I have gi him. I keep teasing Aamir: “You do one film in three year another heroine will get a chance to work with you. It wi Samaira (laughs).” Aamir is truly a genius. He is a gift 369 Pia is very different from the roles you have done so fa approach to Pia? Pia is real. She is spontaneous and outspoken. I have rec than I did for Geet from Jab We Met. Geet was euphoric, m life. Every girl wanted to be like Geet but Pia’s USP is touches a cord across all age groups. I was shooting Kurb as I was shooting for 3 Idiots. Kurbaan was such an inten other hand, is very real and these are roles much tougher heroine has to break away from her identity and image and This is where Raju’s brilliance comes in. On the sets of that’s what everybody saw. Kareena vanished for the time 3 Idiots. And Pia has made such an impact that it has lef this would happen and that is why the length of my role w ever thought of me as Kareena here. Though I was the only was doing multiple projects at the time, I gave priority first film I was doing with Raju, Vinod, and Aamir. At the time of the narration, I am sure, you must have lo confrontation between Pia and her father (Virus). That is belonged to you. Was that a part of the extensive rehears before the principal photography for the film began? This ia my favourite scene in the film. When I heard this would be my big opportunity and the centrepiece of my per to nail it. I had come fully prepared for it. Raju was ve scene. I am a spontaneous actress and too much rehearsing listened to me which was very nice of him. I requested hi I felt that the entire scene was set up in such a way tha it was to be spontaneous. The scene begins with Pia clear feel by the way she is putting away the plates and the sp explode. This was done in a single take. I don’t know wha not use glycerin. The moment I finished the shot, I expec a sound but there was complete silence on the floor. I pa messed up the scene. Raju removed the headphones. He had the entire crew gave me a thunderous applause. I was prep while and I knew if I did not get this right, then there 370 You did a drunken scene on screen for the first time in What was that experience like? Raju was really worried about this scene. I have never ev and I am a teetotaler. This stretched on for fifteen to t scenes are not easy to do. It is very tough to get the co and the slurs have to be the same. To make the job at han sync-sound film. Aamir helped me a lot in that scene. He centre of my forehead so that my eyes look a little cross I could drink if that helped me perform. These boys had d earlier and they had actually got drunk for it. Aamir kep glass of wine. I told them that this route would not work any alcohol I would just fall asleep instantly. There were so many takes we did. Finally, Raju asked us t was fed up. He said he would manage something in the edit thinking maybe I could not deliver as per expectations. B and people went wild about the dhokla-fafada scene. Fans from the scene and I went crazy with the kind of response because he had used a ‘No-Good’ take. Normally, actresses get the opportunity to do a drunken scene and when they d nail.

Interestingly, Virus’s d nap whilst listening to opera and getting his shave done Gandhi's life.

Being ambidextrous my perception of Virus was that he is a genius. He is not he has chosen to devote his life to numbers instead of ap pursuits. The only thing that we changed was his body lan that it might be interesting to have a man who constantly a race and his every habit is geared towards saving time, in his own movements. He walks and moves slowly, but duri did not work at all so we changed it. All this really hel a character. This is your first film with Aamir Khan. He is the protag antagonist so to speak in 3 Idiots. What was the experien This script was narrated to everyone from Hrithik to Shah why Aamir was not considered but eventually he is the one a perfect fit for the role. He is amazing to work with in 373 commitment, courtesy. The experience of working with him thing about Aamir is that, the equation is not of two co- of two colleagues, two collaborators. No one is working a us become a team and our goal — the film. During the interviews, everyone told me that Raju pampers anyone else on the sets? Is that true? Who told you that? Tell me?
