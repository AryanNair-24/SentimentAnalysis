On the night of the suicide, Rancho goe the campus, rings the bell, gathers the students and deli form, the scene became too dramatic, grim, and preachy.

The grey of the cemetery an the grim and colourless tone that we needed. This scene, core of 3 Idiots. Why should people be killing themselves with the system. Why is everyone running after grades and is what the film addresses and attacks. VC: I agree with Abhijat. 3 /diots questions the system a to chase grades leads students to give in to pursuits tha their choice and compels them to take the set and decided goals. This only leads to suicides or mediocrity. Chasing Excellence over success is a philosophy I have always fol take some very irrational decisions that have made no bus the pursuit was for quality, in the long run, success cam It is a very personal film.

He is a brilliant, free-spirite chasing what he is interested in most. Probably a person unfathomable today so Rancho might seem unreal to some bu real. My first thoughts on Rancho were that he is a boy f no experience with formal education so he does not know t speaks to them as he speaks to everyone. I could have dwe and background a little more in the film to bring this to felt that it was not necessary. Rancho lives by his philo makes choices which are absurd conventionally but he is n he does not feel the need to. VC: Why does he appear superhuman? It was very easy for R me to flesh out Rancho as we understand him completely. I of myself in Rancho. There are just too many similarities in my school.

I can draw many parallels but the point I am making is th unbelievable, fictional, larger-than-life character. He i little tough to understand in this world because he does happy sitting back and accepting whatever is doled out th is considered an aberration. AJ: While writing, we did not look at Rancho as a charact hero of the film and he has been written like that, thoug nor a comic book hero. He has the attributes of a hero an to pretend otherwise. He is an uninhibited free spirit wi genuine queries. He does not operate with arrogance or co also played him with that inherent earnestness. But it wo that he does not have an arc in the film or a journey. Hi from Joy’s suicide. He would not have taken on the system perfectly wonderful boy was driven to suicide because of ruthless system education has been reduced to. This stirs he cannot ignore. A clear inspiration and influence here Amitabh Bachchan is a daily wage worker at the dockyard. to pay extortion money to Peter, the local goon. One man he is killed by the goons.

Next w will not pay the extortion money to the goons), goes the this death which changes him, Amitabh would have remained 330 to earn his daily wages. This incident, its futility and writing Rancho, Raju and I had discussed this scene from suicide is a turning point in Rancho’s life. This is his of his own journey, he changes lives including his own. Like Rancho, Virus’s character must have been a challenge achieve balance there? RH: During Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., we were shooting a scene to deliver a speech to the students. He improvised and ad doctor should be dispassionate towards his patients. He m distance to give him perspective. The exact line was: “Ag karoonga to mere haath kampenge.” While scripting this, m that this argument is so logical and valid that it comple character.

His intention is not to go out there and harm life is a race and if you don’t run fast enough, you woul his point of view and he is unwavering in his belief. The film starts with Farhan abandoning a flight that has was a long process before you arrived at this opening for drafts I read, several approaches were tried including th contemplating bringing in Amitabh Bachchan as the narrato opening scene and why was this scene the most appropriate RH: The starting point is always tough. The idea was to s large activity which Farhan has to abandon at the very me was done to establish the importance of Rancho in Farhan’ AJ: Though we went along with the airplane scene to open alternate scene that happens to be my favourite. Given a instead of this. In my favoured beginning, Farhan is a li of a conversation between two Heads of State at the UN.

But these things are a matter of explorati possibilities and then chooses the one that best works fo Joy’s suicide was a critical point of debate. There are d several that did not. Its inclusion was probably most fie entire screenplay. It was felt that this was too dark an that it might dilute the revelation of Virus’s son’s deat was the thought behind the suicide scene and the reason f 20 minutes of getting into the film? VC: There was a lot of back and forth that happened over doubts about whether we should include this or not. But w that this gave motivation to Rancho’s character. Raju too adding a montage and a voice-over at the editing stage. T with Farhan’s voice-over talking about Rancho and his qui there the voice-over says, “Ek aur tha bilkul Rancho jais voice-over that Raju introduced at the editing table, int the script. Otherwise, it would have been too much of a j that a brilliant guy like Rancho can go one way or the ot Phunsukh Wangdu or become so dejected by seeing mediocrit that he gives up on life. RH: Joy’s suicide was thrown out and brought back innumer and I were very keen to keep it as we felt that the confl from there, otherwise it would just be a fun film without it. Vinod and Aamir felt that it should not be there. The too dark and grim. It was a jarring inclusion in the film convinced that this had to be there. This went on for a l got it back into the script a month before the shoot star But the debate over it continued and then finally the mon during the edit, settled the matter. Earlier, the Rancho the film. We had not even planned to keep it.

I added the mon 332 it with Joy’s introduction by that voice-over, made Joy and also lent him credibility. AJ: Joy’s suicide is the spine of the film. The second-ha devices. But Joy’s suicide is what makes Rancho realise t is the killer and it has to be fought. It is this belief and the story forward. Otherwise, why is he doing the thi first half of the film would become insubstantial if we t The challenge was to put this thing that worries us about so that we know what Rancho is fighting, and the film is the weight of this intense scene. The interval point is a bit of a shock. The tone of the s are unlike the rest of the film. There were other interva well before arriving at this one. How did this come about RH: I wanted the fact that Rancho is an imposter to be re I felt if we stretched revealing this till the interval, very rich kid had come into a college and was having fun. needed to be told as quickly in the film as possible that it would get the audience to feel for him. So in the earl the flashback one more time in the first half to reveal t Rancho but an imposter. Then we went back into the flashb different interval point (Farhan and Raju discovering tha being one of the options considered). But after a lot of script, I felt that the interval would be a great point t Rancho but an imposter. Sometimes, I still feel that it m reveal this earlier even though what we eventually put in point. In the end, these are choices that one makes. So o was going to be the interval point, we narrated it to Vin add the element of the college photograph having a differ appealed to me as it enhanced the scene. VC: Unlike the West, Indian cinema does not follow the th a two-act deal. It is a very unusual way of watching movi world watches films like this — you see one part of the f chai, then you watch the rest of the film. This makes the critical. Therefore, one must invest a lot of thought in happen. In this film, my thought process was focussed on 333 the audience when they would go and buy their popcorn. B to come back to find out what happens next in the film is the suggestion, I did not think that Raju would retain it quality to the twist. I felt that the audience would enjo time I told Raju, he said he liked it but I do not believ evening. It is an age-old joke between us that I am the ‘ he is the ‘next morning guy’. He likes to mull over and t He makes up his mind only after that. So I always go with things the next morning and not on the evening that they happy that he retained it. The film initially ended with these people finding Rancho in a school, leading a simple happy life doing what he lo ‘Wangdu was not in the film at all. How did the idea of P fall into place? RH: Yes, that is true. Phunsukh Wangdu was not in the fil ended with Farhan, Raju, and Pia reaching Ladakh and disc teaches in this fascinating little school and that is his to do, he did it. But we felt that maybe the audience wou They would probably say that ‘yaar khush to hain, lekin p na” (He might be happy but he earns very little money). W audience understand, we had to show him to be successful way. This is the reason we added the Phunsukh Wangdu, cov and backtracked to plant him in the film. This is where C He was shown to be looking for someone in the entire film man he is searching for is Rancho. The idea was to show a out of choice. Rancho has the option of signing a deal wi millions but he has chosen to do differently. We felt thi understand things better. Another reason was that we kept feeling that the climax w that our climax was the delivery and then we were just wr Ladakh. It felt weak. We, however, were doing a lot of th were showing an unusual school. As Farhan, Raju, and Pia see (an entire scene was there intially) that a race is g and one kid falls down. Instead of carrying on, all the k him up and then proceed to finish the rest of the race. T 334 other and say that this can only be Rancho’s school. Cha initially had Millimeter in it. So all this material was not coming together to result in a spectacular end to the Phunsukh Wangdu, things started falling into place. But t get it all together at the end took us a lot of time. Fin a big twist at the end. We solved the Phunsukh Wangdu riddle in our heads in Goa. a writing visit to Mumbai. I received a call to attend th (IFFI, end 2007). We decided to travel to Goa for two day reason to get away from Mumbai and write. We stayed at th one where we had shot the Lage Raho song with the old peo excited about it. He has this fascination for revisiting Except for the chief minister’s party the night we had ar the festival at all. We took a long walk on the beach the Phunsukh Wangdu fell into place. It was quite magical and with the climax after that. Phunsukh Wangdu, the real identity of Rancho, is revealed point of revelation that Rancho is actually Phunsukh Wang you battled with for over a year. What made you decide th RH: This was a tough one to decide. We were unsure of thi before we shot the scene. Abhijat and I felt that it shou the friends reunite, before Chatur’s arrival. By doing th to the audience that Rancho was Phunsukh Wangdu, the man and Chatur’s dialogues and demeanour with Rancho after th become even more hilarious to the audience as they would in for a real shock when he found out that Rancho is Phun and Madhavan were of the view that the revelation should that the film ends on a high note. They felt that reveali this dramatic twist. This is when the tussle started. Abh long time but Aamir and Madhavan were so vehement and ins a question in our minds also. When I was in Ladakh for th feel that maybe their suggestion holds some weight. Maybe would be a great way to end the film. So I changed it and day before the shoot.

But Vir through screenings on other people and they died laughing nothing to do with sensibility because as Raju said, one of the film and not some general sensibility. Therefore, issues here. I just felt that the scene was getting too l stretch. My biggest concern is always that the audience s AJ: The speech scene was hilarious but I must say that it as a set piece for humour. It is the illustration and the of the ideologies which is the key element in the film. R learning that our education system encourages. He is comp ‘definition of a machine’ scene introduces that.

Ri have the scene where Chatur and Rancho lay a bet to meet who is more successful. The speech scene lent to the prog the film. The shloka at the end is another story. I knew that if I immediately want it in the film and that is what happened was unsure about it like Vinod and like he said, it was n issues. It was because I felt that Rancho probably would speech to this extent. He would change just two words and for him to drive the point home. But I am glad that Raju end because the shloka is the pitce de résistance of the The delivery scene has invited a lot of mixed reactions f audience. I remember you telling me that you began this f on the climax because that was a huge challenge you faced Raho? Frankly, what were you people thinking when you dec the concluding episode in the film? 337 RH: The origin of this scene is from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. scene where Munna gets admission into medical college.

The idea behind the scene realise the value and responsibilities of doctors. The mo this would have hit him. Now, he would really want to stu script underwent many changes and this route was abandone about it. While writing 3 Idiots, like I told you earlier first decide the climax. Abhijat and I talk a lot when we one of the scenes I mentioned again and Abhijat said, “Wh here?” Rancho could apply engineering for the delivery. T with a short story I had read somewhere about a man who u baby while he was still in his mother’s womb, connected w ‘Aal izz well’, our climax, started taking shape. Then, w gynaecologists to make it authentic. It became a big joke Vinod used to come to office and ask for us, he was told the gynaecologist. Everyone teased us endlessly about our One of my friends had introduced us to Dr. Sejal Desai wh while writing this scene. She told us about the various p could be delivered. The only procedure which could be com was the suction method. A lot of people think that this c scene is totally authentic and it is possible to deliver step, we consulted the doctors and, in a way, we wrote th lot of work, a lot of research, and a lot of time were sp the shoot, the doctors were there and constantly monitori and how it was being depicted. This is not one of those u things that we have put in the film for the sake of a gre You have often referred to the three scenes that constitu in the film as the soul of 3 Idiots: Raju’s job interview 338 with his father, and Rancho breaking down when they come about their triumphs. These scenes had several rewrites b final form in which they are in the film. Why do you feel the essence of 3 idiots? RH: These are the moments in the film I am most attached very emotional. Even while narrating these scenes, I woul emotion. In a way, I feel, they are the crux of the film. of an underdog succeeding. I like hope. I see victory in do whatever you want without fear. This is what one wants had to put a lot of work into these scenes. For example, happened in order to elevate the interview scene to the l to. It was written and rewritten several times. Initially things about fear, god, and superstition and he used to g scene was flat. It lacked punch and impact. Then we hit u which transformed the scene completely. How this happened is quiet remarkable as well. I had read about a small boy who is asked by his teacher to write an to become. The boy writes his essay describing his dream, day with thousands of horses. The teacher is not impresse this unrealistic aim to a more practical one. He tells hi more achievable as the boy comes from too poor a backgrou dream. He also threatens to fail him in the assignment if comes the next day and again submits the same assignment. now.

I narrated it to Abhijat and was itching to use it subconscious thought was to apply this somewhere in the s find the right moment or place for it. In the end, in a d this scene. I think the thought here is of preserving wha willing to give that up, then that is the first step towa your dreams. Farhan’s confrontation with his father, apar not an easy scene to execute. Even in the writing of it, satisfied with the trigger that makes the father come aro has to say more, do more. Something here was not working very unsure about executing the father’s change of heart. pitch, everything had to be perfect for this scene to wor 339 Abhijat. I was very restless about this.

You need to see the aftermath, otherwise it to pacing a film is as much in speeding it up as in slowi breathe when the screenplay demands it.

How does it work for both of you? AJ: Raju and I share the same sensibility. Our approaches that we want to take, are all the same. When Raju and I w follow is completely non-linear.

This is what leads to honest work. to bring in fresh ideas. It is very tough to do that thes be there to achieve this. AJ: I feel that novelty of idea is paramount. Anything yo to write should not have the sound of something that has times before. The approach that though it has been done b so well that it will work, according to me, does not work about the idea that you choose and you need to believe in to you to begin with.
