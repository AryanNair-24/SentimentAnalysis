She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man sleeps. She sneaks back into the bed, carefully positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her good parts. She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend sleeps.

0) 23) dialog: Me too, I'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awayâcause I'm doing really well at work.
0) 25) dialog: It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's science. I'm-I don't want a relationship either. Let's just say that. And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I'm just different from other girls.
0) 32) dialog: Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've cut hair before. He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.

2) 3) dialog: I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid now.
2) 5) dialog: I think I might be a little bit stupid.
2) 7) dialog: No! But I gave him a blow job.
2) 9) dialog: Well, he kept putting it in my face. Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh.
2) 26) dialog: At least you have someone. God, wha's wrong with me?
2) 33) dialog: I still don't think I do that.
2) 36) dialog: I brought him lemon-bars because I was making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're right, that's weird.
2) 41) dialog: Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist. Lillian laughs.
2) 43) dialog: Are you serious?
2) 50) dialog: God, I haven't seen you in months!
2) 54) dialog: Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here.

2) 112) dialog: Cool! They're making a WKRP movie.
2) 114) dialog: What? Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
2) 121) dialog: Lillian! What is that?!
2) 123) dialog: What?!!
2) 125) dialog: It's beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this is...this is crazy!
2) 128) dialog: That's not I mean. I mean, I remember when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember?
2) 130) dialog: No, I don't. It's just making me realize how long we've known each other.
2) 132) dialog: Oh my God! I don't know what to say!
2) 139) dialog: Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God. I've never been in a wedding.
2) 141) dialog: I know what you're doing. Don't downplay this. I'm happy for you. And someday when hell freezes over and I get married, you can be my Maid of Honor. But for right now, this is about you. OK? This is you're day, and it is a big deal.
2) 143) dialog: Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys set a date?
2) 145) dialog: Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and-- Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.
2) 147) dialog: Ooo, haha... Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room as her smile disappears. She remembers...
3) 2) dialog: Lillian Marie Donovan. Do you take your husband, forever, to be your husband? Lillian stands by a poster of Eric Estrada in his C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.

4) 6) dialog: Hello?
4) 8) dialog: Yes? It's HELEN (early 30's) Lillian's bridesmaid and friend from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots of candles glowing.

4) 20) dialog: Oh, thank you. Annie, reads â#2. Expose your best asset. ASAPâ She panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe, flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but politely smiles and goes back to his magazine.

4) 24) dialog: Yeah. It is quite an honor.
4) 26) dialog: I'm sorry, the what?

4) 40) dialog: Hey, you're dog's really cute.
4) 42) dialog: It's kinda funny right? That when girls are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs are cute. Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond.

6) 19) dialog: Mom I told you you don't have to send me--
6) 21) dialog: I love you too Mom. Bye. They hang up. Annie walks to the kitchen.
6) 24) dialog: Nevermind...
6) 26) dialog: Oh. Well, thank you.
6) 33) dialog: (looking at herself] That's actually a good idea. She starts to leave but sees a guilty look and some frosting on Steve's face. She looks over at her saran- 's.
6) 36) dialog: Ok, now really tell me the truth. How many did you eat?
6) 38) dialog: Shit! She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum.
6) 40) dialog: No. Was I speeding?
6) 48) dialog: Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out.
6) 50) dialog: I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the city and they've never pulled me over. To tell you the truth, those lights have been out for like a year.
6) 52) dialog: What? No.. I-
6) 54) dialog: Can you do that?
6) 56) dialog: Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will get the lights fixed tomorrow morning. I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my best friend's engagement party, I'm the Maid of honor and so I really -
6) 58) dialog: Am I getting a ticket? He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence.

6) 67) dialog: I don't remember.
6) 70) dialog: Oh, Okay.
6) 72) dialog: Oh yeah.

6) 85) dialog: Hi Mrs. Donovan! They hug.
6) 88) dialog: I know, I'm so happy for her.
6) 90) dialog: Nope.
6) 103) dialog: Hi.
6) 105) dialog: Lil! It was nice meeting you Mary. Annie leaves.
6) 117) dialog: Hey! What's up? Where's Dougie?
6) 121) dialog: This place is so fancy. Dougie's parents belong here?
6) 123) dialog: Oh. Wow. I guess it's not what I pictured. Lucky you.
6) 125) dialog: Oh! So where's this guy you were telling me about? LILLIAN. Oh shoot, Matt's not coming. I guess he got back together with his ex or something. Anyway, Dougie just told me. Sorry.
6) 126) dialog: That's ok.
6) 137) dialog: Leslie, hi! How are you guys?
6) 140) dialog: No, no. (to the guy) Hi. (to them) No. Annie meets DANA who is with her husband Ernie.

6) 152) dialog: No, I don't know him. He's not with me. He's just passing by. I'm not here with anyone. BECCA stands very close to her husband KEVIN, a good looking stockbroker type.
6) 162) dialog: 
6) 168) dialog: Megan! How are you?
6) 170) dialog: Oh shit!
6) 179) dialog: Wow. Well, I'm glad you're OK.
6) 186) dialog: Hi.
6) 189) dialog: Oh, the Starbuck's of the candle world? Those are popping up on every corner. Which one do you own?
6) 196) dialog: Oh, wow, that's pretty cule.
6) 198) dialog: That is a lot.
6) 201) dialog: Yeah, I was just telling Lillian i's very elegant.
6) 203) dialog: Yeah in the nice part. I work at Harrington's Jeweler's. I love it.
6) 205) dialog: It's pretty well-known in the jewelry world. It's got like the biggest market for all the jewelry they sell and 'm actually gonna be getting a promotion
6) 208) dialog: Yeah, so I'm pretty excited about it. It's gonna be...pretty big. So, if you ever need a discount--
6) 215) dialog: Thank you. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER. Groomsman DEAN finishes a speech. They are now in the dining room.
6) 218) dialog: Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary.
6) 230) dialog: Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla in here.
6) 232) dialog: Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what's that saying?
6) 239) dialog: Ayay, um, God, um, what is it? It's a good one, a good saying, it's Irish. It's like a-like a toast. Is it Irish? Something about a road...Oh God, 'm blanking. So I'll just say I'm so happy to be a part of this whole celebration and happiness. You two are so happy together and hope you have a happy lifetime of happiness and celebrating. And I love you and....Lillian, w've been best friends since we were like 5...'ve never been to Greece... 't know if she's done. Annie sees Helen has moved over to sit next to Lillian.
6) 242) dialog: Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing.
6) 244) dialog: God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech--
6) 251) dialog: I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party?
6) 255) dialog: I'm feeling slightly mortified.
6) 257) dialog: Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things?
6) 259) dialog: She just got engaged two weeks ago.
6) 261) dialog: Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen.
6) 274) dialog: (disappointed) Oh well...
6) 276) dialog: Oh, great! INT. HARRINTON'S. DONNA'S OFFICE. LUNCHTIME. Donna and Annie are eating lunch in the break-room.
6) 283) dialog: No, I got it.
6) 285) dialog: Sorry... Well, it's official. Lillian set a date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache.
6) 287) dialog: Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian.
6) 289) dialog: That dress is beautiful.
6) 291) dialog: Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write...
6) 298) dialog: Hi. I need to make these shorter.
6) 300) dialog: I know, it's... I can't work with them so long.
6) 302) dialog: Ok.
6) 304) dialog: Alright. INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. Annie looks up different bridesmaid dress shops EXT. âOCCASIONZ' BRIDAL SHOP. DAYTIME.
6) 305) dialog: Here it is!
6) 307) dialog: Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, I figured, we could maybe have lunch after. So, let's go! She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer.
6) 315) dialog: Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses.
6) 317) dialog: Oh, Annie.
6) 319) dialog: (to the girls) Oh, she must be talking about the restaurant. (back into the intercom) No, we're here to look at dresses.
6) 322) dialog: Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to make a reservation for that. Sorry! Anyway, we're all out here now and--
6) 324) dialog: Seven weeks?!
6) 333) dialog: What?
6) 337) dialog: No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so...
6) 340) dialog: No, no. I'll work it out. Don't worry.
6) 344) dialog: Yes, hello!
6) 361) dialog: Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses?
6) 370) dialog: Wow. That's amazing.
7) 0) text: Annie loves the dress she has on. She talks to herself in the mirror.
7) 1) dialog: Hi I'm Annie. Can I get a martini? What you mean you need to see I.D.? (giggling)
7) 9) dialog: Thank you. Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male model in a tuxedo.
7) 14) dialog: Hi.
7) 16) dialog: Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her.
7) 27) dialog: Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash--
7) 29) dialog: Huh?
7) 41) dialog: Well, what about this one? Everybody stops and looks at Annie.
7) 46) dialog: Or this one! People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time.
7) 53) dialog: I think Lillian would like this one.
7) 62) dialog: This dress is almost $500!
7) 64) dialog: No, that's what I'm saying. That's a great price.
7) 73) dialog: They only have salads.
7) 75) dialog: No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago.
7) 77) dialog: It just didn't work out.
7) 86) dialog: No it's fine. But he didn't steal the money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is really common right now. Everyone looks around.
7) 89) dialog: About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year.
7) 92) dialog: Very few HPV infections show any signs or symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner. Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..
7) 95) dialog: Oh, I didn't even think about that.
7) 105) dialog: Really?
7) 119) dialog: Yes.
8) 0) text: Annie is lost in thought. She hears. Sirens.
8) 1) dialog: What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches.
8) 3) dialog: Oh hi.
8) 5) dialog: I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I forgot(laughing). You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?
8) 7) dialog: I was?
8) 10) dialog: Yeah.
8) 17) dialog: Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness.
8) 21) dialog: Thanks.
8) 23) dialog: Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I get paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.
9) 1) dialog: Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time. Nothing says âI'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.
9) 5) dialog: I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that I'll never wear again.
10) 0) text: Annie is on the phone as she gets ready for her date with Mike.
10) 1) dialog: Help me! I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight.
10) 9) dialog: Listen, I'm going on a date. This? (holds up a dress) or this? (what she's wearing)
10) 11) dialog: What's wrong with'em?
10) 14) dialog: Shit. These are my only clean pants.
10) 16) dialog: Thanks Steve.
10) 18) dialog: I'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but I've always been interested in it. So, yeah I totally agree. Mike smiles, he is cute!
10) 25) dialog: Me too.
10) 27) dialog: I can do that drive in my sleep these days.
10) 30) dialog: Thank you. I brush'em every day. She flashes her teeth. The hostess comes up.
10) 34) dialog: So, Becca tells me you play a lot of tennis.
10) 41) dialog: Oh, yeah I haven't rea--
10) 45) dialog: No problem.
10) 49) dialog: No.
11) 0) text: Annie is on the phone, looking at the herbal drinks. âCalmâ âFocusâ âSex Appealâ âLeanâ. She f âCalmâ. RHODES appears holding a bag of mini carrots.
11) 1) dialog: Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night. Oh my God. Call me.
11) 3) dialog: Very funny, Officer...Jones?
11) 5) dialog: No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk.
11) 12) dialog: Yeah. Recovering from a date.
11) 14) dialog: Finish your cleanse?
11) 16) dialog: Thanks for the drink. (beat) So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people?
11) 18) dialog: That's a very good point.
11) 20) dialog: Yes. I'm starving.
11) 22) dialog: Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot.
11) 24) dialog: The what?
11) 31) dialog: No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.
11) 34) dialog: I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life.
11) 36) dialog: I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up.
11) 38) dialog: Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.
11) 39) dialog: It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's unpredictable. I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students.
11) 46) dialog: Hmm. I think I get it?
11) 48) dialog: Moonpies. What?
11) 50) dialog: Oh yeah.
11) 53) dialog: Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight.
11) 60) dialog: Sorry. (to clerk) Yeah I'll have the number four, and can you make that Super Biggie?
11) 64) dialog: Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I lived with broke up with me over the phone. Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that I'm still paying off. Because I can't find him.
11) 66) dialog: Oh my gosh. It's twelve thirty! I should probably...
11) 68) dialog: For me?!
11) 75) dialog: Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec? She waves at Rhodes and mouths...
11) 78) dialog: K. Bye.(to Ted) So, you're in town? EXT - TED'S HOUSE. NEXT MORNING. He opens the front door, leading Annie out again.
11) 80) dialog: No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I was just driving.
11) 82) dialog: Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.
11) 84) dialog: Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit card at the restaurant! Shit! She picks up her phone and dials.
11) 93) dialog: Hi!
11) 95) dialog: Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't that technically be me? Honor?
11) 97) dialog: Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy.
11) 104) dialog: Yes. Yes. I'm on it. Got some ideas. So I'll let you know.
11) 109) dialog: Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer.
11) 111) dialog: Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas?
11) 113) dialog: I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been.
11) 120) dialog: No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride.
11) 122) dialog: Well, I could save up for it.
11) 124) dialog: Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We see these words: âDear bridal partyâ, âgreat ide âbachelorette partyâ, âFloridaâ, âSea World!â place to stay!â. She presses send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately rings.
11) 127) dialog: Hi.
11) 134) dialog: Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames.
11) 136) dialog: Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days.
11) 138) dialog: Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it.
11) 140) dialog: Oh, can you hold on? That's my other line. She clicks over.
11) 141) dialog: Hello?

24) 22) dialog: No, it's a C.D. She rolls over and turns it off.
24) 24) dialog: I'm not.
24) 26) dialog: I already know what it's gonna be like. It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I don't wanna go.
25) 0) text: Annie drives to Helen's. She sees a pink and white highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit sign) âLillian's Shower Rue. This exitâ

25) 139) dialog: I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That's not who I am. I make bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls. I don't like Mike Donahue cause he () on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her.

30) 158) dialog: No, it's not. I don't know what happened. I messed everything up. Lillia's not even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening. Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent.
30) 160) dialog: Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled by the flash.
