4) 10) dialog: Hi.
4) 12) dialog: Hiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of Lillian's bridesmaids.
4) 19) dialog: Congratulations on being selected.
4) 21) dialog: Annie?
4) 23) dialog: Maid of Honor!!
4) 25) dialog: It's the number one spot. So how many times have you been in the B.P?
4) 27) dialog: Bridal Party?
4) 29) dialog: What!? I've never even heard of that.
4) 38) dialog: 
4) 46) dialog: YAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from Lilly with all of the other girls' information, and when you respond to any wedding related e-mails from now on, just remember to hit âREPLY ALLâ. Did you know there are six of us?
4) 53) dialog: Well, can't wait to meet you and hear what your planning for the bachelorette. Any ideas?
4) 55) dialog: Oop! There goes my other line. See you Friday! She realizes there might some research to do for this âbridal party' thing. She instead grabs two wedding magazines.
6) 185) dialog: Hiii.
6) 187) dialog: Hiii. This is my husband Perry.
6) 195) dialog: All of them. It's the family business, his father started it.
6) 199) dialog: Perry donated a few for tonight. The room is all aflame.
6) 202) dialog: So you live in Milwaukee?
6) 204) dialog: I think I've heard of them.
6) 214) dialog: You're funny. Listen Annie,I know you said you've never been in a wedding before so I just want you to know that we all have, especially me, so if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.
6) 217) dialog: Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris the Third, an honored member of the bridal party. In honor of Lillian and Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in Santorini. Annie whispers to the person next to her.
6) 219) dialog: With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every...scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make. Love conquers all. Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional.
6) 225) dialog: They say when you choose a mate, yo're choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo're a lucky man. Lillian, I know you're going to make a wonderful wife, because you have been the best friend that I could ever ask for. Annie's face goes blank.
6) 254) dialog: Annie! Great job tonight..
6) 256) dialog: No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets...are you ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Vegas.
6) 258) dialog: Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and--
6) 260) dialog: Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.
6) 268) dialog: Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.
6) 306) dialog: Ooh, Occasionz. I'm impressed.
6) 342) dialog: Listen, I know the--
6) 351) dialog: Whitney?
6) 353) dialog: Whit, it's Helen.
6) 355) dialog: Hiiii!
6) 357) dialog: Hi! Listen, I'm out here with a whole bunch of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation- appointment wasn't made. Is there any way to fit us in?
6) 375) dialog: Ok ladies, start your (french) engines! Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks. Fighting for the same dress, shirts coming off, dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting, etc.
7) 25) dialog: Hi Annie! INT. ANNIE'S DRESSING ROOM. Helen has flung open Annie's dressing room curtain, putting an abrupt end to her fantasy. She is wearing cream colored lingerie, showing off her TOTALLY amazing body. Annie is uncomfortable.
7) 26) dialog: Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh, is that the dress you like?
7) 28) dialog: A sash? Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts.
7) 43) dialog: Everyone! We can't all have the dress that we want. I've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, âIf invited, would I wear this a dress to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!â
7) 45) dialog: With that in mind, I say we wear this one. Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it.
7) 47) dialog: Only if they're nominated for the Sound of Music.
7) 54) dialog: Well, I think Lillian would like THIS one. Lillian walks in.
7) 57) dialog: I love it. Right guys? The girls all agree. Except Annie.
7) 59) dialog: I think it might look best in cream.
7) 78) dialog: Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an STD? Everyone freezes.
7) 91) dialog: Well, I don't have it.
7) 94) dialog: Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding?
7) 107) dialog: I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.
7) 111) dialog: (sotto) Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today.
11) 91) dialog: Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were late. Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.
11) 94) dialog: And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
11) 96) dialog: Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something. That would be fun. Where are the diamonds?
11) 98) dialog: Oh! And Annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette.
11) 105) dialog: Can't wait. INT. ANNIE'S APT. THAT NIGHT. Annie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on the couch watching the same Home Improvement show.
11) 126) dialog: Hi.
11) 128) dialog: Hiiiii.
11) 135) dialog: I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World?
11) 137) dialog: But a bachelorette at Sea World?
11) 139) dialog: Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie's other line rings.
11) 153) dialog: When?
11) 189) dialog: Oh but it's gonna be so much fun! Besides money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's our friend.
11) 202) dialog: Vegas it is.
12) 7) dialog: Lillian, look what's happening.
12) 14) dialog: I got a limo from the hotel. We're in Vegas! Yaaaay!! They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking.
12) 19) dialog: Come on Lillian, you're staying with me in the master suite. It's all set.
18) 11) dialog: Ok you guys, change of plans. The Velour Cobra had an opening at 9 so I got us a dinner reservation. Isn't that radical?
18) 36) dialog: Annie, don't tell Lillian, it's a surprise.
18) 43) dialog: My friend Sean Michael works for a promotional company and they're having this big event tonight at Tara Rei's stepbrother's Club, Sacrifice.
18) 45) dialog: I think it should be our first stop. H's reserving seats for us in the VIP section. It's a $150 cover and there's a one bottle champagne minimum of $750 per table, he said people from the Real World go in there all the time.
18) 47) dialog: We are. After that.
18) 49) dialog: Oh, well we're only gonna be there for an hour or so, you can just meet up with us after.
18) 51) dialog: I'll just text you when we're getting ready to leave. I hope you feel better. Lillian comes up already a little tipsy.
18) 59) dialog: Don't tell Perry I bought them,I ordered them from New York. They're insanely expensive. But I gotta tell you guys the compliments I get on my ass make them worth every penny. She sticks her butt out. Lillian slaps it and all the girls laugh. She is the life of the party.
20) 5) dialog: What?!!
20) 7) dialog: She's meeting us later!!!
20) 16) dialog: Annie HAS DIARRHEA!!
20) 18) dialog: She's fine! She's gonna meet us in an hour, it's all set! (to the other girls]
22) 22) dialog: I'm just saying, we're gonna be late. I don't wanna be rude.
22) 24) dialog: Excuse me Annie.
22) 39) dialog: You're not going to run into her. Just shut-up about it.
22) 76) dialog: Ew, he's like 65. Ok, look Lillian that's you.
22) 78) dialog: Ew, at that beach, that weird beach!
22) 80) dialog: She was crazy. Annie sinks. A flight attendant appears.
23) 1) dialog: Annie? Where are you? Inside a truck?
23) 3) dialog: Annie, the shower needs to happen soon. We haven't heard from you and everyone is-
23) 5) dialog: Annie can I dialog openly with you? I know you're having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I did the shower. Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and I think what's important here is what's best for Lillian.
23) 7) dialog: You don't have to give me an answer now
23) 10) dialog: Great. Well, I'll definitely need some help.
23) 12) dialog: Could you bring the cookies? Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles. Pissed.
25) 0) text: Annie drives to Helen's. She sees a pink and white highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit sign) âLillian's Shower Rue. This exitâ
25) 33) dialog: Hi Annie!
25) 35) dialog: Oh, it's nothing....so...Just make yourself at home. Enjoy!
25) 37) dialog: What did you say?
25) 44) dialog: OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop dance with the GUESTS!
25) 67) dialog: Hello ladies. Bonjour. (french sentence)Yay! Welcome. I am your host Helen, a bridesmaid in Lillian's wedding. I want you all to have a wonderful time. Eat, drink, please have some cookie! She laughs and then becomes very serious.
25) 68) dialog: Lillian. Today's your day. I'd like to make a beautiful toast, âYou are pretty, fun, sweet, look at all of your friends. Girlpower!â Everyone enjoy your lunch, served along with the musical stylings of...The LILLIANETTE'S!!! A quartet, all in pink and white and harmonize. âLillia Lillian, Lillian, Lillian! When Lillian was a little girl...â Judy claps and enjoys the music. She leans over to Annie.
25) 90) dialog: #9. What is Lillian's favorite ice cream flavor? Write it down...quickly.
25) 92) dialog: OK, last one. For the big prize. #10. What is the craziest place Lillian and Dougie....? Helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of saying, â...had sex?â Shower Girls Ooooh and Ahhhh.
25) 107) dialog: This one's from me. Helen hands Lillian her gift. Lil opens it and holds up beautiful lingerie.
25) 127) dialog: Why don't we go in the other room and--
25) 129) dialog: Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really don't know what you mean.
25) 151) dialog: Do you think she still has body lice?
30) 0) text: Annie pulls over. She puts the piece of paper in the small paper bag. She gets out of the car, leaving it running. A few seconds later she comes back without the bag. Takes a deep breath and drives away. INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. 2 HOURS LATER.
30) 2) dialog: The park? Don't be stupid Dana.
30) 9) dialog: Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying.
30) 12) dialog: Why would she go to the reservoir? Its just a big tank of water.
30) 18) dialog: Is that supposed to be a dig on my driving?
30) 20) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't take a stunt driving course in Renegade missions.
30) 28) dialog: I was being funny!
30) 30) dialog: Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless.
30) 33) dialog: Was it a person?
30) 36) dialog: Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.
30) 47) dialog: Probably?!
30) 64) dialog: Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.
30) 71) dialog: Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night.
30) 78) dialog: Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen.
30) 81) dialog: What!?
30) 84) dialog: What are you talking about? The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister. Weirdo.
30) 86) dialog: Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
30) 130) dialog: Annie get in!
30) 148) dialog: Her car's not here.
30) 159) dialog: Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you.. I don't have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there. And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I....I've never been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because... I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else. And I'm just good at throwing parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that.
30) 161) dialog: I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.
30) 168) dialog: Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
30) 170) dialog: I deserved it.
30) 172) dialog: Well, I'm really rich. They smile.
30) 189) dialog: Really?!
