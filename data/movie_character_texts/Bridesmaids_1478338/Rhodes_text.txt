8) 16) dialog: Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff?

[ALT: I'm a cop] Annie smiles.
30) 238) dialog: Yes I did.
30) 240) dialog: Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
30) 247) dialog: You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something. Tupperware would've worked but then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm gonna kiss you right now so... He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about to kiss. Rhodes stops.
30) 248) dialog: I didn't want to miss my chance again.
