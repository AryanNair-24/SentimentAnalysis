20) 4) text: to see DIANA KIMBLE, leaning back after having just shut off. Sexy, in her early 40's, Diana is a waitress here in "Joey B's Diner".  Many people might be disturbed by the notion that Jason Voorhees is still alive, but for Diana...this means something much more.
20) 6) dialog: Hey!  Lady Di!
20) 7) text: Diana whirls around to see JOEY B. -- the frightening, no bullshit owner of the diner.  She's a big woman with a bi attitude.
20) 9) dialog: I'm sorry to cut into your TV time, but there's a few customers out here who'd like to eat sometime this fuckin' month.
21) 1) text: "Joey B's Diner" may not be the last place in the world y want to eat, but it's at least the second to last.  A cou of hockey masks hang from the ceiling and a banner procla "JASON IS DEAD -- 2 FOR 1 BURGER SALE!" hangs on the far
21) 7) text: That comes from VICKI, the other waitress in the diner. Early 20's, she's cute and she's tough.  She moves off as Joey B. steps up.
21) 9) dialog: No, this is not sick, Diana, this is business.  People are gonna come to see Jason's hometown and they're gonna come with appetites.
21) 10) text: SHELBY, Joey B.'s husband and cook, leans out the serving window.
21) 14) text: Besides him, WARD, Shelby and Joey B.'s early 20's son, sticks his head out as well.
21) 19) dialog: Yes I do!
21) 23) dialog: Well, that's your dumbass fault -- they're supposed to look like hockey masks!  Now watch.
21) 24) text: Joey B. quickly cuts a fresh hamburger patty into the appropriate shape, then balls up the cut-away meat and ho it up in front of Ward.
21) 26) dialog: This makes a whole new patty...hence the 2 for 1 burger sale.
21) 218) text: One of Joey B's hockey mask spins slowly in her field of vision, but instead of looking cheesy...it now seems scary...foreboding.  Diana turns back to Steven.
25) 34) dialog: Why don't you shut the fuck up and cook those burgers?!
