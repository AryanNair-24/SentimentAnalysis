9) 29) dialog: OK. I have a vestigial tail.
9) 31) dialog: It's more of a nub, really. The spine  just goes on a little longer than it  should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean,  perform fellatio once and you're a  poet, twice and you're a homosexual.  I remember once I was being fisted  by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where  the story gets interesting. He was  lactose-intolerant. He could eat red  meat all night long, but one sip of  milk and it was gastric hell. And I  remember we were caught in fragrance  delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you  can imagine my humiliation at having  Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no  teeth." One of my greatest  disappointments is that I never became  a song and dance man. I could have  been a quadruple threat, kind of  like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer,  singer, actor, and I would possess  nuclear weapons, the latter being  the most threatening of the four. I  once sat on a bus and tried to will  myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended  up with was a sense of failure and a  mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth  and perhaps a grudging respect for  the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage.  For the most part I distrust dogs. I  slept in a horse once. It was quite  roomy. On second thought, it was the  Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss'  and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I  wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the  Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I  also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy  of The Fonze while I was in coma  after smoking some Peruvian prayer  hash, but who at the end of the day  can honestly say they haven't done  that?

12) 19) dialog: Of course you do.
12) 20) text: Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on hi control panel, but Number Two interrupts.
12) 22) dialog: I have so few pleasures left to me,  Number Two. The key to life is to  rotate your vices. One day it's  executions, another day it's creamy  French cheese.  It's like frickin'  heroin.
12) 24) dialog: Cool.

12) 37) text: Dr. Evil gloats. So does Mini-Me.
12) 39) dialog: What, that already happened?
12) 41) dialog: This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well,  how about a frickin' time machine?  Does the president have a time  machine? Have I been scooped on that?
12) 43) dialog: Alright, time machine it is. As you  know, every diabolical scheme I've  hatched has been thwarted by Austin  Powers. And why is that, ladies and  gentlemen?
12) 45) text: Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott  Evil" button on Dr. Evil's control panel. Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle. Mini-Me glares at S and GIVES HIM THE FINGER.

12) 62) dialog: No, Scott, Daddy has a score to  settle. Austin Powers is the snake  to my mongoose, or the mongoose to  my snake. Either way it's bad, I  don't know animals. But I do know  this: This time it's personal. Frau,  Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969.  Come, Mini-Me.
12) 63) text: Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating perfectly. They enter the portal. There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like i Star Trek.

13) 6) dialog: Mini-Me?

42) 33) dialog: What did you call me?
42) 35) dialog: (unsure) Bless you? Anyways, since my "death  star" laser was invented by the noted  Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I  thought we'd name it in his honor--  the Alan Parsons Project.
42) 37) dialog: What now?
42) 39) dialog: (indicating laser) When you get your own evil empire,  you can call it whatever you want.   Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate  the awesome lethality of the Alan  Parsons Project. Fire the laser!
42) 42) dialog: Actually, that was just footage from  the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture  Independence Day, but it would be a  lot like that. What do you think,  Scott?
