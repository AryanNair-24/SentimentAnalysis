16) 2) text: Austin hits a button on the dashboard. BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash
16) 3) dialog: (on picture phone) Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of  British Intelligence.
16) 5) dialog: We'll send a man around immediately.  How was your honeymoon?
16) 7) dialog: Ah women, who can understand them?  Moving on, let's discuss your new  case.
16) 9) dialog: You'll be doing a photo shoot. We  know that one of the models is an ex- KGB agent selling top secret material  to the highest bidder.
21) 1) dialog: Where is he? In here?
22) 1) dialog: Austin, I came as soon as I heard.
22) 4) dialog: What's wrong with your neck, Austin?
22) 6) dialog: We're going to run a few tests,  Austin. Don't worry, old friend,  we'll get to the bottom of this.
24) 5) dialog: Alright, everyone, we're done.
24) 7) dialog: Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin.  Not only were you actually reading  an article in that Playboy, but a  candy-stripe nurse offering to give  you a sponge bath didn't so much as  turn your head.
24) 9) dialog: I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's  true: you've lost your mojo.
24) 12) dialog: I'm afraid that's not possible,  Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has  returned.
24) 14) dialog: Again.
25) 1) dialog: We have evidence that Dr. Evil has  developed a time machine.
25) 3) dialog: Our researcher noticed that these  photos from the archives have changed.  That means Dr. Evil is traveling  back in time and creating alliances  with each decade's most despised  villains.
25) 8) dialog: Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is  in the year 1969. Luckily, we also  have a time travel device. After  years of research we've developed a  machine that will transport you back  to the Sixties.
25) 11) dialog: That's what they'd like you to  believe.
25) 13) dialog: (to camera) I suggest you don't worry about those  things and just enjoy yourself.
25) 16) dialog: Good luck, Austin.
51) 47) dialog: Hello, Austin. What's wrong with  your voice?
51) 49) dialog: (Interrupting) Austin! Things are heating up, so I  thought it best to contact you in  disguise. Felicity, your plan worked.  You and Austin track Fat Bastard  back to Dr. Evil.
51) 52) dialog: Yes, and we're starting to pick up  the signal now.
51) 59) dialog: Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity,  we now know that-
51) 61) dialog: Anyway, you two follow the signal  back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and  then-
51) 63) dialog: Never mind, Austin, you two have  work to do. You must find Dr.  Evil.
78) 1) dialog: Austin, you have achieved lunar orbit.  How was that lift-off?
79) 2) dialog: Happens all the time in that  situation.
79) 5) dialog: Prepare for moon landing. We only  have one hour until Dr. Evil fires  the laser!
86) 1) dialog: Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the  moon. We'll soon know whether he has  succeeded or whether the world will  be destroyed!
97) 1) dialog: He did it, he saved the world! (calming down) Of course, I thought he might.
105) 1) dialog: Peters!
105) 3) dialog: Any word from Austin?
105) 5) dialog: (on microphone) Austin, if you can hear me, use the  time portal! There's no time to get  to the lunar module! Use the time  portal!
