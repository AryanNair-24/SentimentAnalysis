31) 3) dialog: Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.
31) 7) dialog: Do I know you? I think I know you.
31) 10) dialog: Long time, brother.
31) 14) dialog: Thank you, brother. (off Brazilian fighter) You see this beast? Marco Santos? I'm training him for Sparta.
31) 18) dialog: Come on back.
32) 3) dialog: You look good, brother. How're the girls?
32) 7) dialog: I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called.
32) 11) dialog: No, Brendan. I'm sorry. 34.
32) 17) dialog: It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good?
32) 22) dialog: I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need?
32) 27) dialog: Train you for what?
32) 32) dialog: You're serious?
32) 36) dialog: Ah, you won an event. (off bruised face) That's what this is. Let me guess, it was in a parking lot. DJ from the local radio station. Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. Am I right?
32) 42) dialog: Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But why would I train you? When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me. You never listened to anyone. These guys are animals. I mean, you're a teacher, right? What're you gonna do? You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early?
32) 46) dialog: Tess know about this? (off Brendan's nod) Yeah? `Cause the last time you fought, I got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?
32) 51) dialog: She's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?
32) 55) dialog: What do I say? What am I gonna say to you? No? I mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco. You come down, I'll throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem. But I can't promise you much more than that, Brendan. 36.
32) 63) dialog: Let me know when you're coming down.
32) 68) dialog: Now?
55) 6) dialog: No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son.
59) 5) dialog: Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow.
59) 11) dialog: You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
59) 18) dialog: That's what I'm afraid of.
59) 23) dialog: You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us?
59) 27) dialog: Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
59) 33) dialog: I'll make a call.
63) 7) dialog: Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me.
78) 6) dialog: You can do this.
78) 9) dialog: I want to hear you say it.
78) 13) dialog: Then let's go do this.
81) 8) dialog: You asked for it.
81) 20) dialog: Have some fun, baby.
86) 3) dialog: Get out of there! Get out of there!
86) 16) dialog: Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him!
101) 3) dialog: Take him down!
124) 9) dialog: You've got a visitor. Second row, 10 o'clock.
124) 12) dialog: You alright with that?
124) 20) dialog: I want you to look right at him when he comes in here. Don't take your eyes off him.
124) 23) dialog: I'm proud of you brother. This is your cage.
126) 26) dialog: Sit down. Breathe. (grabbing Brendan's face) Look at me! Look at me! Why are we here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight? You tell me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw in the towel right now. We'll get Tess and we will go home. You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home.
128) 24) dialog: Crank it! Crank it!
143) 4) dialog: One more time.
149) 6) dialog: C'mon, Josh!
149) 10) dialog: Sit down. Look at me. Look at me, Brendan! Let it go! Breathe.
149) 14) dialog: Beethoven. He's coming hard, just like we planned. I want you to angle out, hit, and move.
149) 18) dialog: Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your brother, right? He's just a guy who's in the way.
149) 21) dialog: I'm taking a little more time for the cheap shot! Do your job, Josh!
153) 3) dialog: Switch! Switch!
156) 6) dialog: Relax, breathe.
156) 10) dialog: You popped his shoulder? Good. I want you to pop his other shoulder.
156) 17) dialog: Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You got two rounds left! You need both rounds! Go in there, kick him in the head, take him down, and finish him!
159) 3) dialog: Finish him! You finish him!
