4) 8) dialog: I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old man. 2.
4) 12) dialog: She looks good.
4) 16) dialog: Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of priorities.
4) 19) dialog: Got a little something for ya. Mom always said never go anywhere empty handed.
4) 23) dialog: What? You change brands?
5) 3) dialog: I like what you've done with the place. 3.
5) 9) dialog: There's not much of a woman's touch around here.
5) 13) dialog: Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays.
5) 18) dialog: Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him?
5) 22) dialog: C'mon, just one drink.
5) 52) dialog: So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew?
5) 55) dialog: So, you gonna ask about her, or you just gonna sit there all sober?
5) 59) dialog: Oh, you know? What do you know? Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you? When we hit the water we drove north, too.
5) 64) dialog: (taking a swig) Is that one of the 12 steps? Or does a guy like you get 24?
5) 68) dialog: Did your guy tell you what you needed to know?
5) 72) dialog: That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details.
5) 77) dialog: You could've heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat. Having me rub her down with holy water, because she didn't have no insurance. All the while waiting for your pal Jesus to save her. Did your man tell you that?
5) 81) dialog: It's good to know you're sorry, Pop. Goes a long way.
5) 84) dialog: I think I liked you better when you were a drunk.
9) 19) dialog: Fitzy still own this?
9) 28) dialog: How's it work here?
9) 32) dialog: Sure.
11) 12) dialog: Yo, I'll fight him.
11) 27) dialog: 
11) 33) dialog: Yeah.
11) 43) dialog: Tommy.
11) 47) dialog: Sure, no problem.
11) 61) dialog: You owe me two hundred bucks.
21) 6) dialog: Yeah.
21) 11) dialog: Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you.
21) 15) dialog: We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did. 23.
21) 19) dialog: Alright. Look. There's this tournament. A big tournament. Top sixteen middleweights in the world. Single elimination. Winner take all for a lot of money. I'm gonna do that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm gonna need a trainer. Now that much you were good at. (off Paddy grinning) No, no, no. This doesn't mean anything.
21) 22) dialog: I'm serious. We train. That's it. I don't wanna hear a word about anything but training, you understand? You wanna tell your war stories, you can take `em down to the VFW. You can take `em to a meeting, or church, or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays.
21) 26) dialog: What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know.
21) 30) dialog: Excuse me?
21) 38) dialog: 
26) 18) dialog: Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You can take that thing back to where you found it. And you can leave the coffee in the pot. I can pour that myself. I can wake myself up, too.
37) 7) dialog: Pilar. It's Tommy.
37) 11) dialog: Good good. How you doin'?
37) 16) dialog: How're things? Kids are good?
37) 20) dialog: How's little man? 43.
37) 25) dialog: You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute what I promised you. What I promised Manny. I've got an opportunity coming up to help you guys out. To take care of you guys.
65) 37) dialog: I'm takin' a walk.
66) 7) dialog: It's going.
66) 11) dialog: I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
66) 15) dialog: I'm good right here. 56.
66) 21) dialog: You were briefed. You had the information. You chose the old man and the girl.
66) 29) dialog: Don't know `em.
66) 33) dialog: Why am I looking at pictures of people I don't know?
66) 37) dialog: And who are you exactly?
66) 41) dialog: You were in the Corps?
66) 46) dialog: I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
66) 50) dialog: Then you ain't no brother to me. My brother was in the Corps.
66) 55) dialog: I don't know what you know. Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it?
66) 62) dialog: Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness.
66) 70) dialog: 
66) 75) dialog: I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some stones.
66) 79) dialog: You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me.
66) 82) dialog: Hey, I'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, Brendan. See, you leave, you get the opposite. You leave, you get to bury people.
66) 86) dialog: You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit.
66) 90) dialog: Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?
114) 9) dialog: How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown?
114) 14) dialog: What'd I do? I took off.
114) 23) dialog: That is none of your business.
114) 27) dialog: Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.
114) 31) dialog: You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you.
114) 34) dialog: Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. At least you had some balls then. Not like now. Tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out. Take it somewhere else, old man.
114) 37) dialog: In fact, you know what? Here's a cup. Why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes?
114) 41) dialog: Go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about. Go on, get outta here.
156) 22) dialog: Shut up! C'mon.
