6) 10) dialog: Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess.
6) 19) dialog: It's her birthday.
8) 5) dialog: I'm on it.
8) 10) dialog: Where's the rest of that skirt?
8) 14) dialog: Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay? 8.
8) 19) dialog: I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action.
8) 24) dialog: Promises, promises.
10) 3) dialog: Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs--
10) 7) dialog: Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead.
10) 10) dialog: There we go. Alright Tito, well done. Remind not to mess with you. Sit down everybody. Dial it down.
10) 14) dialog: So, have we got it?
10) 19) dialog: Alright. The third law--
10) 25) dialog: 
10) 29) dialog: For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class...
10) 32) dialog: ...and tell her posse outside to beat it...
10) 35) dialog: ...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance.
10) 40) dialog: Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week.
12) 5) dialog: Brendan. 15.
12) 10) dialog: I teach Physics.
12) 14) dialog: You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure--
12) 18) dialog: Because you advised us to do that.
12) 23) dialog: We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file?
12) 28) dialog: Heart.
12) 34) dialog: So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me?
12) 38) dialog: 90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest?
12) 42) dialog: That's not how I do things.
19) 11) dialog: I'm not bouncing at a club.
19) 18) dialog: I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing.
19) 21) dialog: They're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out
19) 29) dialog: We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going
23) 12) dialog: Take your seats.
23) 15) dialog: Now, please.
24) 3) dialog: C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.
24) 7) dialog: I need the money, Joe.
24) 18) dialog: Actually, I used to be one of those animals.
24) 21) dialog: I fought for a living.
24) 27) dialog: Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--
24) 31) dialog: It was the parking lot of a strip club.
24) 39) dialog: What are we gonna do?
25) 5) dialog: 
25) 11) dialog: How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney?
25) 16) dialog: That was nice. 29.
25) 21) dialog: Next semester?
25) 24) dialog: Look, Tess. They have these smoker fights all over. There's one in Lancaster next week. There's two in Dover the week after. Wilmington. Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us afloat.
25) 28) dialog: Some of them pay a little more than that.
25) 32) dialog: And these guys, they're not real fighters. They're just guys who have seen too much UFC on TV. If you have a better solution, I'm all ears.
25) 37) dialog: It'll be fine. I'll just leave the house as usual, except now I'll be going to the gym.
31) 12) dialog: Liking the place, Frank.
31) 16) dialog: Amazing, man.
32) 5) dialog: Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie.
32) 9) dialog: It's alright.
32) 14) dialog: It's all good. She's good now.
32) 19) dialog: Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually.
32) 24) dialog: I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.
32) 29) dialog: I want to get back in the cage.
32) 34) dialog: I just won an event the other night.
32) 40) dialog: Ish.
32) 44) dialog: I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue. The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. I need to keep working the smokers.
32) 48) dialog: No. I was unconscious.
32) 53) dialog: It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank?
32) 58) dialog: That's all I need.
32) 61) dialog: I appreciate it.
32) 65) dialog: 
33) 6) dialog: What're you doing here?
33) 10) dialog: Something wrong with your hands?
33) 13) dialog: If there's nothing wrong with your hands then there's no reason for you not to phone. That's the deal. 37.
33) 18) dialog: Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.
33) 23) dialog: I'm going inside.
33) 27) dialog: Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything.
33) 32) dialog: You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do.
33) 36) dialog: You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is. 38.
33) 41) dialog: Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that?
33) 44) dialog: That shit you pulled. Never again. And all the shit I saw growing up? That doesn't happen here.
33) 47) dialog: Take care of yourself.
33) 55) dialog: Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
33) 59) dialog: He came to see you?
33) 64) dialog: You and Tommy are training together? 39.
33) 68) dialog: Tommy Conlon.
33) 72) dialog: I know what her name is.
33) 76) dialog: I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days?
33) 81) dialog: Did he say if he wants to see me?
33) 85) dialog: Wow, look at you. Mister inside man.
33) 88) dialog: You and Tommy training together like nothing ever happened. This is unbelievable. Now I know what you're really doing here.
33) 92) dialog: You came to gloat.
33) 97) dialog: Well, there you go. You got your son back.
33) 101) dialog: You got your son back.
33) 104) dialog: You know, part of the reason I stuck around was `cause I thought I'd finally get you all to myself. But you didn't have any interest in training me. Tommy was the one.
33) 108) dialog: Forget it. You were always a front runner. You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son.
33) 112) dialog: Am I?
33) 116) dialog: Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I do not trust you. Tell Tommy this is where I am if he wants to see me.
33) 121) dialog: Goodnight, Pop. 41.
33) 130) dialog: Just some nice old man.
59) 3) dialog: You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?
59) 8) dialog: Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me?
59) 13) dialog: It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do.
59) 16) dialog: They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage.
59) 20) dialog: Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you. 49.
59) 25) dialog: That's not gonna happen.
59) 29) dialog: 
59) 36) dialog: I love my coach!
60) 10) dialog: I'm in. I'm going.
60) 18) dialog: It's a lot of money, Tess.
60) 22) dialog: You don't think I can do it.
60) 26) dialog: I'm not gonna get killed.
60) 33) dialog: Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise?
60) 36) dialog: So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd really love it if you'd be with me on this.
66) 5) dialog: Been looking all over for you. How's it going?
66) 9) dialog: I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee.
66) 13) dialog: You don't want to go sit down somewhere?
66) 19) dialog: Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to know I was never gonna see you guys again?
66) 23) dialog: She wasn't some girl. I married her. She's my wife.
66) 26) dialog: (handing Tommy the picture) That's Tess. And that's Emily and Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.
66) 31) dialog: I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them.
66) 35) dialog: Because that's my family.
66) 39) dialog: I'm your brother, man.
66) 43) dialog: What? 57.
66) 48) dialog: I wasn't in the Corps.
66) 53) dialog: Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old kid. What the hell did I know?
66) 57) dialog: She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again? Not a single phone call? Nothing?
66) 60) dialog: God, man, I don't understand this. You won't forgive me, but you'll forgive Pop?
66) 64) dialog: That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them.
66) 67) dialog: But I forgave Pop. Just like I forgave you and Mom. 58.
66) 73) dialog: Yeah.
66) 77) dialog: I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do?
66) 84) dialog: You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make!
78) 11) dialog: I can do this.
108) 5) dialog: I'd doing this!
108) 9) dialog: I'm doing it!
136) 7) dialog: I'm gonna fight him.
146) 6) dialog: Where's Pop?
149) 16) dialog: Angle out, hit, and move.
153) 11) dialog: Tap, Tommy!
153) 14) dialog: Tap!
156) 4) dialog: I popped his shoulder.
156) 8) dialog: I heard it tear.
156) 13) dialog: Josh! 100.
156) 20) dialog: Tommy! What are you doing?
156) 24) dialog: What are you that crazy?
156) 29) dialog: What are you doing? It's over!
156) 32) dialog: It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't have to do this.
163) 4) dialog: I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry!
163) 7) dialog: Tap, Tommy! Tap!
163) 10) dialog: I love you, Tommy! I love you!
