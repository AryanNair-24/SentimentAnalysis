28) 6) text: I need to make an appearance at Midnite's. Say ten-ish? Chaz sighs, starts out -- JOHN
33) 6) text: Midnite! Come on, do I have to huff and puff here?! The doors unlatch.
34) 1) dialog: Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes... John steps in through the doors behind.
34) 3) dialog: You're back early.
34) 8) dialog: But I'm sure you spent enough.
34) 10) dialog: Tell me you found it.
34) 12) dialog: That's not what I asked.
34) 15) dialog: Second century depiction of a sephiroth in the 4th realm...
34) 17) dialog: It should counter the iconic plane --
34) 22) dialog: Must I remind you of what selling fake relics will do to your health?
34) 26) dialog: Why did you cut your trip short? John stops the counting, actually thinks about it.
34) 35) dialog: 
61) 0) text: John paces as Midnite works on that Universal orrery, adjusting components but balance continues to elude him.
61) 8) dialog: What do you want from me?   A shoulder to cry on?
61) 10) dialog: They don't like you, John. You've deported how many back to Hell?
61) 12) dialog: Right.
61) 14) dialog: You must have just crossed over and didn't even realize it --
61) 16) dialog: -- it's wet out, you're wandering around aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional --
61) 21) dialog: Okay, so you saw something. We've seen a few small ones slip through now and then.
61) 23) dialog: John, you know my connections. Any shifts or tremors in the planes and I'd hear about it. John just shakes his head, looks up -- convinced.
108) 0) text: Elevator opens and John steps out into a lobby of concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams money. Lots of it. Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is practically empty. Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open. John looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick DOOR glides closed, seals with another HISS. No way in. John notices the janitor down one hallway. It's Nico from Midnite's. He and John lock stares. Nico opens a "Security Only" door, steps inside -- leaves the door open.
109) 0) text: Monitors are powering up around the room. A few of those Young Businessmen we last saw at Midnite's are here.
122) 0) text: John bursts through a door -- Midnite right on his heels. MIDNITE
122) 2) text: And this time he might just make it. MIDNITE (unconvinced)
122) 4) text: And the bridge. MIDNITE
122) 6) text: You don't know her. MIDNITE
122) 8) text: Where's the chair? MIDNITE
122) 14) dialog: It's a fine line that separates a hero from a fool.
122) 16) dialog: And taint my establishment with your blood? I don't think so.
122) 18) dialog: You know what that device can do to the ill-equipped --
122) 20) dialog: -- and even in your most glorious days your brain was never your most powerful attribute --
122) 23) dialog: (holds up his finger)
123) 5) dialog: I have insurance issues. John clears off the seat, starts to sit.        Midnite b him.
123) 6) dialog: You haven't surfed in decades.
123) 8) dialog: You'll be lucky to reach an elemental plane.
123) 10) dialog: In your condition your body won't take much.
123) 12) dialog: And if you do -- what then?
124) 2) dialog: Listen to my voice inside...
125) 0) text: Midnite kneels in front of John who is now handcuffed to the chair, cables draped from every limb.
125) 1) dialog: I'll try and guide you out.
125) 3) dialog: Mammon was forced out of that girl when she jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in, he would have fallen back to Hell.
125) 5) dialog: Then watch yourself. He could be in anyone out there. John nods. Midnite lifts a palm of INSECT WINGS in front of his face.
125) 10) dialog: Peter do caelis, Deus, misere nobis. Fili Redemptor mundi, Deus, Miserere nobis... A FLASH turns into a streak behind John's face -- stretching to infinity.
125) 11) dialog: Find the possessor and the Spear will be revealed... find them... find them and follow... The flash whips back TOWARD us and John is suddenly somewhere else. He looks O.S.
126) 8) dialog: John's hands suddenly become MIDNITE'S as his ally pulls him back into --
127) 0) text: John's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of Midnite's grip. John gasps as he comes back -- nods to Midnite and finally --
129) 0) text: Midnite piles ASSAULT RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a table.
129) 1) dialog: You know these won't kill them. John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan.
129) 5) dialog: You probably won't even get close enough to use them. In the pan is that RELIGIOUS RELIC he brought from India. It's now MELTING. Midnite has trouble watching it dissolve.
129) 6) dialog: And it's not just the boy. John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small casting blocks.
129) 7) dialog: You better worry about whoever's helping him. John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings into a pot of water -- HISSSSSS.
129) 8) dialog: As much as I admire your blind faith even in the most dire situations -- expecting to just waltz into a facility that is about to become the floodgate of Hell is reaching a bit, even for you. John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just knows what he's thinking. Midnite sighs, heavily.
129) 9) dialog: Well I suppose two fools can die just as easily as one. John almost smiles.
129) 10) dialog: Hey, you think I'm trusting you to save the world? John taps the casting and out falls a GOLD-TIPPED BULLET.
129) 11) dialog: But we're going to need more than a few magic bullets to get inside. John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around the room. Just like John's. Hmmmm...
130) 1) dialog: (sighs)
132) 0) text: Front glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly strut inside. Stop. HEAR the O.S. MURMURS of an unseen crowd. This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people. Lawyers. Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc... Most are crowded in front of a set of double doors. Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys. John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot cop.
132) 26) dialog: Let's go. John drops Ellie to the floor. No more pretty face -- no face at all -- yet the screams still come. John and Midnite get to the doors -- shove through.
134) 0) text: Holy rain has stopped in here. A fine mist floats in the air. John and Midnite make their way through. Only their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence. Another set of doors is ahead. Before they reach it a faint shadow crosses in the mist. Both pause, expecting something to reveal itself. But it doesn't.
136) 0) text: John and Midnite burst into the room, spot Barry standing in the tank. His hands in the water. On Angela. JOHN (rushing toward him)
136) 9) dialog: (to John)
136) 12) text: John coughs, struggles to stand. He tries to cover but it's obvious his end is nearing. Midnite positions Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides -- crucifixion-style. She tries but can't break free. John puts a hand to her forehead --
136) 14) dialog: Rescind from the flesh I command thee -- Amar natash bow basar! Angela's body stops fighting. The darkness in her eyes and fingernails begins to fade. It's working... Midnite is suddenly JERKED backwards with an agonizing YELL. Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness. John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is lifted right off the floor by an INVISIBLE GRASP, slammed into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible force against the floor. Midnite glares at John, tries to speak.     But the words die on his lips.
