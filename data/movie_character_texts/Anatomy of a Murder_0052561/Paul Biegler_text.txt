30) 358) dialog: Your honor, how can the jury accurately estimate the testimony being given here unless they first know the reason behind this whole trial -- why Lieutenant Manion shot Quill? The prosecution would like to separate the motive from the act.

30) 419) dialog: Ionly asked if he gave a test. I didn't ask the results,
30) 422) dialog: Now after all this investigation, did you believe Mrs. Manion?
30) 424) dialog: Even after the lie-detector test?
30) 431) dialog: (a half-grin) Thank you, Your Honor. But in any case, Sergeant Durgo, you yourself in your heart and mind were quite convinced of Mrs. Manion's honesty.
30) 454) dialog: No questions,
30) 464) dialog: Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?
30) 468) dialog: How much more didn't you tell me?
30) 470) dialog: Is that right, Laura? (CONTINUED)
30) 475) dialog: Well, the fat's in the fire now. Get this -- both of you. When you get on the stand I want you to tell the truth. Don't tell anything but the truth. Don't try to lie, don't try to conceal or you'll be skinned alive. Dancer's going to start moving in.
30) 490) dialog: Doctor, in making your test, did you notice any bruises or marks on Mrs. Manion at that time?
30) 492) dialog: Were you asked to determine the reason for these bruises?
30) 494) dialog: Where did you do the laboratory work on the test for sperm?
30) 496) dialog: Who worked the slides up for you?
30) 498) dialog: What kind of a technician?
30) 500) dialog: Was he a pathologist or an expert in laboratory work having to do with human reproduction?
30) 502) dialog: Woulda't it have been better to have these'slides worked up by a pathologist or an expert in this field?
30) 507) dialog: Wouldn't it have been especially better to wait for an expert if the possible question of rape hung on the result?
30) 509) dialog: Now, Doctor, in the newspaper on the evening of August sixteen it was stated that you had found no evidence of rape. Is that true?
30) 511) dialog: Did you form an opinion about whether Mrs, Manion had been raped?
30) 513) dialog: Why didn't you form an‘ opinion?
30) 515) dialog: No further questions.
30) 523) dialog: One more question, Doctor, That no evidence was present in her body does not mean she wasn't raped, does it?
30) 525) dialog: Do you know what constitutes rape under the law?
30) 527) dialog: No more questions,
30) 544) dialog: We'll be glad to show the Court Mrs. Manion's hair, Mrs, Manion, will you take off your hat, please? Laura jerks her hat off, pulls a couple of hairpins and d shakes out her glamorous tresses,
30) 553) dialog: Your Honor, defense will concede that Mrs, Manion when dressed informally is an astonishingly beautiful woman, As a matter of fact, it's pretty easy to understand why her husband became temporarily ‘deranged when he saw such beauty bruised and torn by a beast, Judge Weaver blows his nose to keep from laughing.
30) 582) dialog: Objection, That calls for an assumption on the part of the witness, your honor,
30) 588) dialog: (rising) Mr. Paquette, the attorney for the People asked you if Mrs, Manion was tight and you said she was high. } Speaking as a bartender, what is 5 the distinction between the two?
30) 590) dialog: When we say a person is tight we ' usually mean they're a little stupid with drink, isn't that right?
30) 593) dialog: - So in other words, Mrs, Manion was happy. Now is there anything wrong with being happy in the Thunder Bay Inn? e PAQUETTE No. (CONTINUED)
30) 597) dialog: Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it? Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing.
30) 599) dialog: Is it unusual to see a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?-
30) 601) dialog: So Mrs, Manion taking off her shoes in Thunder Bay doesn't necessarily mean that she was being unladylike, does it?
30) 603) dialog: Yes or no,
30) 605) dialog: You testified that Mrs, Manion was squealing, jumping up and down and swishing her hips at the pinball machine. Was she creating a disturbance, was she attracting a crowd?
30) 607) dialog: Were all of the men in the bar standing around watching Mrs. Manion?
30) 609) dialog: But you were conscious of Mrs, Manion, enough so that you can tell us how she acted, . (CONTINUED)
30) 614) dialog: And certainly Barney Quill was conscious ‘of Mrs, Manion, because he was playing pinball with her, Wouldn't you say so?
30) 616) dialog: So it seerns that only you and Barney Quill were acutely aware of Mrs, Manion and her actions and appearance, Perhaps Barney, when he came to get some drinks, perhaps he winked and said, ‘Alphonse, I'm going to take this babe out and rape her. ' oa
30) 618) dialog: {boring in =~ raising his voice) And maybe you said, 'Do it once for me. The courtroom is rumbling,

33) 62) dialog: Now just ~ hear me out, please. I believe that Barney told Al Paquette what happened that night and sent Al to the window here to watch out for Manion - while he stood by by one of his gun racks - waiting. Manion came in and fired almost the moment he entered the door and that first shot went right through Barney's heart, All I want is for you to try and persuade Al to come into court as a defense witness and tell the court what Barney told him - that he had raped and assaulted Mrs, Manion,
33) 64) dialog: Everybody loves something or someone, Me, I love fishing and an old guy named Parnell, Manion loves his freedom ~ he'd like more of it, Barney loved you -= and maybe so does Al, I wouldn't blame him, He doesn't want youto | know the truth about Barney... that he '..gould'be'brutal'and dangerous, But if you ask Al <= straight out ~- She stares at Paul for a long time -- then calls:

34) 13) dialog: Your honor, I have no other direct questions at this time, But since I'm sure the credulity of the Court has been strained about the part the little dog played on this night, I should like a few minutes to show the Court this remarkable little animal,

34) 46) dialog: Your honor, if counsel wants to know the grounds for Mrs. Manion's divorce -- let him ask that question,
34) 52) dialog: (quickly) May I refresh the witness's memory for Mr. Dancer?
34) 82) dialog: Your honor, may the record show that counsel has deliberately cut off my view of the witness.
34) 84) dialog: (angrily) I further object to the implication that I'm signaling the witness. This is the shabbiest courtroom trick I've ever seen.
34) 91) dialog: You do it once again and I'll punt you all the way out into the middle of Lake Superior.
34) 112) dialog: Objection, your honor. ‘ The witness answered the question about other 1 men. Counsel is now making a veiled suggestion for the jury.
34) 138) dialog: Objection, The use of the word ‘prowl! is intended to mislead the jury.
34) 149) dialog: Your honor, how can the witness answer straight off if the counsel interrupts her answer?!
34) 154) dialog: Your honor...
34) 192) dialog: Your honor, I object to this line of questioning. It's immaterial what Mrs. Manion does all the time, On the night she was attacked she was wearing panties. That's all we're concerned with,

35) 2) dialog: What is that opinion?
35) 4) dialog: At the time of the shooting do you believe that he was able to distinguish right from wrong?
35) 11) dialog: Now doctor, as clearly as you can, will you explain Frederick Manion's temporary insanity? SMITH. It is known as dissociative reaction, A psychic shock which creates an almost overwhelming tension which the person in shock must alleviate. In Lieutenant Manion's case, a soldier, it is natural that he would turn to action. Only direct simple action against Barney Quill would relieve this unbearable tension. This is not too uncommon, For example in combat -- in war I mean -- some of the more remarkable heroics take place in this state of mind. Soldiers who have performed fantastically brave acts are frequently unable to recall having performed those acts because they were at the time in the grip of dissociative reaction,
35) 12) dialog: Is there another name for dissociative reaction, one we are more likely to recognize?
35) 14) dialog: Now doctor, a man in the. grip of irresistible impulse.-- would he be likely to go to a neighbor for advice, would he call the police to come to his aid?
35) 16) dialog: But our man was able to think of taking out a gun and loading it before he set off to find Barney Quill, (MORE)
35) 22) text: PAUL (cont'd) He testified that he got the gun because he was afraid Quill would shoot him, If he was in a trance~like state, how do you explain this?
35) 24) dialog: Would this tension interfere with his physical ability? -- say his ability to accurately fire a gun?
35) 26) dialog: How would a man look when in the grip of dissociative reaction? SMITH . He might appear to be deadly calm -- fiercely deliberate.
35) 27) dialog: Gould you describe his behavior as being like a mailman delivering the mail? .
35) 29) dialog: Would a man in this state be apt to converse with other men?
35) 34) dialog: QO Do you mean that if someone stopped him and spoke to him he might answer but he wouldn't be likely to speak first?
35) 36) dialog: Your witness. Dancer rises. During his first few questions Paul is surv the courtroom -- then bends to Maida and whispers -~
35) 37) dialog: Can you spot Mary Pilant?
35) 74) dialog: Glad to oblige, your honor.
35) 83) dialog: Change it to what?

35) 101) dialog: Keep it and try it sometime. (CONTINUED)
35) 130) dialog: Iobject, Your Honor. Is the Doctor stating a proved fact or an opinion? We are not dealing here with chicken pox or a sore throat but with the mysteries of the human mind. If the Doctor is giving his opinion it should be qualified as such.
35) 135) dialog: No, it doesn't. Your Honor...
35) 139) dialog: (sitting) All right.
35) 152) dialog: Dr. Harcourt, psychiatry is an effort to probe into the dark undiscovered world of the mind -- and in there the world might well be round or it could be square -- your opinion could be wrong and Dr. Smith's opinion could be right, isn't that true?
35) 154) dialog: And good Doctor that you are, you very carefully used the word believe, didn't you? :
35) 157) dialog: But isn't it possible it might have caused you to change this opinion?
35) 164) dialog: Doctor, did you ask to make an examination of the defendant?
35) 166) dialog: Did the attorneys for the people petition for such an examination in your behalf?
35) 168) dialog: So your opinion boils down to a snap judgment, doesn't it?
35) 170) dialog: Dr. Smith's opinion was made under better circumstances, wasn't it?
35) 172) dialog: Thank you, Doctor.
35) 184) dialog: Your Honor, we would like to hear the witness's answer. Counsel cut him off.
35) 186) dialog: (grinning) But I think the Doctor was about to qualify that yes.
35) 196) dialog: {to Manion) What can he tell?
35) 227) dialog: Mr. Miller, what are you in jail for?
35) 239) dialog: I apologize for my client, Your Honor. Yet, his outburst is almost excusable since the prosecution has seen fit to put a felon on the stand to testify against an officer in the United States Army.
35) 244) dialog: Your honor, I would like to see this man's criminal record,
35) 247) dialog: Mr. Miller, this record shows you've been in prison six times in three different states. You've been in three times for arson, twice for assault with a deadly weapon, once for larceny. It also shows you've done short stretches in four city jails for the charges of indecent exposure, window peeping, perjury, and committing a public nuisance. Is this your true record?
35) 249) dialog: Mr, Miller, how did-you.get the ear of the prosecution in order to tell them about your conversation with Lieutenant Manion?
35) 251) dialog: Taking who to his office?
35) 253) dialog: He took you all at once or one at a time?
35) 260) dialog: Were you promised a lighter sentence if you would go on the witness stand?
35) 264) dialog: Perhaps you just thought it might help your own troubles if you dreamed up a story that would please the D. A. ?
35) 266) dialog: And you're sure that's what Lieutenant Manion said? ©

35) 286) dialog: What did you talk about?
35) 288) dialog: That is all I wanted to know. (CONTINUED)
35) 302) dialog: The defendant is not qualified to answer that.
35) 312) dialog: _. (desperately) There has been nothing established to permit a question like that. He keeps trying to insinuate without ever coming to the point, Let him ask the Lieutenant, did he ever beat his wife.
35) 315) dialog: I'll ask it. Did you, Lieutenant Manion, ever beat your wife on the night of the shooting or any other time?
35) 317) dialog: Is there any doubt in your mind that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?
35) 319) dialog: That's all. .
