Her eyes narrow suddenly -- she hasn't got her lenses in and her gaze is  myopic -- as she notices something odd. There is a bit of black something, a thread, in the corne of Tudor's mouth. Janine moves closer to it. The black th like the tip of an insect's leg, twitches. Janine reaches out to brush the thing off Tudor's lip. As her fingers brush by, the leg twitches back inside Tudor' mouth. Janine jerks back in horror, her hands, balled into fists cover her own mouth as though to protect it from whatever occupies Tudor's mouth. Gradually the thread reappears. Tudor's lips part slightl to allow the emergence of the dark, viscous tentacle to w the thread -- a hook used to hang on inside the body -- i attached. The tentacle of the blood parasite probes its w from between Tudor's lips. Janine is paralyzed with horror. The tentacle is now touching Tudor's chin, his cheek, the tip of his nose. Janine's fists tighten even more. A glassy snap breaks th silence. Janine lowers her hands dumbly and opens them. I the right one, the one that held the contact lenses, are  incised two bloody circles where her fingers pressed the  lenses into her flesh until they snapped. The segmented l fragments glint in the tiny pools of blood. She tries to control the hysteria welling up inside her. eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the f stubby tentacle is joined by another and another. She mov a fraction of an inch at a time, almost hypnotized by the movement of the tentacles. The hooks of the tentacles are now set into Tudor's chin cheeks, and the tentacles draw taut as something attempts draw itself out of his body. His throat bulges, his cheek swell as the tentacles contract. His lips are gradually f apart as the quivering, moist shape emerges. His mouth is opened to jaw-breaking width as the creature slowly expos itself to the dim light of the bedroom. Janine's eyes are wide with terror. She utters a gurgling cry and runs, stumbling, from the bedroom. She dashes thr the living room and reaches the door to the hallway,  whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the  doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open.
