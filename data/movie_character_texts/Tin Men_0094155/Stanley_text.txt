He kneels down and talks to the driver of the car. There seems to be a serious exchange but with the sound of TRAFFIC and the cars passing THROUGH FRAME, we're un- able to hear what is taking place. Stanley nods, taps the side of the car, car drives off. Stanley goes back to his car and drives off.

105) 21) dialog: How come Moe's so good?   Why do you think, huh?
