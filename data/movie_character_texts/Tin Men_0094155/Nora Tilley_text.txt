130) 47) dialog: My benefit! You don't give a damn about me! You don't give a damn who I marry. The reason you don't want me to marry is because he's the one taking your wife, and you've got your own problems with him.
130) 52) dialog: You don't care about me... it's the same bullshit you're doing. That's what it always is with you, Tilley. It's always you! The I.R.S. took your house... your furniture! You don't say anything about my things in the house. I've got things in the house I worked damn hard for, and things that belonged to my family... the headboard that was given to me by Aunt Josephine, it's got to be at least a hundred years old... and the hand-embroidered footstool...

133) 0) text: BB and Nora are in bed together.
133) 1) dialog: Maybe if I    talked to him another day he'll    change his mind. I mean, he's    like that... one day, he's this    way and another day he's that way.
133) 3) dialog: I mean, he's probably, you know, upset about the I.R.S. taking the house and all our stuff. After a beat.
133) 8) dialog: What?
133) 10) dialog: What does that mean?

143) 25) dialog: Get the toast yourself. BB takes the toast out of the toaster.
143) 28) dialog: Why don't you take both... maybe you can choke to death on one of them. BB takes one of the plates and goes toward the table. Nora watches him a beat, amazed that he doesn't seem to recognize the seriousness of the situation.
143) 32) dialog: (angry)
143) 35) dialog: I can't believe you had to shoot pool! Don't you understand that ... don't you understand how crazy that is? You're sitting there... you're eating your eggs as if it's normal business in life here! Like feudal lords or something you used to read about in history books.
143) 37) dialog: What happened?
143) 39) dialog: You lost?
143) 41) dialog: You lost?
143) 46) dialog: What does that mean?
143) 48) dialog: Will you stop eating the eggs for a minute! How can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs?! What does this mean, Bill?
