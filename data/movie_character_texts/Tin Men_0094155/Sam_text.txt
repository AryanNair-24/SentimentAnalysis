15) 0) text: Seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast. SAM PICKLES, a heavyset man in his 50's, delicately butters his toast, and is shaking his head sadly.
15) 1) dialog: Did ya see 'Bonanza' last night? Can you tell me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over?
15) 7) dialog: No... he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.' It doesn't make any sense... he invites a strange colored guy in... invited him in to stay. Is that crazy or what? If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can I stay the night,' I'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'! It's nothing personal, mind you.
15) 9) dialog: Me?   No, I'm not a bigot.
15) 11) dialog: It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's on the Ponderosa... he's in the middle of nowhere. It's not like he's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around... we're talking about the West here. It's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West. It doesn't make sense, that's all I'm saying.
15) 16) dialog: Listen, I'll sell tin to anybody ... I don't care who he is. A mark's a mark, whether he's Chinese, Indian or from Mars... I'm thoroughly integrated. Makes no difference to me... I just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house.
17) 3) dialog: I just don't believe that 'Bonanza' is an accurate description of the West. I say no more. Tilley slips into the booth next to Sam.    He indicates for Sam to give him more room.
17) 5) dialog: You want me to take my plate... I'll eat in the parking lot.
17) 10) dialog: (biting into his toast)
17) 26) dialog: Gil, he doesn't know the guy.
17) 28) dialog: He seems to be indicating that he doesn't know him.
17) 33) dialog: You're not a girl and you're impressed! Florence comes over and puts down some coffee in front of Tilley.
30) 0) text: Tilley is packing up his sample case. A middle-aged HUSBAND and wife sit on a couch across from him.
31) 0) text: Sam is singing to the RADIO. Tilley opens the back door and throws his sample case inside. He gets in the driver's seat and slams the car door angrily.
31) 2) dialog: The amount of time you spent there, I thought you were ready to send for me to close it up.
32) 18) dialog: He's always said that about you, Wing. Always said that about you... he has.
32) 30) dialog: And some scotch, straight up. Tilley pockets the check.
32) 32) dialog: (to Mouse)
32) 36) dialog: They have no respect for the working man.
32) 39) dialog: Jesus! What a pain in the ass. Do you think this commission's gonna stick around or is it gone with the wind?
35) 0) text: Tilley, Sam, Mouse and Gil are about to leave the hotel. They're putting their coats on just inside the closed door. Tilley is halfway into his coat.
35) 8) dialog: What's he got, a gnat up his ass? What the hell's wrong with the guy?
44) 0) text: Sam is going through some papers on a desk, and comes across an IRS letter addressed to Tilley. He notices that it hasn't been opened. He looks at the postdate mark -- it's five weeks old, dated January 3, 1963.
44) 1) dialog: Jesus Christ! We can hear the "BANANA BOAT SONG" through the door, with MOUSE SCREECHING along with it. Sam takes the letter and goes through the door to the pool hall.
45) 1) dialog: Tilley. He nods for Tilley to go over to him. They start to walk together through the darkened areas of the Pool Hall.
45) 2) dialog: Found this on your desk while I was going over some papers. He hands the letter to Tilley.
45) 4) dialog: Maybe it's a refund check. Tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document.
45) 6) dialog: What? It must be a clerical error.
45) 8) dialog: What are you talking about?   You didn't pay your taxes?
45) 16) dialog: You can't mess around with the government. Why don't you go to H &amp; R Block, they'll take care of your taxes for you.
45) 18) dialog: Taxes is serious stuff, Tilley.
45) 20) dialog: All I can say, is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this, 'cos the IRS, they don't fuck around.
51) 0) text: As the door closes behind Tilley, he goes to where Sam's car is parked and gets in the passenger seat.
51) 1) dialog: So, what's the scoop?
51) 3) dialog: You're kidding?
51) 5) dialog: Are you fucking crazy? You just gave them forty-two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free?!
51) 12) dialog: What are you talking about?
52) 0) dialog: 
52) 1) dialog: Mr. Tilley is crazy... he had a nervous breakdown. WIDEN to include Man and Wife from before.
52) 3) dialog: He's been under a lot of pressure recently... he snapped... he had a nervous breakdown... it's the saddest thing I've ever seen. Let's be honest about it, nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding free.
52) 8) dialog: Let me tell you something, when I go and see his boss and show him this contract, he's out of this business... he'll lose his home ... his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street. He'll probably spend some time in an institution, so God knows what will happen to his wife and kids. Anyway, it's not your problem.
52) 10) dialog: You don't expect his boss to pick up the forty-two hundred job, do ya?
52) 12) dialog: Yeah, it's a bad state of affairs. (beat)
52) 15) dialog: You don't think there's some way you could work with me to try and resolve this, do you?
52) 17) dialog: Let's look at it this way, what if I can sell you this job at a wholesale price... kind of lessens the burden. The big boss won't get so angry, and maybe won't throw the guy's wife and kids out... at least they'll have a roof over their heads.
52) 22) dialog: You got a cup of coffee?
52) 24) dialog: Let's just sit down and kick this around. The Wife goes into the kitchen.
52) 25) dialog: (calling to Wife)
52) 26) text: No hurry, ma'am. The Man turns to sit down, and as he does so, Sam throws a $5 bill on the ground.
52) 27) dialog: What you doing throwing your money around? He bends to pick up the $5 note.
52) 29) dialog: I found a five-dollar bill, here by the side of the chair.
54) 0) text: Sam is driving and Tilley is rubbing his hands together with excitement.
54) 2) dialog: Gil says that's where 'Marengay' hangs out.
55) 21) dialog: Yeah.
55) 25) dialog: What do you expect, it's half price night for divorced women. The place is hopping.
55) 36) dialog: I'm beginning to believe in God.
55) 38) dialog: No, I'm not saying that, but I'm beginning to give God more thought.
55) 40) dialog: I tell ya... I took my wife for lunch yesterday... we went and had some smorgasbord, and it kind of happened.
55) 42) dialog: Yeah.
55) 44) dialog: Maybe... but I had mine in a smorgasbord.
55) 49) text: Sam, you're too much.
55) 50) dialog: I went to get myself a salad and I started to see all these vegetables, you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it's time to get to the main course you won't eat too much... that scam to get you filled up so you don't eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff.
55) 52) dialog: So I see celery, I see the lettuce, tomatoes, cauliflower... and I think, all these things come out of the ground... they just grow out of the ground. They had corn -- out of the ground... radish -- out of the ground. You say to yourself, how can all these things come out of the ground? You know what I'm talking about? All these things are out of the ground.
55) 55) dialog: I mean, how can that be? It just happened that way? And I'm not even getting into the fruits... I'm just dealing with vegetables right now. With all those things coming out of the earth, there must be a God.
55) 57) text: I'm not getting the same religious effect that came over you. I don't know why, but I don't feel like running to a church to pray right this second.
55) 61) dialog: You gotta admit, it's amazing.
69) 0) text: Tilley is driving.    The same Sinatra record "IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE   MORNING" is playing on the car RADIO Tilley does his now   familiar neck exercises to relieve tension. He's hard    to read... a mixture of happiness and sadness.
74) 9) dialog: What about 'Super Highway' in the seventh... it's paying 7 to 1. Ran well in its last race. Gil looking at the newspaper.
74) 12) dialog: Who's that?
74) 17) dialog: (looking at Tilley)
79) 1) text: Sitting at a table. Sam is studying the racing form, Tilley is studying the menu.
79) 6) dialog: (to Tilley)
79) 13) dialog: (to Tilley)
79) 23) dialog: Six. (to Waiter)
79) 28) dialog: Mr. Motor.
79) 30) dialog: Tilley, this is insane. You're picking horses because you think you're clairvoyant or something.
79) 32) dialog: Hallihan's Daughter.
79) 40) dialog: You're not exactly talking about a long shot. Mr. Motor, for instance, is coming off at 50 to 1. Tilley taps his forehead, with his eyes closed.
79) 44) dialog: Thrifty's Delight -- number four -- 20 bucks.
79) 46) dialog: Twenty to one.
79) 48) dialog: What are you, crazy?   What happens if he wins?
81) 14) text: I got close once up in the Catskills. I met this  girl, Dorian. For a week we  were together, but it wasn't the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff. She didn't  have things in my room. BB gives a big sigh.
89) 6) text: I've got myself a winner. Tilley turns to look at Wing. Sam turns towards Tilley looking concerned. We see the totals flashed on the board indicating that the winning horse pays $16.30.
91) 16) text: Fordnee lane -- eight hundred. Sam is looking at Tilley knowing that he's really in a jam.
91) 19) text: Waiter, can you get me a cup of coffee? Tilley looks over to Sam, with panic on his face.    Wing turns back to Tilley and Sam.
91) 36) text: Sam, what is he talking about?
91) 37) dialog: (quietly)
91) 58) dialog: I don't know the whole story.
92) 0) text: Tilley and Sam are leaving the racetrack and walking to Tilley's Cadillac.
92) 1) dialog: Why didn't you at least give him the six hundred that you pocketed from the six races he lost?
92) 3) dialog: Yeah.
92) 23) text: That guy would never let me win. He must be setting me up. The son of a bitch is setting me up, Sam.
92) 24) dialog: For crying out loud, why don't you just leave it at that... you win.
92) 26) text: I smell a rat. BB's car pulls away.    Tilley and Sam watch him go.
100) 0) text: Tilley, Sam, Mouse and Gil are sitting in a booth having just finished breakfast.
100) 1) dialog: Let me see what the damage is. (he reaches for the bill, hums as he reads)
100) 3) dialog: Mouse, figure it out, will ya?
100) 9) dialog: Well, sometimes you'll eat more than he does, and it'll even out.
100) 15) text: Sam, what did he have?
100) 16) dialog: Let me get out my notebook. How the fuck do I know what he had?
100) 30) dialog: We don't remember, I don't know why.
100) 35) dialog: French toast. There's a KNOCK at the window of the diner.
104) 15) dialog: He comes out of the back room into the pool hall, and walks over to the table where Tilley and Gil are playing pool. He drops an open envelope onto the pool table.
104) 16) dialog: (to Tilley)
104) 19) dialog: Home Improvement Commission. With those words there's a genuine moment of concern from all of the tin men -- even Mouse stops singing. Tilley picks up the envelope and pulls out the letter.
104) 21) dialog: I think that's the gist of what they're saying. Gil looks over Tilley's shoulder at the letter.    Mouse comes over.
104) 27) dialog: It's certified.
104) 29) dialog: I dunno... I don't know what they've got.
106) 0) text: Sam's Cadillac moving along a row of houses.
107) 0) text: Sam is driving the car, Tilley is in the passenger seat, very drunk.
107) 5) dialog: They've got nothing concrete against us, because if it's just hearsay stuff, it's neither here nor there.
107) 7) dialog: It's better I drop you off.
117) 0) text: Tilley and Sam exit the building. Seconds later BB and Bagel come out of the police station. Both pair of men head for their respective Cadillacs. BB has egg stains all over his suit.

120) 4) dialog: See how quickly you can clear it up?
120) 33) text: Sam, this guy gets on my nerves... from day one! I knew it then and I know it now. Tilley stands up from the table and starts to leave.
120) 45) dialog: (to Tilley)
120) 46) text: Come on, let's get out of here. Sam ushers Tilley to the door.
122) 0) text: Sam is driving and Tilley is in the passenger seat.
122) 1) dialog: You know, when I saw 'Bonanza' the other day, something occurred to me. There's those three guys living on the Ponderosa and you never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid. You never hear Hoss turn to Little Joe and say 'I had such a hard-on when I woke up this morning.' You know ... they never talk about broads ... nothing. Ya never hear Little Joe say 'Hey, Hoss, I went into Virginia City and saw a girl with the greatest ass I ever saw in my life.' Ya just see 'em walking around the Ponderosa saying, 'Yes, Pa,' and 'Where's Little Joe?' Nothing about broads. I don't think I'm being too picky... at least once if they talked about getting horny. I don't care if you're living on the Ponderosa or right here in Baltimore, guys talk about getting laid. (beat)
122) 10) dialog: Yeah, we'll go and have some lunch at the smorgasbord.
123) 0) text: Tilley and Sam are in line at the buffet. Sam fills up his tray and moves off to the cashier. Tilley hangs behind staring at all the food. He looks up to the ceiling.
125) 0) text: The Home Improvement Commission is in session. Tilley and Sam sit at the defense table. Masters presides over the commission table where four or five other commis- sioners sit.
125) 6) text: Sam, does it ring a bell to you?
125) 7) dialog: (leans into microphone)
125) 15) dialog: (leans into the microphone)
125) 28) dialog: (leaning into the microphone)
125) 46) dialog: (leaning into microphone)
125) 54) text: Excuse us for one moment. He then leans over to Delaney, and they start to confer. Tilley and Sam watch, wondering what's going on. Masters leans in the other direction, holding his hand over the microphone, and he talks to the other commissioners. They nod in approval, then Masters leans back into the microphone.
125) 57) text: Glad we could be of some service. Tilley and Sam get up from the table and walk out of the building.
126) 0) text: Tilley and Sam are walking toward Tilley's car.
126) 2) text: We beat 'em, Sam... we beat 'em! What a piece of cake! No problem! They ain't got nothing on us... clean as a whistle... we're clean as a whistle!
126) 3) dialog: I need a drink. I hate inquisitions.
128) 0) text: Tilley and Sam are sitting at the bar  nursing a couple of drinks. In the b.g., the pianist   is playing "Last Night When We Were Young," and a few  people are sitting around the piano joining in with the  song.
128) 1) dialog: Ya know, Tilley, we been working together for over a year.
128) 3) dialog: I've been thinking that sometimes a different combination makes for better luck. Ya know what I mean? I mean, maybe the two of us ain't the right combination.
128) 5) dialog: Let's face it, we're not exactly setting the world on fire.
128) 7) dialog: Maybe it's a slump, but like baseball, some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again.
128) 9) dialog: Yeah.
128) 11) dialog: I know you're gonna... I know you're gonna.
128) 16) dialog: Look, we beat the   Commission today ... you know, we   got a little bit of a victory.  We   split right now and maybe we can   add to that... you know what I'm   saying?
128) 19) dialog: Well, I had a    conversation with Solly Shavitz,    so... maybe I'll go with him. (beat)
128) 22) text: Here's to some pretty good times, huh? Sam smiles.
135) 0) text: The pool hall  is fairly unlit, except for the slight shaft of light  falling over several tables. Gil is play- ing pool with  another tin man. Mouse, Sam, and three or four other tin  men are playing pool.
148) 0) text: Same as before, except now we see Stanley enter and sit amongst the observers.
150) 9) text: Thank you. BB gets up and walks to the back of the  room. He stops at the same desk as Tilley, but instead  of going into his wallet like Tilley, he just reaches  into his suit pocket, pulls out a license document and  tosses it onto the table. Then he heads out the door.
