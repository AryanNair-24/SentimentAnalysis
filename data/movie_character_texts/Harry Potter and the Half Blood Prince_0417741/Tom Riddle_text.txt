35) 0) text: The Castle is dark, but for one WINDOW. INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 45 Dumbledore sits alone at his desk, the deep lines of his face illuminated by the shimmering PENSIEVE. TWO OBJECTS of note are before him. One is a BLACK-STONED RING. The other is TOM RIDDLE’S DIARY. (CONTINUED )
36) 13) dialog: Don’t. Dumbledore stops, turns. Finds Riddle’s level gaze on him.
36) 15) dialog: You're the doctor, aren’t you?
36) 17) dialog: I don’t believe you. I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff. They want me looked at. They think I’m different.
36) 21) dialog: I’m not mad.
36) 25) dialog: Yes.
36) 27) dialog: (watching the spider) I can make things move -- without touching them. I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me. I can make them hurt... if I want. Dumbledore studies Riddle -- then the boy looks up.
36) 28) dialog: Who are you?
36) 30) dialog: Prove it. It is not a request. Without breaking his gaze, Dumbledore’s eyes narrow ever-so-slightly and... the WARDROBE BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Riddle wheels. (CONTINUED )
36) 39) dialog: (looking off) I like having things that belonged to other people. It makes me feel +++ close to them. Dumbledore studies Riddle’s profile, pondering this.
36) 41) dialog: I can speak to snakes too. Dumbledore stops and we are ON his face, his back to Riddle. (CONTINUED )
36) 44) dialog: They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal. For someone like me?
65) 17) dialog: Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at Riddle.
65) 21) dialog: Intuition. Riddle smiles but his expression suggests intuition had nothing to do with it. Slughorn chuckles uneasily.
65) 24) dialog: I know a secret shortcut or two.
65) 26) dialog: Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they’re not like you. They might... misunderstand.
65) 28) dialog: I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me... Suddenly, a DENSE FOG engulfs the room and SLUGHORN’S VOICE twists into an ANGRY SHRIEK: (CONTINUED )
86) 59) dialog: Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at Riddle.
86) 61) dialog: Intuition.
86) 66) dialog: I know a secret shortcut or two.
86) 68) dialog: Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other Professors, well, they’re not like you. They might... misunderstand.
86) 70) dialog: I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me. It’s called, as I understand it... a Horcrux. Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether.
86) 72) dialog: Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully understand it.
86) 74) dialog: Yes, sir. Which is why I came to you. I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you. Slughorn frowns, clearly disturbed, then speaks quietly. (CONTINUED )
86) 78) dialog: Yes, I thought it might be something like that. But I don’t understand how that works, sir.
86) 80) dialog: Protected?
86) 82) dialog: How does one split his soul, sir?
86) 84) dialog: Murder.
86) 86) dialog: Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once? For instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number --
86) 91) dialog: Of course, sir. And I promise I’1ll not speak of our conversation. It’1ll be our little secret... Riddle reaches out then and pinches the FLAME of a candle, killing it. As SMOKE RISES, we --
