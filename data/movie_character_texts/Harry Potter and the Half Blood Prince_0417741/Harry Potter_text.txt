The SILHOUETTE. The HEADLINE: “HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?” But the (unseen) reader is fixated on a SMALLER ITEM, tucked at the bottom corner of the back page: “Malfoy Sentenced to Azkaban.” TWO PHOTOGRAPHS accompany the piece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of Narcissa and DRACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom. Draco’s eyes look distant, haunted.

As Harry enters, the ACCORDION doors to the NEXT CAR SQUALL open and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS emerge. He watches them when a VOICE causes him to turn back. As the accordion doors slowly close, he spies Malfoy sitting with PANSY PARKINSON and a BOY with the cheekbones of a sphinx (BLAISE ZABINI). Harry studies Malfoy when a BOY pushes through the accordion doors. As they begin to close, slowly, Harry reaches into his pocket and removes the ORANGE AND BLACK LUMP Fred gave him in Diagon Alley. He eyes Malfoy, eyes the closing door and -- impulsively -- pitches the lump into the air. It soars through the narrowing crease of the doors and -- just as Malfoy glances his way -- just as it reaches the apex of its flight -- POOF! -- explodes softly, raining DARK POWDER.

Deciding, he dips the goblet into the dark water. Instantly, the lake begins to CHURN. Harry backs away, the goblet sloshing in his hand. FACES, pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling water. Harry tips the water into Dumbledore’s mouth. Dumbledore blinks. His tongue probes his lower lip. Harry returns to the water’s edge, hesitates, then plunges the goblet into water once more. Instantly, a SLIMY WHITE HAND snags his wrist and Harry is pulled under. The goblet bobs on the surface. (CONTINUED )

100) 6) dialog: All right. Okay. Harry gently disengages from Dumbledore, leaves him leaning against the ramparts. He dashes to the stairwell door and, glancing back, sees Dumbledore MUTTERING WEARILY as he GESTICULATES with his blackened hand.

HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 134B. EXT. HAGRID’S HUT/GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 1321 Quiet here. A VIEW TOWARD the castle. We HOLD. Slowly FIGURES appear on the horizon. The Death Eaters. Greyback. Bellatrix, Draco. And Snape.
108) 0) text: Harry bursts through the entrance doors, wand in hand. Before him, the grounds shimmer eerily in the GREEN GLOW. He sees the FIGURES FLEEING towards Hagrid’s Hut. EXT. HAGRID’S HUT / GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 134 Snape and the others race toward the edge of the grounds. Suddenly, Snape pulls up, looks back. Sees Harry sprinting toward him. Malfoy, looking edgy, is watching Harry too.

108) 5) dialog: Running. Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in his eyes. Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and black against the raging fire. Harry points his wand, fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesn’t move, merely lets it streak by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving, and takes aim again.
108) 6) dialog: Cruciatus! Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.
108) 7) dialog: Incacerata! Once again, Snape deflects the spell.

108) 17) dialog: Hagrid... HAGRID! Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR flies off its hinges. Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beard SMOKING.
108) 18) dialog: Hagrid! You alright?
108) 20) dialog: Hagrid, Dumbledore --
109) 0) text: Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn and watch the throng of students part for Harry and Hagrid. Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry pushes on, kneels. Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth. Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered cheek. Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly. Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks on. Understands all. McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING FIRE. The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once more. The Dark Mark vanishes.

DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - DAY 139 Quiet. Still. Empty. Then: The door eases OPEN and Harry enters. For a moment, he simply stands staring. Taking inventory. Spying something, he crosses to the great desk opposite. Looks down. Dumbledore’s wand. Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and bearing the impression of its owner’s fingers, it is a strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb lightly over the wood, transfixed, when... .«.. McGonagall enters. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Potter. He doesn’t respond, lost in the wand. McGonagall’s eyes drift to it, briefly, then study Harry’s face. She frowns, trying to call forth some words. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Potter, in light of what’s happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone... She falters. Harry gently sets the wand back upon the desk, retraces his steps to the door, pauses for one last look. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL You should know... Professor Dumbledore... Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words necessary. At a loss, she finishes quietly: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL You meant a great deal to him. Harry’s eyes rise. High upon the wall, the past Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as he sleeps. Dumbledore. Harry nods, lingering one last moment, and exits.

115) 0) text: Harry starts down the stairs, stops. Hermione, Ron and Ginny sit talking quietly. Ginny looks up. Smiles softly.
116) 0) text: Harry and Hermione stand by the ramparts while Ron and Ginny stand further along, just out of earshot. Harry stares into the distance at the ashes of Hagrid’s Hut. Hermione toys with the locket before them.
116) 2) dialog: No. He was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. And I did nothing... Hermione studies Harry, takes the locket from the rampart.
116) 4) dialog: Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not. It’s a fake. As Hermione reacts, Harry nods.

116) 10) dialog: Dunno. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. Which means, it was a waste. All of it. Hermione studies Harry’s troubled face, then Ginny and Ron.
116) 12) dialog: I’m not coming back, Hermione. Hermione nods.
116) 14) dialog: I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I’m not sure where that will lead me... but I’1l1 let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can. (ALT: I have to finish what Dumbledore started. And... I have to do it alone.)

116) 24) dialog: Funny, he says the same about you.
116) 26) dialog: You're brilliant. You both are. Harry looks off again and Hermione follows his gaze. She looks out over the grounds. Slowly losing herself. We can tell. She’s taking inventory. Pressing it into a scrapbook.
116) 32) text: HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 141.
116) 34) dialog: I don’t know. Hermione nods and Harry’s eyes shift, consider Ron and Ginny. As if sensing his gaze, Ron turns and they exchange a look, something unspoken but true passing between them. Just then a SONG rises on the air, mournful and haunting, and seconds later a BIRD soars out from beyond the tallest turret and begins to stitch its way across the sky. Ron and Ginny cross to Harry and Hermione, lean against the rampart. All look to the horizon, watching the bird grow smaller while its song -- magically -- endures. No one says a word. FADE OUT.
