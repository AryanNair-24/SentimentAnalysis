21) 0) text: LUNA LOVEGOOD moves down the aisle wearing a pair of RED and BLUE CARDBOARD GLASSES (SPECTRESPECS) identical to the ones modeled by a witch on the cover of the current issue of The Quibbler, a stack of which Luna clutches to her chest.
21) 1) dialog: There’s an article on Wrackspurts this month. Quibbler...? The loitering STUDENTS ignore her, including DEAN THOMAS, currently WHISPERING to Ginny, who smiles mildly, more interested in the PURPLE PYGMY PUFF perched on her shoulder.
21) 2) dialog: He’s lovely. They’ve been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?

30) 1) text: Luna Lovegood wanders down the aisle HUMMING, red and blue Spectrespecs wobbling on the bridge of her nose. Up ahead one compartment’s BLINDS are shut. Luna stops HUMMING. Cocks her head curiously. As she does, the LIGHT from an overhead lantern kicks off the cheap plastic lenses of her glasses and, for the briefest of seconds, a FLUTTERING CLOUD appears. (CONTINUED )
31) 0) text: Luna’s SILHOUETTE SWELLS over the blinds, then the door opens. She calmly draws her wand and sends forth a blast of RED LIGHT. The Invisibility Cloak slithers from Harry's body.

31) 3) dialog: Wrackspurts. Your head’s full of them.
32) 0) text: The castle glitters. Harry, face blood-spattered, nose slightly off-center, approaches with Luna.
32) 2) dialog: It’s alright. I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.
32) 4) dialog: That’s nice. Just then PROFESSOR FLITWICK rushes forth clutching a long roll of PARCHMENT bearing all students’ names.
32) 10) dialog: Who are those people? Harry turns, sees Luna staring into the darkness, where SHADOWS drift eerily, like ghosts.
32) 18) dialog: Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way. But it’s up to you.
32) 22) dialog: No. But I’ve done several toes and how different are they really? This does not fill Harry with confidence. Nevertheless...
32) 26) dialog: Episkey. Luna poises her wand over Harry’s nose and... gives it a TAP. It VIBRATES WILDLY and then... SNAPS into place.
32) 28) dialog: Exceptionally ordinary.
37) 17) text: The survivors press ICE PACKS to their heads, run TAPE round twisted fingers. Only Ron, hovering at the west goal, and Cormac, hovering at the east, remain on the pitch. Luna, Spectrespecs in place, eyes Cormac -- cool, confident, clear. Then eyes Ron -- sweaty, nervous, SWARMING in WRACKSPURTS.
