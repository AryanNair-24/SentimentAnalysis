15) 20) dialog: Really?
16) 4) dialog: A few days ago. Though... for a bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming. Harry looks up, sees her glance at Ron.
16) 7) dialog: She’s not alone. Even my parents -- and they’re Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
16) 10) dialog: There’s been a lot of chatter lately. That he’s gotten... old.
17) 28) dialog: These are adorable. Inside a cage, small round BALLS of FLUFF roll about, SQUEAK.
18) 0) text: The sun fades over an IRON ARCHWAY -- Welcome to Diagon Alley! -- as Harry, Ron and Hermione pass beneath. All around them, SHOPS sit silent, windows BOARDED-UP or SHATTERED. People scurry by, avoiding the SCARY FACES of the witches and wizards who peer out from the SECURITY POSTERS plastered to every LAMP POST. Bellatrix is there: “KNOWN DEATH EATER,” And Greyback: “WEREWOLF.” And LUCIUS MALFOY: “CAUGHT.”
18) 1) dialog: How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alley’s closed down.
18) 4) dialog: Oh no. Look. Harry and Ron follow her gaze to the wreck that is Ollivander’s Wand Shop.
18) 5) dialog: But everyone got their wands from Ollivander. Young. Old...

19) 17) dialog: I don’t know. Harry stares at the SMOKE drifting from the cauldron. A SOUND RISES, growing more powerful and the ROAR of a...

22) 2) dialog: Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this --
22) 5) dialog: Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
22) 10) dialog: I told you. I don’t know what I saw. (CONTINUED )

33) 2) dialog: (whacking him) Will. You. Stop. Eating! Your best friend is missing!
33) 6) dialog: (as he arrives) Where’ve you been, Harry? And what happened to your face?
33) 12) dialog: What’s happened to his hand?
34) 15) dialog: Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. And that... In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS -- one new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when a box -- marked “BEZOARS” -- tips. As Harry makes a grab for it, Ron wrests free the new textbook and goes off grinning.
34) 16) dialog: ... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world. (MORE) (CONTINUED )
34) 19) dialog: It’s rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them. For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste -- Hermione blushes, stops herself. Slughorn regards her.
34) 25) dialog: Liquid luck. A buzz runs through the class. Even Malfoy perks up. (CONTINUED)
34) 37) dialog: How did you do that?
34) 39) dialog: No. The instructions specifically say to cut.
34) 41) dialog: Sh! Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into his cauldron. It HISSES, then turns LILAC. Harry grins. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW DOLLY TOWARDS the vial of Felix Felicis and...
37) 12) text: Ginny flies swiftly, handling the Quaffle with ease. TWO SECOND YEARS collide in mid-air. Cormac makes a brilliant save. Ron makes a shaky save. Hermione looks on, nervous for him. Katie Bell snatches a Quaffle with one hand, splits two defenders beautifully and makes a slick blind pass to Dean who jets high in the air, then lets the Quaffle roll off his fingers... right into Ginny’s hands as she races below. Seamus sends a Bludger rocketing into the stands, scatters a group of onlookers, leaving only Neville, who sidles delicately to the right as the others leg it. TWO THIRD YEARS collide in mid-air. Cormac makes a brilliant save. Ron turns the wrong way but makes the save anyway as the Quaffle caroms off the tail of his broom. Hermione looks on more nervously. (CONTINUED )
38) 0) text: Harry scans his Potions book. Hermione peruses the Prophet. Ron cracks walnuts, pitching the pieces into the fire.
38) 3) dialog: He’s vile. Ron considers this, then glances across the room at Lavender.
38) 7) dialog: No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
38) 10) dialog: I’d like to know just whose book that was. Let’s take a look, shall we?
38) 12) dialog: (suspicious) Why not?
38) 14) dialog: The binding is fragile? She makes another grab for it, but Harry holds it clear. Then Ginny appears, plucks it out of his hand.
38) 16) dialog: The who?
39) 1) dialog: For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?
39) 4) dialog: Well, I was curious. So I went to --
39) 7) dialog: And... nothing. There’s no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
39) 12) dialog: What’ve you got there, Hagrid? Hagrid tips open the bag. The trio grimace. Hagrid CHUCKLES.
39) 14) dialog: Stinksap? You’re not sick, are you?
39) 19) dialog: The Aurors. I know they’re here to protect us, but... somehow I don’t feel any safer. Just then Harry spies Slughorn, heading down towards the Village, passing a weary Flitwick coming the other way. (CONTINUED )
40) 5) dialog: Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please. The kid WHISTLES and the rag leaps back into his pocket. Harry continues to eye Slughorn, when he sees Draco. They lock eyes briefly, then Draco exits.
40) 7) dialog: Oh, honestly, Ronald. They’re just holding hands... (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
40) 10) dialog: (as Dean kisses Ginny) And snogging.
40) 12) dialog: Leave? You can’t be serious.
40) 14) dialog: So? What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? Would you expect her to get up and leave? Ron blinks, utterly speechless. Then:
40) 25) dialog: Be delighted, sir.
41) 0) text: The snow falls heavily now. Ron and Harry walk together, while Hermione trails several yards behind, pirouetting happily, letting snowflakes fall on her tongue.
41) 3) dialog: What’s up? At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE AIR. Hair dancing violently in the wind, her face remains eerily placid. Then she... SCREAMS. Harry and Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles. At their touch, she FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED UP in her skull.
41) 6) dialog: I’ll get someone --
41) 57) dialog: My parents are dentists. They tend to people’s teeth.
41) 59) dialog: No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches. As Slughorn nods, the door GROANS. Everyone turns. (CONTINUED )
41) 67) dialog: Look at her eyes. They’ve been fighting again. Her and Dean. Harry nods, then stands as Ginny reaches the table -- the only one. Hermione notices, eyes him with amusement as he sits.
41) 69) dialog: Nothing. As Hermione smiles, she lightly strokes the crystal hourglass with a finger and we --
42) 6) dialog: How was what?
42) 8) dialog: Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert. (CONTINUED )
42) 11) dialog: Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know. And we’re meant to bring someone...
42) 13) dialog: Actually, I was going to ask you.
42) 15) dialog: Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
42) 26) dialog: Don’t drink that, Ron! But Ron’s frozen in mid-sip, looking at Harry’s palm too. Quickly, he gulps down the rest.
42) 27) dialog: You could be expelled for that.
44) 2) dialog: Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
44) 4) dialog: You shouldn’t have done it, Harry.
44) 6) dialog: (caught ) That was different. It was tryouts. This was an actual match -- She stops. Harry dangles the vial. The SEALING WAX is UNBROKEN, the bottle full.
44) 7) dialog: You didn’t put it in? (as he shakes his head) Ron only thought you did? He nods. She POPS him playfully on the arm when WHISTLES and CATCALLS rise. They turn to see what the commotion is about and find, smack dab in the center of the room... (CONTINUED )
46) 0) text: Hermione sits atop a desk, a small ring of TWITTERING BIRDS circling her head. The birds change color as they orbit, from sunny yellow to a dark, angry scarlet.
46) 1) dialog: Charms spell. Just practicing.
46) 3) dialog: (studying her wand) How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? (off his look) I know, Harry. You're my best friend. I see how you look at her. Just then the DOOR BURSTS WIDE and Ron rushes in, pulling a GIGGLING Lavender by the hand. They stop. Take inventory.
46) 6) dialog: Oppugno! Instantly the birds race like angry red bullets toward Ron, who flees, SLAMMING SHUT the door. (CONTINUED )
47) 0) text: THROUGH the icy window, we see Harry cradling Hermione within. As CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY, RISING THROUGH the FALLING SNOW, the VIEW EXPANDS. In the Common Room, the party rages on, while three windows down, Lavender pulls Ron into a kiss. Figures pass by windows, including one tall, pale boy standing at a WINDOW on the SEVENTH FLOOR: Malfoy. As he turns away, the castle slides FROM VIEW and the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the sky, drifting with snow.
49) 0) text: Harry trails Hermione through the stacks.
49) 1) dialog: He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. I really couldn’t care less. Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn’s Christmas party together? Yes. Of course, now, given the circumstances, I’ve had to make other arrangements. (CONTINUED )
49) 5) dialog: Yes. Why?
49) 7) dialog: (stopping) Why didn’t I think of that?
49) 9) dialog: (evasively) Um... it’s a surprise. Besides, it’s you we need to worry about. And you can’t pick just anyone. See that girl over there. That’s Romilda Vane. Rumor has it she’s trying to slip you a love potion.
49) 11) dialog: (snapping fingers) Hey! She’s only interested in you because she thinks you’re the Chosen One. You know that, right?
52) 11) dialog: 
52) 14) dialog: Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac. Under the mistletoe.
52) 16) dialog: I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he’s a menace. He’s got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
52) 18) dialog: No thank you.
52) 20) dialog: (grabbing the tray) On second thought -- maybe it‘1l keep Cormac at bay. Oh no, here he comes! (CONTINUED )
64) 7) dialog: You're lucky you weren’t killed.
65) 0) text: Hermione reads the Daily Prophet as she walks alongside Harry. The HEADLINE is GLOOMY: “MORE DISAPPEARANCES.”
65) 1) dialog: You have to realize who you are, Harry.
65) 3) dialog: So tell me what Arthur said.
65) 5) dialog: What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
65) 9) dialog: He looks different, don’t you think? Draco. Almost... ill.
65) 15) dialog: Excuse me, I have to go vomit. As Hermione exits, Harry spies Ginny, in an alcove, sitting by as Dean laughs with SEAMUS. Looking up, she sees Harry, gives a feeble wave. He waves back and we --
71) 0) text: Hermione does her homework while Harry peers at the Marauder’s Map. They are the only ones present.
71) 1) dialog: Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret? Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.
71) 3) dialog: (rising to go) You're going to have to persuade him somehow. And now, I’m afraid, you’ve made it a lot harder.
71) 6) dialog: That's... not possible. No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
73) 0) text: Harry, Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Ginny and a very somber Hermione circle Ron’s bed as MADAM POMFREY ministers to him. Slughorn sits off to the side, ina chair, looking stunned.
73) 11) dialog: I might ask you the same.
73) 13) dialog: I happen to be his... friend.
73) 15) dialog: He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I’ve always found him interesting. Hermione frowns, a bit embarrassed. Ron SNORTS, stirring.
73) 23) dialog: Oh shut up.
74) 0) text: Harry spoons soup into his mouth while perusing the Half- Blood Prince’s Potion book, his eyes lingering, as before, over the SECTUMSEMPRA SPELL: “For Enemies.” Ron absently twirls his wand as he covertly eyes Lavender. Hermione frowns over the Prophet when... a snowflake falls upon her nose.
74) 1) dialog: Ron. Stop. You’re making it snow.
74) 6) dialog: Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don’t believe it was a long conversation --
74) 8) dialog: Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that night? Not one thing?
74) 10) dialog: Right. Boggled... Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with amusement. Just then, a MILD COMMOTION draws his attention. At the back of the Hall, a group of girls surrounds a new arrival.
74) 11) dialog: That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell. Katie Bell, pale but smiling, greets the other girls. After a moment, she looks up. Finds Harry standing before her.
77) 0) text: Harry sits numbly, the Potions textbook lying limp in his hand. Hermione, Ron and Ginny sit together, a bit apart, keeping a kind of vigil. Finally, Ginny rises, steps to him.
81) 0) text: The tiny VIAL of FELIX FELICIS glimmers in Harry’s palm as he and Ron and Hermione huddle in the empty dormitory. They exchange glances, then Harry brings the vial to his lips.
81) 1) dialog: Well? How do you feel? (CONTINUED )
81) 5) dialog: Now remember. Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.
81) 7) dialog: What? No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn. We have a plan --
81) 9) dialog: No.
87) 0) text: Harry stands at a window, looking out. He brings his fingers to his chest again when... Hermione comes up behind him.

88) 0) text: Harry, Hermione and Ron walk.
88) 2) dialog: If one wants it to be. Why?
88) 5) dialog: Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!
88) 9) dialog: What if there are?
97) 0) text: Darker than usual. The fire muted. Ron and Hermione sit together. Silent. Glance toward the window, the sky beyond.
103) 0) text: As Bellatrix’s BLAST ECHOES, Ron and Hermione -- racing side by side in their regular clothes -- glance at one another, dash on.
107) 0) text: Hermione and Ron push through the other students, who are confused, crying. McGonagall appears, meets Ron and Hermione’s glance, continues on. 1321 133 134 HARRY POTTER...

Greyback. Bellatrix, Draco. And Snape.
109) 0) text: Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn and watch the throng of students part for Harry and Hagrid. Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry pushes on, kneels. Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth. Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered cheek. Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly. Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks on. Understands all. McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING FIRE. The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once more. The Dark Mark vanishes.
115) 0) text: Harry starts down the stairs, stops. Hermione, Ron and Ginny sit talking quietly. Ginny looks up. Smiles softly.
116) 0) text: Harry and Hermione stand by the ramparts while Ron and Ginny stand further along, just out of earshot. Harry stares into the distance at the ashes of Hagrid’s Hut. Hermione toys with the locket before them.
116) 1) dialog: Do you think he would’ve done it. Draco?
116) 3) dialog: Strange. Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort’s soul...
116) 8) dialog: ‘To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B.' (looking up)
116) 11) dialog: Ron's okay with it, you know. You and Ginny. But if I were you, when he’s around, I’d keep the snogging to a minimum. 142 piece of glances at Hermione smiles faintly, trying to cheer him, but Harry merely nods, looks away again.
116) 13) dialog: We reckoned -- Ron and me.
116) 15) dialog: I’ve always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you’re really thick. (CONTINUED )
116) 20) dialog: You don’t honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? (leaning in; a whisper ) You need us, Harry. Harry just stares at her. She cocks her head, smiling, doing her best to coax one out of him. Finally, he does, briefly.
116) 22) dialog: Like that’s going to happen. She glances at Ron, shakes her head.
116) 23) dialog: Besides, he’s barking.
116) 25) dialog: Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive.
116) 27) dialog: Do you think we'll ever... (come back?) She stops. Her eyes glisten briefly. Then she fights it back. Tough. Harry fights back his own emotion, reaches over and gives her hand a brief squeeze. Then releases her. (CONTINUED )
