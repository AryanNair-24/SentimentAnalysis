Contrary to our expectations, he looks like a harmless sort of guy -- ordinary, disheveled, and, at first sight, not particularly handsome.
31) 9) dialog: Startled by the applause. He wakes, tries to sit up, slips off his chair, and falls to the floor with a great clatter and bang of folding chairs.
31) 11) dialog: On his feet now, applauding and shouting, "Brava!" He winks and smiles at Jane.

34) 4) dialog: Looking for me?
34) 8) dialog: Standing beside her.
34) 9) dialog: I said are you looking for me. Or is this just a happy coincidence? 29.
34) 12) dialog: Just looking.
34) 14) dialog: Too bad. You haven't seen any snowy egrets out here, have you?
34) 16) dialog: Me, either. I'm trying to put a tennis court in and this woman, Felicia Gabriel, she sent me this letter, telling me I can't fill in the wetlands because the snowy egrets like to nest there.
34) 18) dialog: Well, I haven't seen any. ‘Course, I wouldn't know a snowy egret if I was pissing on one. Do you want some lunch?
34) 20) dialog: For lunch?
34) 22) dialog: Daryl Van Horne.
34) 24) dialog: You're the local sculptress. The one who makes the bubbie dolls. (CONTINUED )
34) 28) dialog: Little, yeah. But potent. Full of juice. Potent. You can feel it when you pick them up. I sent a couple down to New York. I have a friend... He turns and starts to walk away toward the house as he talks. Alex is not sure what to do. Then she decides to follow him.

35) 1) dialog: Interesting, huh?
35) 3) dialog: Fidel. That's his name. Been with me forever. I don't know where the scar comes from. Women like it. They're crazy about him.
35) 5) dialog: He has a big schlong. Huge. Well, there you are. Scale again. Size. (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
35) 9) dialog: Maybe it's a masculine thing. They say women don't care. I'm sort of in the middle myself. How about you?
35) 11) dialog: You see, women are in touch with different things. That's my opinion. I know that's not a fashionable opinion right now, but fuck it, I know what I see. I see men running around, dipping their dicks into every little thing, trying to make things happen. But it's women who have the real power, isn't it? Women are the source, the only power. Nature. Birth. Re-birth. Cliche, cliche. Sure. But true.
35) 13) dialog: Because you're an honest woman. And I'm being honest with you. I like women. I respect them. If you want me to talk to you like you're a dumb twit, I will. But what's the point? You have brains, Alex. More than brains. You have power. And you don't even know it, do you? Well, most women don't.
35) 15) dialog: Good question. You see? Brains. The answer is no. Don't believe in it. Good for the man. Lousy for the woman. She suffocates. She dies. I've seen it. And then the husband runs around complaining that he's fucking a dead person. And he's the one that killed her. Where's your husband? (CONTINUED )
35) 19) dialog: Well, sorry, but you're one of the lucky ones. When a woman unloads a husband -- or when a husband unloads a woman -- however it happens -- death, desertion, divorce -- the three 'd's' -- when it happens, a woman blossoms. Blooms. Like flowers. Like fruit. She is ripe. Talk about power. That's the woman for me. Would you like to see my bedroom?
36) 0) text: moving through the cavernous rooms of the house. They are sparsely furnished. Some are empty. Some have painters working. A carpenter seems to appear from nowhere and then disappear. Daryl babbles on, giving Alex a tour of his belongings. CAMERA INCLUDES every- thing he mentions, but is always MOVING, producing a DIZZY EFFECT like the effect Daryl is having on Alex. Occassionally she responds with some polite noise. But she is disconnected, as if falling under a spell.
36) 1) dialog: ... The lab is over there, past the pianos, used to be a ballroom -- nice word, ballroom -- nothing to see right now, equipment, crates ... Over there, the study, have to unpack my books, some of the old sets have to wait, need an air- control unit, and an alarm system. Not that that's any insurance policy, people are crazy, wicked, drugs, all that... What's happened to the world? That's what I'd like to know... 117 118 119 33.
37) 2) dialog: ... This is the kind of thing you should be doing. The richness, the ambiguity, the humor. No offense, honey, but you're wasting what I think is a very big talent on those little poppets of yours...

Everything is black -- walls, floor, ceiling, furnishings, curtains, carpets, sheets on the bed, even a black clock with black hands and numbers that are virtually impossible to read. As Daryl speaks, Fidel enters the room. He is carrying a black silk bathrobe. Unself-consciously, Daryl slips out of his clothing and into the robe -- with Fidel's assis- tance. Alex stands watching all this...
38) 1) dialog: ..-. The sheets are black, too. Hard to find. What they call black is really navy blue. These are black. And the lacquer work, only two people in New York do this kind of work. ‘Course, you pay with your soul, but, hell... Fidel turns down the bed and Daryl gets into it. Fidel draws the curtains against the light and then silently leaves the room, closing the door behind him. (CONTINUED )
38) 5) dialog: (continuing) ... This is my bedroom, I deserve a little luxury. You have to take care of yourself, nobody's going to do that for you. Are they?
38) 7) dialog: I'm being as direct as I know how. I thought you'd appreciate that. And anyway, I always like a little knookie after lunch. What do you say?
38) 9) dialog: No. I wouldn't dream of seducing you, Alexandra. I wouldn't insult your intelligence with anything as trivial as seduction. But I would love to fuck you.
38) 12) dialog: sits in the bed smiling.
38) 13) dialog: Do you like to be on top or on the bottom?
38) 16) dialog: Well. If that's the way you feel about it, then that's the way you feel about it. Alex stops. She turns to face him.
38) 17) dialog: (continuing) Is that the way you feel about it?
38) 19) dialog: Just your average horny little devil.
38) 21) dialog: What is it you have to go home to, Alex? There's nobody there. Is there? What'll you do? Wait for the kid to come home? Make some coffee? Do a little house cleaning? Pop a few more dolls in the oven? What's the point? The kid can take care of herself. She'll grab some food, fall asleep on her bed doing her homework. I promise. And house cleaning. Well. You clean up the dirt, there'll be some more tomorrow. (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
38) 25) dialog: Make the beds, they just have to be made again tomorrow. Wash the dishes, you'll wash them again tomorrow.
38) 27) dialog: ... Make dinner? It just gets eaten, doesn't it? You've done your best, Alex. You've done the wife bit, the motherhood bit, the garden club, the car-pools, the cocktail parties, coffee in the morning with the cleaning lady, a couple of drinks, a couple of pills, a little psychoanalysis -- where are you now?
38) 29) dialog: Pretending to be somebody else. Pretending to be half of what you are. How long can you last like that? The world keeps growing, you feed it, but it doesn't feed you anymore. Does it? It washes through you, wasted, down the drain. A woman is a hole, isn't that what they say? All the futility of the world pouring into her. How much can you take, Alex? How much before you snap? Alex is dizzy. The truth of what he's saying is hurting.
38) 31) dialog: Lying on a bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for something to happen. And knowing all the time that you were meant for something better. Feeling it. Wanting it. Having so much power. Use it, Alex. Use me. Use me. I'll be your hole. Fill me up. I want your magic. (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
38) 34) dialog: I can take it. Make it happen. No. Don't wait. Time is a killer. Make it happen. Do it, Alex. Do it now. Tears are coming involuntarily from Alex's eyes. She moves to the bed. She crawls into Daryl's arms. He cradles her.

49) 9) dialog: Doesn't bother me. I have a supernational constitution. It's genetic. And anyway what's the point? All this health consciousness shit -- pardon the language -- but what the hell, I see guys sixty, seventy years old breaking their balls trying to stay fit. What for? When I die, I want to be sick. Not healthy.
49) 11) dialog: Do I make you nervous?
49) 13) dialog: Truth is best.
49) 15) dialog: Ah. We're going to have a polite conversation.
49) 17) dialog: I don't mind. I came to Eastwick because I was drawn here. I needed a place to settle down and I liked the house. (CONTINUED )
49) 23) dialog: Garbage.
49) 25) dialog: In the house?
49) 27) dialog: Hocus pocus. Do you know that the whole witchcraft scare -- Christ, as far back as the Fourteenth Century -- it was started by the medical profession. That's right. They were trying to get the childbirth business out of the hands of the midwives. Most of the women who were burned, that's what they were. Midwives.
49) 29) dialog: Trust me. It's just another example of masculine supremacy. An effort -- successful as it turned out -- to suppress the natural power of women. And make a profit off them at the same time. Using women for their own selfish purposes. Men are cock-suckers, aren't they?
49) 31) dialog: You don't have to answer that. It's true. They're scared. Scared of impotence. (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
50) 3) dialog: It makes their dick limp when a woman has too much power. So what do they do? They call them witches. They burn them. They torture them. Until every woman is afraid. Afraid of her own power. Afraid of herself. And afraid of men. And all for the sake of an erection. Let's play some music.
50) 8) dialog: This is supposed to be a duet.
50) 10) dialog: Nothing compared to you. I heard it the other night. You are an artist. He takes her left hand. He becomes very seductive.
50) 11) dialog: (continuing) Intonation. Vibrato. Stretch. You think I'm crazy. But I know music. It's the one thing that makes me humble.
50) 16) dialog: You have precision. That's not prissy. Precision is where passion begins. Passion. Even your thumb, your thumb position, you really keep the pressure on. Don't you? He caresses her thumb.
50) 17) dialog: (continuing) A lot of men give up. It hurts too much. But you... Look at that. This is the most... beautiful... callus. Jane is melting. But Daryl suddenly grabs her other hand.
50) 18) dialog: (continuing) But this hand! This is your failure! Your bowing. It sucks.
50) 20) dialog: Your spicato sounds like marcato your legato like detache. You kill the passion. Let it go. What are you holding back for? You're not just playing notes. You're playing phrases! Human outcries.
50) 22) dialog: (seductive again) Let it go. Let it fly. What are you afraid of? You have great passion in you. Let it out. I can take it. I want it. He puts the cello in her trembling hands. They start to play. Daryl coaches her. (CONTINUED )
50) 25) dialog: (continuing) Yes. Yes. That's it. Don't tighten up now. Relax. Breathe into it. Open up. Yes. Take your time. Let it wash over you. Let it tickle you. Play with it. Tease it. Feel it. All of it. Taste it. Hmn. Yes. That's good. Oh, yeah. Feel how it wants you. It wants to surround you. It wants to get inside you. No. Don't tighten up. You can handle it. There. There. There it is. Oh, yes. Can you feel it? Jane is moving into a state of sexual ecstasy.
50) 26) dialog: (continuing) You've got it now. Take it. Bear down. Ride it. Do it, Jane. Do it! The music soars. Jane is trembling with passion.

56) 21) dialog: I've been reading your work in that rag of a newspaper. You are a genius. Wasted. Pearls before swine. When are we going to do that little interview? I love interviews. So intimate.
56) 23) dialog: Head to head. The two of us. Banging away. Yes. Yes. But not today. Today is for tennis. He leads Sukie toward the tennis court. As he passes Alex and Jane...

57) 50) dialog: Hell hath no fury like you three. He gives Alex the new racket and kisses her on the cheek. Jane reacts.

57) 61) dialog: Maleficio!
57) 63) dialog: Okay. Had enough?
57) 65) dialog: No more fighting, no more petty jealousy -- are we all friends again?
57) 67) dialog: One for all, all for one. You show me yours. I'1l show you mine. For better and for worse -- what do you say? Do we have a deal?
57) 69) dialog: Till death do us part?
57) 71) dialog: Okay. Daryl snaps his fingers. A bolt of lightning screams out of the sky and hits the ground near the snake. But the snake is fine -- just more angry. The women are terrified. Daryl is annoyed.
57) 72) dialog: (continuing) Damn it. He snaps his finger again. A second and third bolt of lightning both miss the snake. (CONTINUED )
57) 75) dialog: (continuing) Oh, shit. He walks to the snake, grabs it by the tail, "snaps" it in the air and kills it. Then he picks up his racket and walks toward the house.

139) 0) text: Daryl is as surprised as we are to see where he is. A service was in progress until the great wind blew through the doors. The congregation and the minister back toward the walls. Daryl turns to face the wind. Summoning up all his strength, he fights his way to the doors and, gathering superhuman power, he pushes them closed. The WIND POUNDS at the building, but for the moment, Daryl has escaped it. He catches his breath. He is bruised badly, his clothing is torn and shredded and he is still hurting from the pain of the pins. Finally, he takes in the terrified congregation. He smiles.
139) 1) dialog: Sorry... uh... having a little trouble... having a little trouble at home. A little domestic situation. No need to be alarmed. A little female trouble, that's all. Hi. How are you? He laughs as he moves unsteadily up the aisle. The congregation continues to move away from him. The minister steers people toward the back of the church.
139) 2) dialog: (continuing) Women. Ha. Can't live with them, can't live without them. He doubles over suddenly, gags, opens his mouth and a stream of grapes comes out of it. The congregation is amazed. Daryl recovers...
139) 3) dialog: (continuing) Pay no attention. Pay no attention. Cheap trick. Anybody can do it. I taught it to them. Ungrateful little bitches, aren't they? Let me ask you something. You're all churchgoing folk. (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
139) 6) dialog: Let me ask you -- do you think God knew what he was doing when he created women? Huh? No shit, I want to know. Do you think he knew or do you think it was another of his little mistakes? Like earthquakes, and floods. Volcanos. Tidal waves. Just another little fuck-up in the divine plan. Like cancer. Do you think women are like that? He gags and spits out more feathers and grapes. The WIND ROARS outside the church. Daryl is having a harder time recovering from these fits and attacks.
139) 7) dialog: (continuing) What's the matter? You don't think God makes mistakes? Sure he does. We all make mistakes. ‘Course, we make mistakes and they call it evil. God makes mistakes and they call it nature. So what do you think? Women. A mistake? Or did he do it to us on purpose? I'd like to know. Because if it's a mistake, maybe we could do something about it. Find a cure. A vaccine. Build up the immune system. Eat broccoli. Geta little exercise. Maybe that's all it would take. Twenty pushups a day and you'll never be afflicted with women again. An excruciating pain pierces his brain. He grabs his head, falls to his knees. While he's down, the congrega- tion moves toward the doors and opens them. The wind rushes in. The people fight their way out of the church. Daryl starts banging his head against the floor.

145) 27) dialog: You got to be a little tough. Dog eat dog, man eat man -- that's the way it is. That's God's plan. Not mine. The women are running around trying to do everything for him.
145) 32) dialog: Could you toast it for me, Sukie?
145) 37) dialog: Sure. I know that. But that's what it comes down to, doesn't it? He starts to feel warm, uncomfortable.
145) 38) dialog: (continuing) We hurt each other to survive. We kill each other to survive. That's God's plan. No purpose. No grace. No beauty. He begins to twitch and transform, a growing darkness coming over him.
145) 41) dialog: It's a terrible creation, this world. An unholy war of nature. Life against life. A parasitic cellular conflagration. Daryl's body begins to do peculiar things -- jerking, changing shapes, as if an internal force were trying to burst through his skin.
145) 42) dialog: (continuing) You think goodness and beauty and kindness... You think that's the way to survive? All right. Let's try it.
145) 44) dialog: What do you say? Let's rise above nature. Huh? I am willing to compromise. Men and women. There must be a better way. What do you say we try to find it? You and me. Screw God. And nature. And all of nature's violence... (CONTINUED )

Or are they just playing? Once again it seems like they are communicating. CUTTING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN the babies and the video screens as the cartoon is replaced on each screen by another image. The babies look like they know what they're doing. As the puzzle comes together on the screens, we recognize the smiling face of Daryl Van Horne.
