33) 5) dialog: This is crazy. All I said was, 'Bring back some blood samples.' So what does he bring back? A giant gorilla.
33) 7) dialog: You know how much it cost to convert the tiger habitat? Try half our operating budget.
33) 9) dialog: Hey, I just said it was crazy.    I didn't say it wasn't worth it.
39) 5) dialog: Gregg, or the gorilla? They both turn as...
39) 10) dialog: I'm confused, O'Hara. You phone us to say you're bringing back a two thousand pound wild animal...
39) 13) dialog: ... but security tells me you've requested no firehoses, no restraints of any kind...
39) 15) dialog: How are we supposed to control the animal? With a giant, rolled-up...
39) 16) text: Harry trails off as Jill gets out of the car.
39) 17) dialog: ... newspaper?
39) 18) text: Harry wasn't prepared for somebody this young and beautiful. Neither was Cecily. They raise their eyebrows at Gregg.
39) 27) dialog: (stammering, scared) Mind?    No, of course I don't mind.
39) 31) dialog: Hold it!
39) 32) text: Harry whirls around and waves over a pair of nerdy, grad- school-geek conservancy workers, JACK and VERN. They run eagerly forward to take orders. They gawk at Jill, each one instantly deciding she is the woman of their dreams. Harry barks at them, bringing them back to attention.
39) 33) dialog: Jack? Vern?    Get the sedatives ready.
39) 35) dialog: Miss Young, we know what we're doing here, and the best way to...
40) 5) dialog: You sure she knows what she's doing? Gregg's watching Jill with quiet admiration.
40) 17) dialog: Hey! What do I pay you for?    Get some shots -- of me, too.
40) 18) text: Vern picks up a camera and scrambles to get into position -- but he's so nervous that he trips, sprawling on the ground and startling Joe. Joe turns and scampers back into the trailer. Vern gets back on his feet, red-faced. Jill glares at Harry. Gregg just chuckles at the stupidity. Harry blames Vern.
40) 19) dialog: What -- he did it.
40) 22) text: She heads into the trailer after him.      Harry and Ceci exchange incredulous looks.
40) 32) dialog: Alright.   Take the platform away.
40) 33) text: Jill is instantly alarmed.     She turns to Harry.
40) 35) text: Harry shakes his head and motions for the workers to proceed with removing the platform.
40) 36) dialog: No. We can't allow that. We don't have insurance to cover anyone in there who's not an employee.
40) 42) dialog: Yes. And I'm in charge of this facility.
46) 0) text: Cecily runs up to the front of the main building, where Harry is waiting for her.
46) 2) dialog: Beats me. He collected his pay check. He's probably in some jungle by now, not using deodorant.
46) 4) dialog: Excuse me, Gregg's expertise is pitching tents, not explaining primate behavior to the Chairman of the Conservancy Board.
46) 6) text: Know what I think, Harry?
46) 7) dialog: I have a feeling I'm gonna find out.
46) 9) dialog: Of Gregg? Don't be ridiculous. (beat)
46) 11) dialog: Just once I wanted to go into the field and find a new species... mollusk, anything. Instead, he makes the zoological discovery of the century.
46) 16) dialog: That's not funny.
46) 20) dialog: Elliot.   Good to see you again.
47) 0) text: Harry and Cecily walk with     a conservative-looking man his fifties, Elliot Baker,     the Chairman of the Board the conservancy. Harry is      working for brownie points excitedly pointing out his     "important role" in discov Joe.
47) 1) dialog: I always had a suspicion that the legend coming out of the Pangani forest might have some truth to it. It was just a hunch -- sort of a gut feeling -- but I sent my field zoologist to check it out.
47) 2) text: Cecily shoots a look at Harry. She's not going to let him grab the glory away from Gregg.
47) 8) dialog: (begrudging) Gregg O'Hara.
47) 10) text: This kills Harry. Cecily snickers.      They arrive at th fence surrounding Joe's habitat.
47) 11) dialog: Here we are.
47) 14) dialog: (calling) Joe! Here, Joe! (apologetic joke to Baker) I told him the Chairman of the Board was coming and he promised to come say 'hi.'
47) 17) dialog: Mmmm. We'll feed him.    That'll get him to come out.
47) 19) dialog: I know what I'm doing.   Let's open the gate.
50) 8) dialog: who, white as a sheet, hides behind a tree, his hands shaking. He doesn't dare move an inch, for fear Joe will spot him.
50) 11) text: Jill and Gregg come running up behind them.   Jill yells to Harry.
50) 19) text: Joe grabs a bush and tears it from the ground... The guards aim their rifles, fingers on triggers... And Harry, having nothing to lose but his life, jumps out from behind the tree...
50) 20) dialog: You found me!
50) 26) text: He screams with delight, and spins in a circle again. As it dawns on everyone that she's actually right, and that he's really playing, the guards start to lower their guns. Then they start laughing. An embarrassed Harry slinks by Gregg, who can't help but chuckle as he leaves.
51) 0) text: An exhausted Harry catches his breath at the gate around the habitat. Baker has a thoughtful look on his face.
51) 2) dialog: What? Elliot, she's got no scientific...
57) 0) text: CLOSE ON the sleepy face of a shaggy yak. PULL BACK TO a small group of V.I.P.s being led on a tour by Harry.
57) 1) dialog: This fellow is one of only three hundred wild yaks remaining on the planet. There are those who would ask, why should we care if this sub-species of yak survives? We SPOT a man blending in with the group. We recognize Garth. He looks quite respectable in a suit. The antsy V.I.P. next to Garth interrupts Harry.
57) 3) dialog: (charming)
57) 4) text: You certainly can -- for the mere price of a 'Diamond Circle Benefactor Ticket' to tomorrow night's benefit. The V.I.P.s laugh and groan. Garth takes this moment to slip away, unnoticed. Harry twinkles at the V.I.P.s.
57) 5) dialog: It's all for a good cause.
58) 0) text: Harry is waving good-bye to the V.I.P.s, who have completed their tour.
58) 1) dialog: Good-bye. Good-bye. (under his breath)
58) 7) dialog: (guilty) Of course I... actually, perhaps I...
58) 12) dialog: I'll go rush order it for you now.
58) 16) text: Cecily and Harry walk off grumbling at each other like an old married couple.
58) 17) dialog: I keep telling you -- stop talking to me like that.
62) 0) text: Gregg, Jill, Cecily and Harry watching Joe's rampage from outside the gate. Jack and Vern run over, covered in mud and overly exited.
62) 3) dialog: He just pulled out another acacia tree. You know what I paid for those?
62) 9) dialog: Well could you get in there and calm him down before he pulls out the rest of my landscaping?
67) 4) dialog: (dismayed)
67) 8) dialog: Hel-lo.   Look what we have here. Gregg and Cecily turn to see what Harry's looking at.
69) 4) dialog: (into mic)
69) 6) dialog: (nervous joke)
69) 11) dialog: But tonight, rather than focusing on what we've lost, I'm going to introduce you to something we've found.
69) 12) text: There is a tremendous CRACKING sound from behind the curtain. The audience murmurs. Harry sweats. Jill grabs Gregg's hand tightly.
69) 13) dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, the California Animal Conservancy proudly introduces our newest member, Mighty Joe...
69) 14) text: CRASH! Before Harry can say "Young," a TREE comes CRASHING through the curtain. Gregg leaps forward, knocking Harry out of the way just as the tree crushes the podium into kindling. Joe comes blasting through the hole in the curtain.    He has joined the party. Joe stands on the stage, his chest heaving. There is total silence. The party guests are frozen with fear, literally speechless. A few of them laugh nervously, wondering if this is really just part of the show. But Jill knows better. She and Gregg exchange glances -- what the hell is going on? Jill rises, trying to stay calm herself, and slowly approaches Joe, speaking in a soothing voice. She wants to get his attention.
72) 11) dialog: Jill?
72) 12) text: They turn to see Harry, poking his head in the room. He still looks freaked out from the events of the night.
72) 13) dialog: Can I talk to you for a second?
73) 0) text: Jill and Harry are in the observation area, a glassed-off room that looks into the holding cell. Harry is still extremely rattled from the fiasco of the night before. He's trying to act tough but he's torn up inside, not sur who he's worried about more -- Joe or himself.
73) 1) dialog: The City Attorney talked to Baker. It wasn't my decision, and there's nothing I can do about it.
73) 3) dialog: Joe stays in there until they decide what to do with him.
73) 5) text: In there? Harry, look at him. He's depressed, he won't eat. If he stays in there, he'll die within days.
73) 6) dialog: So sue me.    Everybody else is.
73) 8) dialog: Don't you get it? This is way beyond you, and me. Joe freaked out on some very influential people. He's a public relations nightmare. No zoo will take a two-thousand-pound killer gorilla...
73) 11) dialog: ... and unless you can write a check for millions of dollars to buy him a big back yard somewhere, Joe's got nowhere to go.
77) 7) dialog: Yeah. Don't start a fight with anyone bigger than you.
77) 8) text: Harry steps out of the shadows. Everyone turns and looks at him. He feels their eyes on him and shuffles a little.
77) 9) dialog: You'd better leave out of the west gate. The guard there got called away. Urgent business.
77) 10) text: Jill puts her arms around Harry.    He's antsy and embarrassed.
77) 12) dialog: (as she keeps hugging) Okay, okay, let go.
77) 13) text: Harry disengages from Jill and disappears back where he came from. Now Cecily turns to Jill.    She hugs her with great emot
