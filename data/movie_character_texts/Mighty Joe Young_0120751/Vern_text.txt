81) 13) text: Vern pulls a single high-heeled shoe out of the box and hands it to Cecily.
81) 15) text: Digging in the box again, Vern innocently pulls out the poacher's dog collar. It means nothing to him, but Gregg instantly grabs for it.

81) 23) text: It takes less than a second. Gregg springs into action, grabbing the keys to the Blazer out of Jack's hand. He sprints to the car. Jack and Vern watch him go.
