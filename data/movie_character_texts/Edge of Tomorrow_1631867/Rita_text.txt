A landscape of hel Cage COUGHS, OPENS HIS EYES. He's lying on his back, RAIN drizzling on his unprotected face, his BLOOD mixing in the puddles beside him. YONABUR BODY and the DEAD MIMIC SCOUTS are scattered around. A LIVING MIMIC is nearby, scavenging through the dead, ea bits of other fallen mimic. It hasn't noticed Cage, until CLICKING and WHIRRING, YONABURU'S EXOJACKET goes into pow down, releasing him like an insect's carapace. His dead, naked-except-for-underwear BODY slops into the mud and bl The eater of the dead LOOKS UP. Interested. ANOTHER MIMIC stands behind it. Oh fuck. Here they come. CAGE STRUGGLES to lift his 20mm, CLICK. CLICK. Nothing. T MIMICS RUN THIS WAY. CLICK. CLICK. Cage SCREAMS - - SHUP! The mimic's body is TORN IN HALF - A FLASH of RED EXOJACKET as THE SECOND IS CUT DOWN. We barely see it hap Just pieces of mimic falling, and in two seconds it's ove Cage blinks up at... RITA VRATASKI. 10. Her crimson exojacket shines in the afternoon sun. Her go spattered faceplate hovers over Cage, then RETRACTS as sh grabs a canteen from her utility belt. Rita may be the greatest warrior on the planet, but she c be more than 23 years old. And she's beautiful. Storm clouds part, BLUE SKY beyond, but rain still drizzl She drinks, looking up at the sky.

7) 24) dialog: Lt. Shep is demonstrating the iso- pushup. In Dog Company, we use it to practice discipline. The iso- pushup is the best training outside of a jacket you will get.
7) 26) dialog: To control your exojackets you must control your body. To control your body, you must control your mind. SWEAT drips from soldiers' noses. It's hardest for the biggest ones. Yonaburu TREMBLES - and COLLAPSES.
7) 29) dialog: This man's had enough.
7) 31) dialog: (quietly) Do I have something on my face, Private?

Rita is beautiful. And in that one frame, she looks like loneliest person in the whole world. Cage walks around the LIFESIZE HOLOGRAM, looking at her closely. He studies her melancholy face. She's frozen, standing in front of him like a translucent ghost... Their faces almost touching. But she's just a holovid image. Cage gestures, the image moves out of STILL, into MOTION - Rita's holovid bottle FLIES at Cage's face and we

FINALLY one manages to make him drop the game, Cage gets ANGRY. He throws himself into a HORDE of mimics. CAGE is a DEATH DEALER, killing without purpose, rhyme or reason, standing on a GROWING PILE of dead mimic, but MOR and MORE COME, he'll be buried soon, when - 78. WHAM, a HUGE-ASS mimic slides into several pieces as - - RITA leaps into the fray, fighting alongside Cage. Cage matches her moves, swing for swing. Cage has never fought this close to her before. RITA lands, striking a pose. Her radio CRACKLES -
72) 1) dialog: So. It's Cage, huh? Your jacket says you're a Private. You sure don't fight like a Private.
72) 3) dialog: You're pretty good.
72) 5) dialog: Your one weakness is that you fight like nothing matters. Something always matters. She demonstrates. It's like her focus is always on what's next, like she doesn't really hate the mimic one way or another - there is a beauty, efficiency in it. Cage hammers a few mimics back. Clumsy by comparison.
72) 7) dialog: Try. Don't think about what's next. Forget about what just happened. She swings, effortlessly dispatching more.
72) 8) dialog: You fight with your eyes. You've got to fight with your heart. Cage tries. The improvement is immediate. Mimic go flying they fight together. They are a perfect team. 79. Soon, Mimic litter the field. Smoke clears. Rita smiles.

76) 12) dialog: You got a good right hook, soldier.
76) 14) dialog: A jacket can't protect you from a mimic. Only your mind can. The mind is the greatest weapon you have. In the end, it is your only weapon. One of the soldiers, CAGE, keeps staring at her. His expression very serious, almost angry. Beside Cage, Yonaburu COLLAPSES, struggling to get back u

76) 25) dialog: I'll make you a deal. If you can hold the position longer than me, you can say whatever you want.
76) 27) dialog: You... had enough...?
76) 31) dialog: It's too bad. Now I wanna know what it was you had to say. But a deal's a deal. 86. Rita turns to walk away, surrounded by her celebrating me Yonaburu comes over, helping Cage up.

78) 3) dialog: Yeah. I just thought I was the only one it had ever happened to.
78) 5) dialog: No. I got out.
78) 7) dialog: It was in the Battle of Florida. I'd lied about my age when I joined up. I didn't know the first thing about being a soldier.
79) 2) dialog: We didn't have a chance in hell, but I was lucky, my Lieutenant was looking out for me. He kept me alive while everyone else in my Platoon got shredded. They FIGHT side by side - - but then LT. HENDRICKS goes DOWN, KILLED by a mimic wit
79) 4) dialog: He died, trying to save me. I lost my head and went after the mimic that killed him. The YOUNG RITA HUNTS DOWN the MIMIC, enabled by REVENGE a FURY alone. Her EXOJACKET is TORN HALF AWAY when she fina KILLS the thing, using her PILEDRIVER -—
79) 5) dialog: I killed it. And then I died. - SHE DIES, in the QUICKSILVER BLOOD of the ANTENNA MIMIC see the image fall apart, then RITA WAKES UP - IN HER BARRACKS, screaming, in her hammock. People STARE.
79) 6) dialog: I woke up the day before the battle had even started. I thought I'd gone crazy. RITA wanders the barracks like a ghost -
79) 7) dialog: I must have died twenty times before I pulled myself together and decided to stand and fight. ON THE BATTLEFIELD, RITA HAMMERS mimics with a REPEATER RIFLE, SNARLING as she is CUT DOWN in a SPRAY OF RED - 89.

79) 9) dialog: I was in four hundred eleven battles before I figured out how to break out of the loop. ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE, Rita now fights with a BATTLEAXE - when she sees a RAINBOW MIMIC, the first one she killed just like the one Cage killed, streaking across the field Her eyes NARROW, she RUNS AFTER IT and we
80) 2) dialog: The first time you died. Tell me exactly what happened.
80) 4) dialog: Do you remember what it was doing, when it... when you died?
80) 6) dialog: You killed an Antenna. While it was broadcasting. (MORE )
80) 8) dialog: When you killed that mimic, you got tangled up in the signal. Became a receiver. Just like I did.
80) 10) dialog: It's probably easier if I show you.
81) 1) dialog: You ever wonder why the mimic almost always know where we're going to strike next? - until all that we can see are hundreds of thousands of and RED DOTS converging, dissolving, repeating, almost li mathematical equation, on abstracted, 3-D terrain. Rita's face is dimly illuminated in the holobay.
81) 2) dialog: Look. BLUE DOTS head to a position... But RED DOTS get there fi
81) 3) dialog: Do you see the pattern?
81) 5) dialog: Let me speed it up. NOW the battle scuds by at high speed, the mimics POUR on the human defense forces, like SAND settling, shifting -
81) 6) dialog: Watch the movements. gl. And a pattern emerges: ONE SMALL CHANGE, then... EVERYTHI flows in a new direction. Pulsing from RANDOM ACTION... t FOCUSED ORDER.
81) 7) dialog: Now. Slow it down on that point. She scuds back and forth across a SHIFT, ZOOMING in...
81) 8) dialog: The shift happens... each time an Antenna gets killed.
81) 10) dialog: When an Antenna dies, it sends out a message. To the receivers. One RED DOT winks out. But the BLUE dot finds itself surrounded... TRAPPED.
81) 11) dialog: But the message travels backwards. Into the past. Nine red dots CONVERGE. The blue dot is EXTINGUISHED. The action REWINDS... the BLUE DOT moving back from the R DOT, until earlier, several RED DOTS move from their coho
81) 13) dialog: It's a perfect strategy when you think about it. You don't have to outsmart an enemy if you always know what they're going to do next. Nine red dots CONVERGE. Again, the blue dot is EXTINGUISH
81) 15) dialog: ..-yourself, thirty-six hours from now. Like memories, but of the future. Every possible future will play out, until you break the loop. 92.
81) 17) dialog: We have to find the Antenna you killed. The one that bled on you. Before you killed it. Before it sent the broadcast.
81) 19) dialog: We have to get the receivers too, or it won't work at all. But yeah. That's the idea. Cage nods, his head swimming.
81) 21) dialog: It's not. They'll know we're coming. They'll do whatever they need to kill you every time. (beat) They know how important you are. Cage frowns.
81) 23) dialog: If you break the loop, the mimic won't be able to tell what happens next. (beat) You'll be able to win the battle. Cage's eyes go wide. Rita smiles. On the holovid, STREAMS and EDDIES of MIMIC overpower hum forces, over and over, in a constant loop...

82) 4) dialog: Yeah. But I should warn you. I think being in the loop... did something to me. Sometimes I still pick up... fragments. Feelings, little things, the day before a battle. Like I can pretty much tell if someone's going to die. (beat) It's why I don't really talk to anyone the day before battle. They come to a crossroad; Rita's tower is one way, C-Comp barracks, the other.
82) 5) dialog: You should get your sleep. It's going to be a pretty big day.
82) 7) dialog: No. (beat) I think there are some people you can't save, no matter what. Rita turns and walks away. From the shadows, a couple Dogs give Private Cage the las their suspicious looks and fall in line behind her. 94.

85) 0) text: MIMICS swarm the field, coming by LAND, SEA and AIR. 95. We slip between EXTREME CLOSE-UPS OF ACTION, of Cage and Rita's faces, to WIDE STRATEGIC VIEWS of battle, RED and flags dancing and spinning in the heads-ups.

85) 3) dialog: And another. You see it?

85) 25) dialog: Cage?
85) 30) dialog: Cage! CAGE!

89) 1) dialog: (wiping her eyes) Sorry. I'm just... used to being alone.
89) 3) dialog: How'd you... figure it out?
89) 5) dialog: We have to find the Antenna you killed. And the receivers. I can show you how.
89) 7) dialog: Then why are you... here? Cage hesitates. He can't tell her the truth.
89) 9) dialog: Oh. I see. Rita eyes Cage, wondering just what she and this Private been doing, in his past, in her future.
90) 5) dialog: This is weird. I feel like you must know everything about me.
90) 8) dialog: I have to do something that makes me feel like myself. I kinda got used to it. Cage pours chocolate sauce over a pile of pickled eggs.

93) 5) dialog: That was... nice.
93) 7) dialog: It was weird, too.
93) 9) dialog: Why'd you join up? 105.
93) 11) dialog: I was sixteen. A farm girl. The town I grew up in, mimic scouts came up river, some hunters found them. They burned my town. I lost everything - my dad, my mom. My horse. (beat) I guess I joined the marines because I didn't want to live anymore. I figured if I could kill just one mimic, that would be enough and then I could die. I don't know what I was thinking. But I was lucky. There was this man. Lieutenant Arthur Hendricks. He found me. Showed me how to use my jacket.
93) 14) dialog: It's OK. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I was in love with him.
93) 16) dialog: I think he loved me too. But he had a family, so it was different... we never even talked about it. And besides, there was a war on. 106. WE SEE HER WINNING THE FINAL BATTLE, soldiers CHEERING in smoke while she WEEPS over the body of ARTHUR HENDRICKS -
93) 17) dialog: No matter how I played it, I could never save him. He was the real hero of that battle. He died, and I got a medal. No one ever knew. - and then, ON A STAGE, getting the Valkyrie Medal of Hon draped around her neck. It means nothing to her.
93) 19) dialog: When I finally got out of the loop, all I wanted was to get back in. To have one more chance to save him. (beat) I'd have traded the whole battle for it. Cage looks at her, not sure what to say.
93) 21) dialog: Yeah. Maybe so. She looks at Cage.
93) 22) dialog: Would you kiss me again?

94) 5) dialog: It's coffee. Real coffee. Some of the last in the world. She adds water, the dark brew drizzles into the pot.
94) 7) dialog: Almost. There's an island off the coast of Africa - one of the last places it'll grow. I fought there once and they still have it flown in for me. It doesn't seem right that I should have it all to myself. She pours some into his cup. Cage drinks. His eyes go wid
94) 9) dialog: It's probably the best cup of coffee you can get in the whole world. I mean, since no one gets to make coffee anymore. You have to do it just right or it's no good.
94) 11) dialog: (sadly) I'd like that. Rita looks down at her coffee.
94) 12) dialog: I was wondering. The last time we... were in the loop. You said we decided not to kill the Antenna?
94) 14) dialog: Well. I'm glad we decided to come back.
94) 17) dialog: The mimic are attacking early. They know we're together. (beat) We have to get out of here. Another JAVELIN hits the tower, pieces SHATTERING IN. Rit GRABS Cage and they PILE into the elevator, the tower SHUDDERING with multiple impacts.
