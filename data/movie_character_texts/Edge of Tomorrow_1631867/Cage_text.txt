Rita is beautiful. And in that one frame, she looks like loneliest person in the whole world. Cage walks around the LIFESIZE HOLOGRAM, looking at her closely. He studies her melancholy face. She's frozen, standing in front of him like a translucent ghost... Their faces almost touching. But she's just a holovid image. Cage gestures, the image moves out of STILL, into MOTION - Rita's holovid bottle FLIES at Cage's face and we

62) 6) dialog: For instance, did you know that the weather is totally unpredictable? They say a butterfly flapping its wings in Australia can make enough of a difference that, on the other side of the world a month later, there might be a hurricane, all because of whether or not that butterfly was having a bad day.

He knows EVERY MOVEMENT of each pe on this base swarming with busy people rushing to and fro We flip in and out of SLOW MOTION as - - a GUARD turns and looks at a piece of paper blowing acr the road - - CAGE STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM, just out of line of vision, neatly CROSSING THROUGH A CHECKPOINT and - - STEPPING ONTO THE BACK OF A MOVING TRUCK like you'd cat carousel horse.

(beat) So you should think, like really think about how you're going to spend this day. The more you prepare yourself, the harder you try to be the best soldier you can ever be, the better you're going to do tomorrow, and for that matter, the better you're probably gonna feel about whatever happens. Yonaburu covers his eyes, painfully embarrassed.
69) 11) dialog: I'm sorry to bum everyone out, but you gotta trust me on this one. This is probably your last chance to get it right. EVERYONE stares at Cage like he's crazy.

70) 5) dialog: It's the number of times I've seen you die. (wiping his mouth) It's OK, we all do. But you usually don't even make it through the drop. The main problem is that you're too fat. They shouldn't have let you in here. But they're out of fit soldiers. Kimmel wants to get up, but it's too late -
70) 6) dialog: Don't feel bad about it. That guy Davis over there? He won't ever make it out of the drop ship. And Roker? He ends up on fire, cooked in his own jacket. How fucked up is that? And Ford, he always manages to lose one of his arms. Sometimes the left, sometimes the right. It's the weirdest thing. (beat) Nance, on the other hand, she just totally freaks around the second hour of battle. Starts killing everyone around her until we have to take her down.
70) 8) dialog: You, you usually just drown, after you run away. (chewing) I don't think drowning's all that bad, really. Kimmel looks like he's gonna be sick..
70) 10) dialog: Because it's the one way I've figured to keep you from fighting tomorrow after that speech I gave. You're gonna get so freaked out that you're gonna take a Section Eight.
