11) 1) dialog: That was an extraordinary thing you did today, Charlie.
11) 3) dialog: It's Joanne.
11) 5) dialog: Oh sweetie. Is Ronald Reagan in your bedroom right now?
11) 7) dialog: Then I'm considerably more important than whoever is.
11) 10) dialog: "Double it."
11) 16) dialog: “Double it." You joined the side of the angels.
11) 18) dialog: What do you care, hon?
11) 25) dialog: Do you know Charles Fawcett?
11) 33) dialog: Do you know Ricky di Portinova?
11) 35) dialog: Charlie Fawcett's been a passionate advocate for the Mujahideen basically since the day the communists marched through the Kyber Pass. He's made a movie which I think is a beautiful and immutable articulation of the need for American aid to the Afghans.
11) 37) dialog: Yes. We're gonna run the movie this Friday night after a dinner party at the home of Ricky di Portinova.
11) 39) dialog: There'll be whiskey, women and wealthy donors.
11) 41) dialog: Just the opposite hot stuff. You're a Christian and you're a fucking patriot.
11) 43) dialog: Oh baby. You have no idea how much more you're about to do. I'll see you Friday night. (CONTINUED)
17) 8) dialog: {at a microphone) Would everyone take their seats, please. BONNIE tries to have a confidential moment with AMBER-- (CONTINUED)
17) 25) dialog: (from the microphone) I'm Joanne Herring, thank you so mich for coming.
17) 26) dialog: And of course we all want to thank Ricky and Sandy for the use of their beautiful ome . (CONTINUED)
17) 30) dialog: It's been three years since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Burning villages, raping women, killing scores of thousands of innocent, humble, peace loving, God loving Afghans, and sending scores of thousands more on a treacherous hike over the Himalayas to seek refuge in Pakistan. Charles Fawcett has made a film-- She's interrupted by APPLAUSE...
17) 31) dialog: Charlie Fawcett's made a film that tells the story of these people and the urgent need for America and the rest of the world to help them. Here it is. The lights dim down and the movie begins. From the outset can see that the production values and filmmaking skill a brutally unsophisticated. There's a NARRATOR and a score lifted from a Hollywood movie. Two AFGHANS on horses are dubbed in English.
18) 14) dialog: I'm so sorry for keeping you waiting.
18) 16) dialog: Charlie, look at you, you're the sexiest man in politics.
18) 18) dialog: Gixls, would you excuse us please.
18) 24) dialog: Amber, you say hi to your daddy for me.
18) 26) dialog: (to BONNIE) And dear, if you could ask someone for a Bombay martini up, very dry?
18) 28) dialog: Oh isn't that wonderful for you.
18) 30) dialog: Two olives, please. Tell ‘em it's for me, they'll know.
18) 32) dialog: What did you think?
18) 34) dialog: Yes.
18) 37) dialog: Yeah I'm not submitting the fucking thing for a Golden Globe nomination, Charlie, you know what I'm talking about.
18) 39) dialog: Charlie~-
18) 41) dialog: Yes, I believe my government is aware but I was wondering what they were thinking of doing about it other than boycotting the Olympics, which I think you'll agree was a fairly impotent response to the greatest national security threat we've faced since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
18) 43) dialog: It's not. What I'm asking is is exactly how much power do you have as a member of the sub-committee.
18) 45) dialog: Foreign Operations.
18) 47) dialog: And the Defense Sub-Committee?
18) 56) dialog: It's also unlimited.
18) 58) dialog: You sit at the vortex of the State Department, the Pentagon and the CIA. You meet in a soundproof room in the Rayburn Building, and you preside over a secret and unlimited budget for the three agencies you would need to conduct a covert war. Isn't that right?
18) 60) dialog: Isn't that how you were able to double the CIA budget for black approps in Afghanistan just by saying so?
18) 70) dialog: They're doing it badly.
18) 72) dialog: They're arming them with 12.7 mm Dish-K machine guns which would be good except the Soviets have specifically armor- plated their Hind helicopters to resist a 12.7 mm shell. We sold Pakistan the F~ 16's but refused to equip them with "look down, shoot down" radar. Why won't the U.S. give Pakistan's pilots the same equipment we're giving the Israelis. If f this were a real war, State would issue a @ White Paper outlining the Communist threat the way they did in El Salvador. If this were a real war, there'd be a National Bipartisan Commission on Afghanistan headed by Henry Kissinger the way there is for Central America. If this were a real war, Congress would authorize $24 million for covert operations like you're doing in Nicaragua and if this were a real war, the NSC would dramatically increase the strength of the Mujahideen through direct training and weapons,
18) 74) dialog: I want you to save Afghanistan for the Afghans, deliver such a crushing defeat to the Soviets that communism crumbles, and in so doing, end the Cold War. (CONTINUED)
18) 80) dialog: Come here.
18) 82) dialog: Come here. CHARLIE takes a few steps toward JOANNE and she meets him halfway. They're standing very close and as she speaks it almost seems like she's either going to kiss him or slide hand down his pants...
18) 83) dialog: I know you think of yourself as a drunk and a fuck up but you're not. You have such greatness in you. And you're needed now. I don't care how many women you sleep with, that's what great men do, and by the way, pick up the phone and I'll show up anywhere you say, wearing anything you like, and I'll fuck you till you black out. You should believe everything you've heard about me. CHARLIE moves away and lights a cigarette.
18) 85) dialog: Go to Pakistan and meet with Zia.
18) 87) dialog: Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
18) 89) dialog: I've already arranged it. (CONTINUED)

45) 7) dialog: Well thank you, but I've been passionately involved with the cause of the Afghans for three years and I've been there many times.
45) 12) dialog: (to GUST) How'd you hook up with Charlie? Were you also passionately involved with cause of the Afghans?
