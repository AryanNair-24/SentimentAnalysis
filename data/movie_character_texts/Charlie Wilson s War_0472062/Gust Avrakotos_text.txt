One wall o office is glass, which looks out onto a large bullpen of support staff. At the moment, a MAINTENANCE WORKER is putting the finish touches on a replacement pane of glass. Sitting across the desk from GRAVER is GUST AVRAKOTOS. GU appearance-~slightly rumpled jacket and tie, tinted glass shoes that have been worn too much--suggests that he's a wholesale liquor distributor rather than what he really i which is a 20 year veteran of America's intelligence gath and covert services. One of the Agency's most well connec spies.

12) 38) dialog: Is that right?
12) 41) dialog: 3000 agents. Bach and every goddam one of ‘em first or second generation Americans. Did they lack the proper diplomatic skills? Or did Turner not think it was a good idea to have spies who could speak the same language as the people we were spying on.

13) 2) dialog: (evenly) My loyalty? (beat) For 24 years people have been trying to kill me, people who know how. You think that's because my dad was a Greek soda pop maker, or you think that's because I'm an American spy? Go fuck yourself you fucking child. GUST returns the gun to the small of his back. He winks a SECRETARY, who smiles a little back at him. Then-~

14) 7) dialog: She asked me do I want a professionali curse or a health curse. I said a professional curse, ‘cause, you know, while I'd like to see Graver get fucked hard and in all the wrong places, I don't wish ill-health should fall on someone.
14) 9) dialog: I gave her 80 dollars.
14) 12) dialog: She said, "You want evil to happen to him", I said, "Yes".

30) 14) dialog: I know, that's a helluva flight too. Nine hours flying time against the jet stream, you probably had to stop in Brussels, plus the time difference? I'd be a little grumpy myself.
30) 16) dialog: We wanted to give you this-- (handing CHARLIE a bottle of scotch) --'cause we know you like single malt.

33) 101) dialog: How? How are you gonna get the approval of Congress when they're saying no to the Contras which was a request made by the President.
33) 112) dialog: All you need are the 49 other Committee Members?

76) 18) dialog: This guy's two sons-in-law are the leaders of the al-Konar arm of the Mujahideen. We gave them 44-million in weapons and supplies and I oversaw their training myself. We might want to be a little more careful about that.
76) 29) dialog: That's a good plan, ‘cause that definitely wouldn't stir anti-American sentiment. Plus I'm sure he's the only one, once we get him that'll be it.

Because at this moment over half the population of Afghanistan is under 14 years old. And they're gonna come home from the camps and they're gonna find that their villages have been napalmed and their fathers are dead.
76) 54) text: GusT Yes. Yes I do. In fact I think we should've said, "Sure we'll give you the guns, but first you have to build some schools. Let's see your 14 year old boys pass general knowledge tests in history and science. When they pass 'em we'll give you the bullets.”

They pray five times a day to a God who requires more sucking up than a movie eager to die in huge numbers with the expectation that they'll be met in Paradise by 70 virgins, who, by the way, I'm not entirely convinced are meant to be women. I’m not worried, though, ‘cause I know if Islamic fanaticism ever gets outa hand, Joanne Herring and her friends will rise up to meet it with Christian fanaticism and then we've got ourselves a ball game. And I wouldn't be that concerned.except we just sent enough weapons over there to kill everyone on both sides.
76) 66) dialog: They don't get home delivery of The New York Times, plus it was covert, so it's unlikely that they're ever gonna know the role we played. What they're gonna be is poor, broken and off-the-charts stupid like no stupid you've ever seen. Their leaders are gonna tell them that we used them to fight our war, they're gonna see us in Israel and they're gonna be mad. I come from this mentality, Charlie. We made it and they didn't and they're gonna think it's our fault. We whipped them into a religious frenzy and--
76) 68) dialog: --taught ‘em how to fuck with the army of a superpower. (beat) That's what we did. (showing the paper again) So I'm just saying we should be a little more careful. BONNIE steps out--
76) 71) dialog: I know. You're all right. They go step into--
77) 8) dialog: (raising his glass to the TV) And here's to you you motherfuckers. Everyone in the room CHEERS Gust's sentiment. CHARLIE's e standing right next to GUST.
