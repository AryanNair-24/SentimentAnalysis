And one day I heard a whole crowd screaming next door so I ran over to Mr. Hazard's. About 15 people were standing around my dog, Teddy, who was writhing on the ground in very obvious agony. Blood was pouring out of his mouth. My mother was there too, and she wouldn't let me go near the dog 'cause she was afraid he was rabid. Mr. Hazard had ground up some glass and put it in a bowl of dog food and fed it to him.
28) 6) dialog: I burned his flower bed down. But that wasn't satisfying enough. And I remembered that Mr. Hazard was an elected official, he was head of the Town Council and his re-election every two years was a foregone conclusion. So on Election Day, I drove over to the black section of town, which had never voted in these elections. I was only 13 but I had a farmer's license and I drove over and filled my car with voters, drove ‘em to the polling place, waited, and then drove "em home. And before they got out of the car to vote, I'd say, "I think you should know that Mr. Hazard poisoned my dog." 400 people voted in that election, I drove a 96 of them to the polls. Hazard lost by 16 votes. I knocked on his door and I said that, "Your black constituents have just voted yon out of office. Don't kill anymore dogs." And that's how I fell in love with America.
