After a while he comes to the dunes overlooking the beach Carl parks the jeep and steps out. He walks over the dunes. On his back is a big backpack from which little black flags are sticking out. Carl stops on top of one of the dunes and looks across the beach. Clearly, this is a post-war landscape. As far the eye can see the beach is covered with lines of barbwire and signs saying. ‘DANGER! MINES.' Carl pushes some sand off with his foot. (He looks at a mine map) A wooden plank (Pansermine) appears beneath the sand. Carl puts his backpack down and digs further up ahead. Another plank appears. Carl puts his backpack back on and walks along the planks down towards the sea. He treads carefully, it is obvious that the entire beach is littered with mines. You can even see some of them poke up through the sand. Carl goes all the way to the water before he stops. He looks down the beach. He pulls a flag out of his backpack and sticks it into the sand.
