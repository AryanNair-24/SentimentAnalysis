Manfred(16), Werner(17), Ernst(17), Helmut(19), Ludvig(16), Wilhelm(15) and so on. 12 boys in all. They are just teenagers, nevertheless their youngish faces have a worn-out look to them. Like they have borrowed them from much older, and more experienced men. Hard and weary. The boys all look like they have been starving, some more than others. They are in various types of uniform. All of which are worn and torn. Two of the boys (Werner and Ernst) are like two peas ina pod. They are obviously twins. Hidden from the view of the others, they are holding hands. Sebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth that covers the back of the truck. He squints as the setting sun gets in his eyes. The truck is driving along a straight road through a forest near the Danish North Sea coastline.
4) 0) text: Sebastian and the other boys walk in a line down a long hallway. They are shown into the sleeping quarters. A small room. Filled with bunk beds without mattresses. Sebastian looks around. It seems most of the beds are occupied. Sebastian spots an empty bed, next to the window. He sits down on the bed. One of the older boys, Helmut(19), comes over. He looks at Sebastian. He stands there for a long time before he speaks.
4) 1) dialog: Move. That's my bed. Sebastian looks at the boy. Clearly, this is not his bed. Sebastian thinks about standing his ground. Decides against it. He gets up.
8) 10) dialog: Yeah? What was the funny bit? The others laugh even harder.
8) 11) dialog: I don't see what is so funny.
8) 13) dialog: Yeah, I get that. And? You think that is funny? The others don't know whether to continue laughing or ... Helmut looks angrily at Manfred.
8) 14) dialog: Why are you shaking your head!? Because of me? Manfred doesn't answer.
8) 15) dialog: You think you are funny? Or do you think I am stupid?

8) 30) dialog: So? I will tell you what. You would never have been able to do, what I did in the war. You know why? Because you lack courage! A good leader and soldier should have courage and never show fear. Sebastian doesn't answer. Helmut is right in front of Sebastian. Right in his face. In a calm voice he says.
8) 31) dialog: You think I don't know your kind? Is that what you think? You think I don't recognize a stupid little blue-collar boy, when I see one? Helmut smiles.
8) 32) dialog: Oh yes. A stupid little working- class nobody. That is what you are, right? Sebastian suddenly looks up at Helmut. With a quick movement Sebastian grabs Helmut by the throat with one hand. He tightens his grip. Helmut tries to get Sebastian to let go. Sebastian stares straight into Helmut's eyes.

They are all belly down on the sand. Several have taken off their uniforms in the intense heat. Wilhelm the youngest of the boys are on top of the dunes. He throws a handful of sand down onto the boy below in the sand. The sand startles the boy. When he looks up. Wilhelm ducks down out of sight. William does it a few times. The boy finally gets up and looks around. Still nothing to see.

Otto jumps through the stream. He picks up the ball. And runs back towards Carl. Suddenly there is a huge explosion. Otto the dog stepped on a mine. Everything is dead quiet. The only sound is Otto whimpering. The dog is not dead. Carl runs over. He sits down. Holds the dog. The boys stay in the background, watching. They don't know what to do.
