Manfred(16), Werner(17), Ernst(17), Helmut(19), Ludvig(16), Wilhelm(15) and so on. 12 boys in all. They are just teenagers, nevertheless their youngish faces have a worn-out look to them. Like they have borrowed them from much older, and more experienced men. Hard and weary. The boys all look like they have been starving, some more than others. They are in various types of uniform. All of which are worn and torn. Two of the boys (Werner and Ernst) are like two peas ina pod. They are obviously twins. Hidden from the view of the others, they are holding hands. Sebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth that covers the back of the truck. He squints as the setting sun gets in his eyes. The truck is driving along a straight road through a forest near the Danish North Sea coastline.

Underneath the mine is another mine. Werner looks over at his twin brother, Ernst. An enormous explosion goes off. The effect of two mines. Werner evaporates. Ernst's face gets splattered by the blood and flesh of his own brother. He is stunned. Then he jumps up and runs desperately over to Werner's area. He looks for his brother, calls out his name. Werner is spread all over the place. Ernst staggers about inside the mine field, confused, shocked looking for pieces of his twin brother. He screams. Ludvig and Sebastian come over. They overpower Ernst and hold him down. Helmut who has seen everything just sits there, stunned, his hands keep on working, though. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a piece of Werner's body stuck in a low sand pine tree just off to his side. Helmut works faster and faster. Sebastian runs over and try to stop him.
