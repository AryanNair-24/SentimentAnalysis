After a while he comes to the dunes overlooking the beach Carl parks the jeep and steps out. He walks over the dunes. On his back is a big backpack from which little black flags are sticking out. Carl stops on top of one of the dunes and looks across the beach. Clearly, this is a post-war landscape. As far the eye can see the beach is covered with lines of barbwire and signs saying. ‘DANGER! MINES.' Carl pushes some sand off with his foot. (He looks at a mine map) A wooden plank (Pansermine) appears beneath the sand. Carl puts his backpack down and digs further up ahead. Another plank appears. Carl puts his backpack back on and walks along the planks down towards the sea. He treads carefully, it is obvious that the entire beach is littered with mines. You can even see some of them poke up through the sand. Carl goes all the way to the water before he stops. He looks down the beach. He pulls a flag out of his backpack and sticks it into the sand. Then we walks along the water.

Manfred(16), Werner(17), Ernst(17), Helmut(19), Ludvig(16), Wilhelm(15) and so on. 12 boys in all. They are just teenagers, nevertheless their youngish faces have a worn-out look to them. Like they have borrowed them from much older, and more experienced men. Hard and weary. The boys all look like they have been starving, some more than others. They are in various types of uniform. All of which are worn and torn. Two of the boys (Werner and Ernst) are like two peas ina pod. They are obviously twins. Hidden from the view of the others, they are holding hands. Sebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth that covers the back of the truck. He squints as the setting sun gets in his eyes. The truck is driving along a straight road through a forest near the Danish North Sea coastline.
