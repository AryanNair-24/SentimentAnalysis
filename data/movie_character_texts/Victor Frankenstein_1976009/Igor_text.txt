Igor and Gordon fall over the edge, but Igor catches hims dangling by one hand over a fifteen foot drop to the roof the school’s greenhouse. Gordon COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, swinging at him easily and gracefully, SLASHING WILDLY.

Meanwhile, Gordon is easily monkeying around upside-down on the interior ceili of the greenhouse, smashing through panels to take wild swings at Igor. Igor makes the leap to the roof, and Gordon comes smashin into him from behind; the impact is enough to literally k one of Igor’s shoes off, but his training as a clown help him to roll with the impact. Gordon roars again, and charges once more; a chase begins over the roof of the college, which we the audience along with Igor realize is actually many buildings, built only few feet apart. Igor, jumping these gaps with this monstrosity mere secon behind him and gaining, realizes what he has to do. Jumping past a wind-vein, Igor rips it free, and at the n gap, TURNS AND BASHES GORDON ACROSS THE FACE. Gordon is disoriented mid-jump, and begins to fall into t gap between the buildings, BUT GRABS IGOR, PULLING HIM DO

24) 7) dialog: Victor dreams of a world filled with hope, instead of fear. A world where a mother who dies during childbirth can live to see her son, where a murdered man can personally identify his murderer. Where a paralyzed soldier with shrapnel embedded in his spine can be killed, healed, and then be brought back to life to walk again. The possibilities are endless...

It’s just that in a city of this size, many of the hospitals are unclean or poorly kept; the notion of a hospital is a positive one, it’s the execution, the lack of public support, the acceptance of under- qualified doctors and nurses that allows the sort of infective cross pollination you’re describing.

45) 2) dialog: Good evening. Listen, I’m just here on business. I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind giving me some directions up to the castle- The door bursts open, and a BELGIAN COUNCILMAN along with TOWN HEAVY.
46) 0) text: Igor, exhausted, his back aching, makes it to the bridge the dried out moat. He stumbles and nearly falls, out of breath, filthy and soaking wet. He creeps around the side of the castle, looking for a wa in. Finally, he comes to the base of huge, gnarly, overgr tree. Igor climbs up and through the branches, finally at the t he’s able to plan a jump across to the castle’s top wall walkway. One of Finnegan’s guards walks past, and Igor nearly fall out of the tree in his effort to conceal himself. The gua passes, and Igor pulls himself up and flings himself acro
47) 0) text: Igor sneaks along the upper wall, finally coming to a bre in the wall where he can see down into the courtyard, whe Victor's laboratory is set up. It is INCREDIBLE. Giant-size versions of all his laboratory machinery have set up, abuzz with power, and a huge scaffolding system h been set up around a raised platform next to one of the towers; the scaffolding goes up fifty feet into the air, atop it sits Victor’s hypothetical lightning magnet, the CLOUD HOOK. On the platform stands Victor and Dettweiler; Victor wear completely awesome looking buttoned up labcoat, with huge gnarly looking goggles on his forehead. Dettweiler wears black version of much the same. Between them is a massive gurney, but Igor can’t get a go look at what’s on it... To Igor, who saw all this when it was just a pipe-dream, breathtaking. There are several other scientists/technici in lab-wear working the machines, supervised by Finnegan, looks excited. 100. He stealthily moves to the lower level, and quietly sneak through the lab, moving towards Victor and Dettweiler on platform. And as the gurney tilts up, there it is: The PROMETHEUS is just over ten feet tall, stitched toget for over two dozen different donors. Its body is gargantu and misshapen; its head is oddly shaped, the face wide an bizarre, a mess of features stretched and jigsawed togeth to create a simulation of humanity. Igor watches as Victor goes under one of the big machines into the inner-workings.
47) 3) dialog: Victor. Victor turns wto see Igor, having snuck in from the other side, lit by the flashes of electricity give the cramped space an ethereal light. He doesn’t seem to have any kind reaction.
47) 5) dialog: You have to stop the experiment.
47) 8) dialog: Turpin’s in the town.
47) 10) dialog: He’s in the town, he’s coming here-
47) 12) dialog: I really don’t think that matters to him anymore.
47) 14) dialog: It’s a soldier, Victor. Victor stops dead.
47) 15) dialog: He’s used you.
47) 17) dialog: You've created the prototype for a weapon, Victor, a living weapon-
47) 19) dialog: Have you known me to lie? Once? Ever? The machine sparks, and Victor flinches.
47) 20) dialog: Finnegan tried to have me killed, Victor. I’ve come here to save you, as I believe he intends to kill you too when you’ve outlived your usefulness and given him what he wants. We can still get out of this, Victor, but you must stop the experiment.
47) 24) dialog: No- Victor, help me! Victor, coming out from under the machine, seems a millio miles away; his expression is unreadable.
47) 28) dialog: Don’t do this, Victor, don’t let it happen- One of the guards punches Igor in the face, shutting him Victor flinches.
47) 35) dialog: No, this isn’t- this isn’t- OUTSIDE... 103. Turpin and his mob of villages have arrived, in a fervor. They’re using the plow to ram the main gate, again and ag
47) 63) dialog: Victor! THE PLATFORM FLIPS as it completely comes free of the elevator machinery, and Igor goes crashing to the- SLAM TO BLACK.
47) 66) dialog: All right...easy...easy... Another crash at the gates. The Prometheus’s face remains entirely blank.
47) 67) dialog: Just- The Prometheus grunts, and then SWATS IGOR INTO THE AIR; bounces hard off some equipment, damaging it, and lands o the ground bent double in pain; he tries to stand, but fi he can’t... .--The damn back-brace is broken, trapping him into his o hunchbacked position. He can barely move, much less stand
49) 0) text: Turpin stumbles in, still looking over his shoulder, and turns to see the lab. The smoke is thick in the courtyard now; you can barely see in some areas. Finnegan prowls through the smoke, gun drawn, twitchy. Igor, on nearly the other side of the courtyard, struggle with his back-brace, seeing Finnegan searching for him. H crawls, desperate. 107. Turpin moves amongst the anarchy, in awe of all the burni sparking, exploding equipment. He sees Igor crawling, and moves towards him like a bullet.
49) 1) dialog: Inspector Turpin- please listen- you don’t know, you don’t know what’s happened here, you’re not- Turpin isn’t hearing it; he grabs Igor, yanking him up; I can barely move. Turpin’s got a look of insane exhilarati on his face; this is it, the moment he’s waited for!
49) 3) dialog: Please- you’re in danger- Finnegan, up on a bank of equipment, sees movement throug the smoke, raises his gun and fires. Turpin blinks, releasing Igor.
49) 5) dialog: No- no no- Turpin, in shock, coughing up blood, looks up at Igor, watching as Igor tears off his own sleeve, trying to stop bleeding.
49) 7) dialog: I’m a doctor. It’s what I do. Turpin, through the shock, is looking around at all the technology; he didn’t understand, he knows that now. By g he thought he knew, but he had no idea.
49) 11) text: Igor, trembling, stares at Finnegan; there’s a tremendous hate in his eyes, and Finnegan, feeling it, steps back, intimidated despite his position of total control.
49) 12) dialog: You're a monster.
49) 18) dialog: You saved my life again.
49) 20) dialog: The fires? But Victor-
49) 22) dialog: Victor- 110.
49) 24) dialog: NO VICTOR. You're going to come with me, and you're going to help me kill the Prometheus-
49) 26) dialog: Damn it, enough! Enough! I’ve seen you do wondrous things Victor, some terrible but wondrous things. You’re the greatest mind of your generation, but your blindness has already cost too much! (summons up courage) I’ve seen the way your father treats you! This will never be good enough for him! Nothing you ever do will be good enough for him, you could resurrect all of England and he would scoff and call you a disappointment! You can’t bring your brother back! At this, Victor stops trying to put out the fires. He sta into the flames; the lab continues to explode around them but he’s motionless.
49) 27) dialog: You were the one who gave me the strength I needed to become the man I wanted to be. Now trust me, please. Stop pretending not to care about anyone or anything, and Victor, damn it, grow up and help me stop this thing before it hurts anyone else. BE A MAN AND TAKE
50) 0) text: Victor and Igor, bruised, battered and bloody, approach t massive Dutch Windmill on the side of the hill; the villa are gathered around it. At first it appears they have the Prometheus trapped in t house portion, but then the Prometheus tromps out and tak few people down, before going back in.
51) 0) text: Victor kicks in the door; Igor comes in through a massive hole in the wall next to the door. They exchange a look. The farmhouse is sparse, and the inside is completely destroyed, broken furniture everywhere.
51) 2) dialog: It's alright, we’re here to- The MONSTER SMASHES OUT OF A ROOM TO THEIR RIGHT, FLOORIN IGOR. Victor opens fire wildly as the creature crosses th room; he mostly misses, and the bullets that do hit have almost no effect. The creature grabs the girl in one of its massive hands, roars at Victor and crashes through a wall into the insid the windmill.
52) 0) text: The interior of the windmill stretches out above them, th inside lit by torches. There are a series of flimsy woode platforms built around the central windmill machinery, connected by diagonal ladders, leading up to the top. The monster stands at the bottom, above a big well full o water, dunking the terrified little girl. 112. Victor hurriedly picks up one of the long, sharp steel po they use as bolts on the well, as Igor strafes around the monster.
52) 13) dialog: What?
52) 16) dialog: I’m not going to leave you here- 114. Igor begins pushing on the monster; it sloooowly slides u the shiskabob, far too slowly with the windmill collapsin this rate. Victor grabs Igor with his good arm.
52) 20) dialog: I believe you.
52) 22) dialog: Oh, you’ve sealed my fate. There’s no way I’m going to leave you now.
52) 24) dialog: Because you didn’t kill Igor Straussman. Igor throws all his weight into one more push, and, miraculously, the Prometheus drops, falling through the center level of the windmill, plummeting down into the fi Igor glances down again at the well, now also surrounded fire and jagged rubble.
52) 25) dialog: Give me your hand. Victor nods, and takes Igor’s hand; Igor begins to agonizingly pull him up the steel rod- 115.
54) 0) text: The sun is rising over a mountain range. The little cotta has clearly been abandoned for some time; Castle Erskine in the distance, still leaking smoke up into the brighten sky. From here we have a beautiful view of a rustic lake. Turpin, his chest bandaged, sits staring out over the wat at the sunset; he’s clearly deep in thought. Igor slowly approaches him. Turpin speaks without looking at him.
54) 3) text: TURPIN (CONT’D) All I wanted, all that mattered, is that I would see my daughter again. And you've given me that. (beat) I don’t imagine that I have much credence left at the yard, but...Should you return to England, I can see to it you won’t be troubled any further. Igor gives it a beat, and then smiles. The two of them si staring out at the water.
55) 0) text: Victor, heavily bandaged and clearly a bit weary from his wounds and considerably rough night, is readying two hors packing his remaining equipment into the saddlebags. Igor stands nearby.
55) 2) dialog: ...we’re not?
55) 4) dialog: But Victor-
55) 6) dialog: Victor, I... 117.
55) 8) dialog: I can’t go with you. (quickly) I would, I- I can’t. Lorelei is waiting for me back in London. I love her, Victor, and there are- opportunities for me- I can have a life of my own, Victor. A real life. Victor stares at him. Igor drops his eyes, terrified; he knows what's coming.
55) 10) dialog: ...what?
55) 12) dialog: Victor! Igor rushes to and embraces Victor, who grunts in pain an generally looks uncomfortable. Igor holds on anyway, cryi overcome with joy.
55) 13) dialog: You are a good man, Victor Frankenstein. I knew you were a good man. At this, Victor allows himself a small, warm smile, unsee Igor. LATER... Turpin is readying a horse, whilst Victor is astride one, trotting away down the road from Igor.
55) 14) dialog: Goodbye Victor! 118.
