We can hear the radio from inside the v (and just make out the name painted on the side: Klein Gu Service) in the middle of a report about the blackout. Th van careens out of sight, followed by the rise of an approaching police siren. Rose instinctively pulls the boy closer to the door of th museum. Then she gets an idea. She brings the boys back inside the museum and locks the door behind her. But we remain outside, watching as they vanish into the d building. We begin to float upwards, coasting along the side of the museum, a movement that feels as if we’re caught on a gen breeze. The steadiness of the movement, however, is in contrast t the sounds we hear, the indications of violence and dange somewhere in the darkness. But as we continue our ascent up the side of the building the sounds begin to diminish. We find ourselves at the roof of the museum with the roun skeleton of the Unisphere silhouetted against the night s Trees shake. We travel onwards, across the roof now, past the ducts an air vents and flag poles, the debris gathered along the gutter of the roof. The sounds are almost all gone now. WONDERSTRUCK 93. And finally, we reach our destination. We've caught up with Rose, Ben and Jamie, who have come t the roof for refuge. They are standing in the gutter, looking down over a low wall. Rose squeezes Ben’s arm, then she points to Jamie, wantin know who he is. Unnoticed by Rose are more sounds in the background. A cr a shout. Rose repeats herself, signing: Who is this? Ben looks at Jamie, who looks back at him. A kind of understanding passes between them. Ben touches his palm to his chest (indicating: my) then raises his right hand and begins to fingerspell:
116) 3) dialog: Friend. Rose takes Ben’s hand. He looks up at her with love. He t to Jamie, with the same dazzled look, and takes Jamie’s h Their faces, lit by moonlight, shine with surprise. They turn to the unlit skyline of Manhattan: quiet, dark, mysterious. Above it, hovering in the sky, a canopy of stars as clear bright as any in Gunflint Lake. The big dipper shines lik diamonds vaulting through the night. At this distance, in the strange silence, the city has be a place of peace. And at this moment the three of them are happy, looking a the stars. Jamie points up. Ben and Rose look. A meteor blazes across the sky.
