She is carefully loading a brush full of rubber ce onto the back of her clipping, coating the edges. She is carefully placing it in a large bound scrapbook and press down the corners. We can make out part of what it says as blows on it to dry: Will our brightest star turn out to be a permanent fixtur the heavens, or will she be a comet, who burns brightly f brief moment and then vanishes? She returns a toppled post-card from its place on her win sill. The card reads: Feb., 1927 - Happy Birthday, Rose, Walter and is addressed to: Miss Rose Kincaid, 168 River Street, Hoboken NJ.

The set is a 1920's version of a garden in an 18th century French esta Rose suddenly stops dead in her tracks. There, onstage, is LILLIAN MAYHEW herself. She is dressed a 18th century costume with an adorned white powder wig, playing the young French noblewoman, ADELIS. Onstage with her is an actor playing her young handsome suitor, VALENTIN, and a man playing the elderly tutor, MONSIEUR RAQUEU. Two additional actors stand on either si of Raqueu, dressed as Sentries. At Adelis’s command, the two Sentries have just let go of Raqueu, who brushes off his clothing, indignantly. Lillia then addresses him, moving from one beam of light to the next. Despite her heavy theatrical make-up and oversized gestures, Lillian Mayhew is every bit as beautiful in the flesh as she is in her photographs.
