That lunatic Russian android they put on me yesterday isn’t like men I have come up against before. He was a relentless Olympian. That was the closest I have come to termination in the last ten years. It wasn’t me that saved me, it was a banana skin here and a rabbit foot there. In other words, luck. You want to send me back to the cell, send me. I’11 go. But I am done here. A MAN wearing a hat enters, shutting Sanders up. Solo looks over his shoulder as the Man raises his head, Kuryakin. They both look as surprised as the other about unlikely meeting. 24. Without another word, they spring into action.

33) 11) dialog: It’s going to be fine. Kuryakin smiles and takes her hand.
33) 14) dialog: That’s perfectly normal, you'll get used to the feeling. He sees the dress.
33) 17) dialog: I think you should leave this department to me, no offense but...
33) 20) dialog: Really, now you're a Russian fashion expert? And that suit is your qualification?
33) 23) dialog: Good work.
33) 25) dialog: Your job was to give me time.

34) 3) dialog: It’s the perfect cover. Since Uncle Rudi lives in Athens, it’s only natural that you would pay hima visit to tell him the good news, and ask him about your father.
34) 5) dialog: It’s easier than it seems, I’11l coach you through it. Gaby shakes her head.
34) 7) dialog: You can do it Gaby, I'll admit it’s a challenge, but I know you can handle it. She considers, but again she’s melting.

40) 3) dialog: That's fortuitous, Taverna Tony. I've heard it’s the best restaurant in Athens. I’1l be close by.
40) 5) dialog: It wasn’t you I was thinking of, Kalinka. I'll be there anyway. A man has to eat and I like a sun- dried octopus. Kuryakin finishes knotting his tie, and puts on his jacke Once again, the clothes should be ridiculous, but Kuryaki somehow pulls it off. SOLO (CONT’D) Do you want me to lend you a tie? Kuryakin just laughs and stands next to Gaby.
40) 7) dialog: Like a beautiful wave clipper weighed down by a very heavy anchor.

43) 10) dialog: Oh yes, you do. Now give me your gun, before it gets us all into trouble. You’ve clearly got a very short temper... threatening to pull his tongue out.
43) 13) dialog: It’‘ll happen around the next corner. It’s quiet and they’ve put the street lamp out. Remember, you're an architect, take it like a pussy. Now give me your gun. I don’t have time to argue. Kuryakin rolls his eyes and obliges.
43) 28) dialog: Everyone okay? Kuryakin groans.
43) 30) dialog: Good restraint. Your father’s watch. Nice touch.

45) 11) dialog: I’m fine. Thank you.
45) 15) dialog: I’m freelance, so to speak Mr. Skorpios. My employers are not happy with their current shippers, and they are looking to make a change, but they don’t necessarily want to advertise their intentions by sending their own executives.
45) 17) dialog: Well, if I am, I am not about to admit it to you sir. But I’m intrigued, why would the owner of a shipping company be worried about spies?
45) 19) dialog: Well then, you'll be relieved to hear that I’m not remotely interested in stealing your aerospace secrets. You’re sculptures on the other hand... I haven’t seen a Praxiteles and a Lysippus in the same room since the Christie’s sale of ‘59.

48) 3) dialog: I agree. Kuryakin gives him a look. SOLO (CONT’D) What do you think of him?

Moving through the cranes and stacks of containers, Solo looks around. There are big storage warehouses, an enormo tanker being loaded up, and at the very end, a bunker-lik building which houses Triton Aerospace. 55. This building has a high fence around it and is heavily guarded by uniformed security. Just inside is a guard tower with a spotlight, whose beam periodically rakes the front of the building. Solo is standing in the shadows, looking for the best poi of entry, when suddenly he sees another figure, also dres in black, heading towards his hiding place. Solo pulls his gun and crouches behind a crate. The figur stops exactly in the spot where Solo was concealed. Solo peeps around the edge of the crate, and sees Kuryaki also scanning the fence of the aerospace building. Kuryakin spins, wielding a vicious looking knife.

50) 3) dialog: This is my patch, pal. Go and find your own warehouse.
50) 5) dialog: Look, this is my job. I don’t need you lurking about here, setting off alarms.
50) 7) dialog: You know what, this is my last mission. All I want is for it to go nice and smooth. So... you can tag along, just don’t get in the way. In and out. No one needs to know, and we can forget about it in the morning. 56.

SOLO (CONT’D) Super-hardened boron sharpened with a parallax laser. Kuryakin shrugs, he pulls out what looks like a large pen
50) 12) dialog: What's that?
50) 14) dialog: The spotlight beam crosses that doorway every forty-seven seconds. There are two locks. One each? Kuryakin nods. He takes out a device that looks like a screwdriver, with a wire coming out of one end, attached an earpiece. Clearly, a super high-tech lock pick.
50) 16) dialog: Struggling? Kuryakin shakes his head. The light is getting closer. SOLO (CONT’D) Need some help? Closer. SOLO (CONT’D) We don’t have all night, in fact, about ten seconds. A couple more tries with the pick, then Kuryakin gives up kicks the door, breaking the lock.
51) 0) text: Solo and Kuryakin are in a narrow corridor. They hold the breath, listening to know whether the sound of the door h alerted anyone. Apparently not.
51) 1) dialog: That was one way to do it. Kuryakin shrugs.
51) 3) dialog: And we've left a trail. Since we have to work together, we should agree on an approach. And in my experience, ninety-nine percent of the time, the scalpel is more effective than the hammer. 58.
52) 0) text: Solo and Kuryakin move through the labs. They are clearly being used to manufacture high-tech electronic components rocket guidance systems and satellites, but no sign of anything to do with nuclear weaponry. Solo and Kuryakin look at each other.

52) 4) dialog: Let’s take one more pass. The sound of approaching footsteps. They duck down behind desk. A GUARD passes by, on patrol. Solo waits until he enters next room, then starts to move. Solo can see Kuryakin isn moving. SOLO (CONT’D) Shall we go?
52) 6) dialog: This isn’t the time... But Kuryakin is already going after him. 59. SOLO (CONT’D) This way, dammit! It’s like a game of grandmother's footsteps, with Kuryaki sneaking up behind the Guard who periodically senses something behind him, and turns, causing Kuryakin to hide Finally, Kuryakin gets within striking distance. Solo is shaking is head. Get on with it man. But Kuryakin goes in some strange stance, puts both hands behind his back, and whistles, the guard spins. Kuryakin slaps the man so hard it’s almost unbelievable. The man is paralysed, and just stands there frozen, while Kuryakin checks his wrist. Sol quite shocked by this action. SOLO (CONT’D) What have you done to him? He grabs the Guard’s left wrist.
52) 9) dialog: Can we go now? Solo turns to leave, and suddenly stops. He has spotted a heavy protective suit hanging on the wall. SOLO (CONT’D) What is a radiation protection suit doing hanging in an electronics lab? He looks around the immediate area. Nothing. He then flic lone light switch on the wall, and the floor starts movin under Kuryakin’s feet. 60. Kuryakin steps to one side, as a section of floor slides to reveal a hidden staircase. Solo taps his temple with the tip of his index finger.
52) 10) dialog: Scalpel.
53) 0) text: The lab is pretty much empty. There are a few cannisters what looks like some disassembled centrifuge equipment, b that’s it. Solo takes off his watch and presses a button. The watch emits a faint clicking sound. It is a Geiger counter. Kuryakin eyes his own wrist mournfully. The clicking gets louder as Solo approaches a large steel vault door, set into the wall. In the center is a combina lock. Kuryakin offers Solo the lock.
53) 2) dialog: You sure... because if you want to try.
53) 4) dialog: You stick with me kid. The lead-lined vault is empty, but the Geiger counter cli madly. 61. Suddenly, there is a terrible shrieking sound. Kuryakin immediately goes into action, heading for the stairs. The floor above them is sliding shut. Kuryakin scrambles and reaches back for Solo, pulling him out just as the ga closes. Through the glass, several SECURITY GUARDS wielding machi guns can be seen approaching. Kuryakin pulls out his gun. It’s super-cool, high-tech, a huge.
53) 6) dialog: I am alright, pal. Kuryakin pulls out a second super high-tech pistol. He opens fire with both pistols at the same time. Single shots. All deadly accurate. Solo looks for a way out. He taps Kuryakin on the shoulder. SOLO (CONT’D) Can we get out of here? He points to the window. Kuryakin nods. SOLO (CONT’D) On three... One, two, three! He grabs a chair and runs at the window. Kuryakin follows SMASH. They’re through the window in a hail of glass and bullets. 62.
