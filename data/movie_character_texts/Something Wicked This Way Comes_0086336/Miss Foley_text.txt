The SILENCE is underlined by the breathy TICK of a schoolroom clock and the SCRATCHING of two pens. We SEE TWO YOUNG BOYS sitting at their desks writing. Their names are WILL HALLOWAY and JIM NIGHTSHADE. will is as fair as Jim is dark. The only other person in the room is MISS FOLEY, the schoolmistress. She is about forty, very plain indeed, with a dress buttoning up to her neck and an expression of sadness. On the blackboard behind her, in copperplate handwriting, is the line that the boys have to write out as a punish=- ment: "We must not whisper to each other in class."
1) 1) text: We SEE Will, his paper covered with the lines, writing out the last of them. Then we SEE Jim. He is drawing on an odd sheet of paper, a cruel caricature of Miss Foley, her beaky nose, her jutting chin. As Jim finishes drawing, he HEARS a step behind him and, opening the lid of his desk a erack, slid the drawing in.

75) 13) dialog: Land sakes, who is it? Will Halloway! Jim Nightshade! My * two little whisperers. What's this? More of your tricks and mischief making?

76) 18) dialog: Oh? Will watches Jim for the next surprise. Robert stares.
76) 31) text: The small figure of Robert stands in the shadow of the porch. Jim takes a hesitant step towards him, pauses. Will stands motionless. A light goes on in an upstairs window, its beam shining directly down upon him. He stares at Robert, whowe eyes burn and flare hate. Suddenly, Robert stoops, picks up a rock and raises it, his fiery, Cooger-eyes fixed on Will's face. Will stands transfixed, terrified but unable to move. Then: In one swift movement, Robert turns and hurls the rock directly up at the lighted window. It CRASHES through the glass - and Robert is gone, vaulting lightly over the porch rail and disappearing silently into the shadows Only Will can be seen, motionless, bathed in the light from the broken window. Miss Foley appears at it, astonished, staring down at him.
