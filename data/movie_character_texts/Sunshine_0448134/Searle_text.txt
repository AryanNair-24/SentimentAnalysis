The sun is only visible as a dull orange orb surrounded b blackness. The room itself is only lit by the dull orange... «++ but in the gloom, sitting on the observation couch, facing the window, we can see a man. SEARLE - the doctor and psychiatrist of ICARUS II.

4) 3) dialog: Please re-filter the observation room portal.
4) 5) dialog: Up- «+. And the light levels dial up. The room brightens considerably. We can see SEARLE clearl now. He is the oldest crew-member - in his mid-forties. He gazes at the sun, fascinated. Though still distant, th star is much larger and closer than we have ever seen it Earth. SEARLE is as hypnotised by the sight as we were during th opening sequence.
4) 6) dialog: Icarus - how close is this to full brightness?
4) 8) dialog: (smiling) Two percent... Can you show me four percent?
4) 10) dialog: Icarus - please change filter to three point oné percent. An amazing blast of bleaching brightness fills the room. SEARLE sucks in a gasp, like a man diving into ice water.

4) 11) dialog: It's invigorating. It’s like taking a shower. In light.
4) 13) dialog: It is. You lose yourself a little.
4) 15) dialog: Actually, no. For psych-tests on deep space, I’ve run many sensory deprivation trials, testing total darkness in floatation tanks. The point about darkness is: you float in it. You and the darkness are distinct from each other because darkness is a vacuum, an absence of something, whereas we are something. SEARLE pauses.
4) 16) dialog: But total light - it envelopes you. It swallows you up. It becomes you. SEARLE laughs.
4) 17) dialog: Anyway. It’s very strange.. I recommend it. MACE is passing with his tray of food.
12) 26) dialog: Well done, Capa. That is the question.
12) 34) dialog: (quick) Yes?

12) 45) dialog: It would, of course, be absurd to alter our course to assist the crew of the Icarus One. (MORE)
12) 47) text: Silence. 24. SEARLE (cont'd) Even if we knew that some or even all of the crew still alive, their lives are entirely expendable when seen in the context of our mission. As are our own lives.
12) 49) dialog: But. There is something on the Icarus One that may be worth the detour. As you pointed out, Mace, we have a payload to deliver. ‘A’ payload, singular. And everything about the delivery and effectiveness of that payload is entirely theoretical. Simply put, we don’t know if it’s going to work. But what we do know is this. {beat) If we had two payloads, we would have two chances.
12) 51) dialog: Yes.
12) 53) dialog: Yes.
12) 55) text: It is. It’s a risk assessment. The question is, does the risk of the detour outweigh the benefits of an extra payload. MACE glances around the table. 25. CASSIE eyes are shining with tears for the crew of ICARUS ONE. HARVEY, TREY and CORAZON are with MACE. ASHER is unreadable. SEARLE is behind shades. . io CAPA is undecided. ,
12) 57) dialog: No. We won’t. Because we aren't a democracy. We're a collection of astronauts and scientists. So we will make the most informed decision available to us.

CASSIE is standing by the food dispenser, filling her tra CORAZON and HARVEY sit together, and, separated by the fo empty places, are ASHER and CAPA. CAPA watches CASSIE get her food. When she turns, she sees his gaze, and gives him a smile. It’s bright and friendly, but has a subtle blankness that not missed by CAPA. The moment is not resolved, because suddenly, abruptly, a ALARM is sounding. ICcARUS All flight crew report immediately to flight deck. A frozen beat - then suddenly everyone is jumping to thei feet and running for the door.

26) 4) dialog: (feeling around with his hands like a blind man) Do they? 48. A beat.
26) 5) dialog: (lowering his hands) C’mon guys. Just trying to lighten the mood. :

He presses the button for water - and a steady stream spi out from the tap. Then he presses one of the food dispenser buttons. Chicken. . A yellow paste oozes out of the nozzle, and coils where a plate should he. With his finger, SEARLE dips his finger into the paste an gives it a taste.

34) 2) dialog: I know. The helmet comes down over HARVEY, and SEARLE locks it do Leaving MACE. 57. SEARLE takes the helmet over to MACE. MACE looks straight into SEARLE’S eyes, meeting the gaze evenly. Something between them. Something about the fact that the both know SEARLE is going to die. And something about the power that SEARLE has over MACE a that moment - if he refuses to lock the helmet. “But neither say a word. And the helmet goes down, and SEARLE locks it into place. Int.

42) 7) dialog: I’m giving you enough time to make sufficient distance from the detonation. I think a few million miles should do it. The image is going again. The sound distorting. Before it goes completely... SEARLE . It’s true, Capa. What Pinbacker said. It’s gone.
43) 0) text: SEARLE looks at a frozen distortion of CAPA’S face. The only sound is static and solar wind. Phen the image goes completely. SEARLE is utterly alone. He looks at his digital watch. Int. I DI SEARLE sits at the flight deck. - He hits a button. A string of numbers flash up on the HUD: 57600.00 SEARLE hits another button. The string of numbers starts counting down. SEARLE sets his digital watch to match the countdown. NT. I zr ss SEARLE sits in the Mess. We see at once he has a few days beard growth. 63.

Each of its sides are MIRRORED. +--+ and each of its sides are the length of a football p SEARLE stands before it, completely dwarfed by the size. SEARLE checks his watch. The number is 00006.12 SEARLE walks up to the FISSION BOMB and presses it. He has triggered a hidden door on the smooth surface, whi opens. Inside there is only darkness. SEARLE steps inside, and the door closes behind him, returning to the featureless mirror it was before.

Then stops, and sits cross-legged on the floor. He checks his watch a last time. The countdown is at 00000.07 The last seven seconds pass. The timer runs out. --- And for a few moments, nothing happens. Then, in the middle of the chamber, directly above where SEARLE sits, a single SPARK appears in the air. It fizzes and pops, but remains in roughly the same locat moving like a firefly. Then, suddenly, the SPARK splité into TWO SPARKS. SEARLE‘S FACE - his expression is pure delight. The fizzing SPARKS double again to four... Then four to eight, then sixteen, then thirty two, sixty four... ++. and suddenly the SPARKS are multiplying with exponent speed. cur TO:
