Most striking of all, the ship is covered in mirrored pan similar to fish scales. The mirrored panels cover the entire surface of the ship, except for the window portals, and a geodesic dome situat towards the back. These portals and the dome are construc with a thick half-mirrored glass. The distances involved are so huge between the ship and t sun that it hardly seems to be moving. But as we get closer, and we see space dust and particle flash past or colliding with the huli, detonating and bur under the impact and friction, we realise that in fact th ship is travelling at an extraordinarily fast speed. On the SPACESHIP’S side is its name: ICARUS II. Ir REAT I! ROOM In the RECREATION ROOM of the ICARUS II, two men sit eith side of a small table, arms folded, their faces a picture deep thought. The first, and older, of these two men is CAPTAIN ASHER. ICARUS II is under his command. He’s a career astronaut. Implacable, calm, experienced. The younger of the two men is CAPA. CAPA is a career physicist. In contrast to ASHER, CAPA is thin, young, ner and looks unkempt. He has a couple of weeks beard-growth, and his hair is a bedraggled. Between them is a CHESS BOARD - sparse pieces, scattered. The end game. Silence. No movement from either of them. The moment is held. And held. Finally, CAPA puffs out his cheeks and expelsa loud sigh. He reaches for his KING, and tips it over. He has RESIGNED. ASHER nods.
