He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe  occupation. No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford acr the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. St keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes this new atmosphere. The house is richly decorated but with an underlying them of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishing and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face st and reverent.
