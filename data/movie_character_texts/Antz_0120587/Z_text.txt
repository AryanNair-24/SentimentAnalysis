In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z' perspective, we see: -- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of from its forehead... -- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants an pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds... -- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...

Bala sits up, coated in mud.  Z is nowhere to be seen. Because she's on top of him. PRINCESS

Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque fig (a seven year old kid) holding it.

45) 9) text: Z!  what are you doing? Z
45) 10) text: I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've got to warn the others. Z looks into Bala's eyes. Z
45) 11) text: Head for the surface, Bala.  If I don't make it, well...we'll always have Insectopia. Z kisses Bala.  Then he starts running down the tunnel towards the crowd... BALA (following him)

47) 10) text: -- and he can kill termites with his bare hands!  You're just some scrawny worker with a mental problem! Z
47) 11) text: I am Z! WORKER #1
47) 13) text: Yes he is. Weaver steps out of the crowd. Z
47) 14) text: Weaver! Weaver runs up to Z and hugs him, starting to cry. WORKERS

50) 0) text: Everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the tunnel -- AZTECA
50) 2) text: He's right!!! From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing down at them... Z
51) 0) text: The huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the workers -- as well as Z, Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the Queen -- have run to. The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides.  Water fl out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crow becoming more and more closely packed together as the wat rise around them. AZTECA
51) 3) text: Z...what can we do? Z clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then h shouts... Z
51) 4) text: Dig! The workers turn to look at him questioningly. Z
51) 7) text: Yeah.  We're too important to dig. You taught us that, Z.  You hate digging! Z (at his wits end)
51) 9) text: You heard the ant -- DIG!!! The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselve passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of dry ground. -- But they seems to be making little headway against the water as it continues to rush in... The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to this.   As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher an higher...Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...near Azteca is digging like crazy too...Z runs around, directi traffic and encouraging the workers... Z
51) 10) text: That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the center!  Go on! Nearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish. Z
51) 11) text: Your highness...time to get your hands dirty! Gingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and passes it along.  Next thing you know, she's practically crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver. The water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that... ...the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher, reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber... ...And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat, swirling around angrily. Now Z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort t can reach the top -- Z
51) 12) text: We need to form a scaffolding around this mound -- let's DO IT! The workers start to cluster around the mound, covering i forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound towards the ceiling... Z
51) 13) text: Now climb! The ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the t of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling ea other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ev higher towards the top... Where they start to dig through the very ceiling... ...as, at the bottom of the mound, Z starts to organize t hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo container... Z
51) 14) text: Okay boys -- take her up! Z slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like th plastic toy monkeys...
52) 0) text: ...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground, widening the hole...
53) 0) text: The water is rising...but almost all of the ants have escaped...Z clambers up the mound, as the scaffolding of rolls up from the bottom.... And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core the structure.  As Z hauls himself through the hole in th ceiling. The entire structure collapses into the angry waters belo which seem furious to have missed their prey...
54) 1) text: He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z! The "Z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in.  But the jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge, surrounding the workers, is FORMICA'S ARMY, circling the of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water beh them.  Formica himself appears in the front lines, with Carpenter and Mandible at his side. FORMICA
54) 2) text: Z.  I should have known.  All that work, all that preparation, come to nothing.  All because of one stinking ant. He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped worke FORMICA
54) 6) text: Folks, you may have survived that flood, but there's no way you're gonna escape from me.  I'll make you a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader Z, and you survive. This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers. FORMICA
54) 8) text: What shall it be, workers? The workers remain frightened but silent.  Z trembles, terrified. FORMICA
54) 9) text: Have it your way. As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, lone figure steps out from the crowd. Z
54) 10) text: Wait... Z stands there, shivering with fear. Z
54) 11) text: ...I'm Z. For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica' gaze. Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers. WEAVER
54) 12) text: No, I'm Z. Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering, bravely risking his life for his friend.  Then, AZTECA al steps forward. AZTECA
54) 13) text: I'm Z! Next, Bala comes forward. BALA
54) 14) text: No, I'm Z. More and more ants step forward. WORKERS
54) 15) text: I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my brother!  I've been Z for weeks now! QUEEN (regally)
54) 16) text: We are Z. Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration. ALL
54) 17) text: I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z! Z is plainly flabbergasted.  Formica is outraged.  He giv the signal. FORMICA
54) 19) text: Hey, guys! THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon. WASP
54) 21) text: Are these hooligans giving you trouble, Z? FLY
54) 22) text: Say the word, Z, and we kick their butts. The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next. Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would b bulging out of his face. FORMICA
54) 29) text: Help...help me... Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Form is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created, which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's ey a new expression crossing his features: fear. FORMICA
54) 30) text: Please...I...I can't swim...Help me... Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up agai but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long... Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks dow him. Z
54) 31) text: I thought you said that the life of one ant doesn't matter. Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to realize his error... FORMICA
54) 32) text: I guess it does...to the ant. Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up b and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia). Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, whil HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala figh her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then th ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away. Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica, carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the b he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen general. CARPENTER

55) 0) text: A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a meda the Queen.
55) 2) text: General Formica was almost unemployable.  He eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall, his belly hideously distended with honeydew. Z (V.O.)
55) 5) text: Weaver cut the defense budget in half.  Now we only have an army of five million. cut back to Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE. Z
55) 6) text: And me, I guess you could say that I lived happily ever after. Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him. Z
56) 0) text: Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS.  The children cov every horizontal surface.  They run around, cry, laugh, a tease each other.  Z looks around the room, looks back at and shrugs. Z
