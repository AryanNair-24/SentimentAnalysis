53) 6) dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's a thrill to be standin' here talking to you wonderful people. In fact, it's a thrill to be standin'. I haven't seen so many people since my last fight at Madison Square Garden. After that fight a reporter asked me, "Jake, where do you go from here?" I said, "To a hospital."
53) 9) dialog: I fought one hundred and six professional fights and none of them bums figured out how to fight me -- they kept hitting me in the head! (calls to the bar)
53) 13) dialog: Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific. The kinda girl you wanta take home to meet your father. Especially if your old man's a degenerate! -- Here's a toast! "To your health! You only live once. But if you play it right, once is enough." I shouldn't be drinkin' like this 'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight. I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm allowed to eat anything I want. As long as I don't swallow it! Well, I never had much luck with my weight. In fact, -- I never had much luck with anything -- until about a few years ago, when this happened --
53) 16) dialog: ... thanks, I'm glad to see you remember. For those of you that don't... that's me takin' the title from Cerdan. You know, the tough thing about winnin' the title... the next thing you gotta do is have a rematch... just to show it wasn't no fluke. So what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a really great champ, after I beat him... he gets himself killed in that airplane crash... a pretty rotten break for him. That's why I don't like to fly. People say to me, "Look, Jake, when your time is up, your time is up." And I say, "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane and the pilot's time is up?" As good as Cerdan was, I could've taken him again. But I never got the chance to prove it wasn't no fluke. He got killed but he got to be what they call a legend. I don't know what's worse -- bein' a fluke or bein' a legend. -- That's the kinda luck I got. That's why I quit the ring and moved down here from New York. My wife said, "You gotta get outa this town, Jake." Come to think of it... the boxing commission said the same thing! But I don't miss New York. Give me Miami any day.
53) 19) dialog: Miami's a great place. I get along with everybody in this town... even the police force... They got the best cops here money can buy! -- Only kiddin'. By the way... me and my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to celibrate our eleventh wedding anniversary.
53) 22) dialog: We get along real great. We fight a little but I never really belted her on purpose. Once  in a while I'm standin' there doin' little shadow-boxin' and she happens to walk right into the shadow... I can't help that. She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?" I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a love tap." She says, "It's a good thing you're not crazy about me!" -- I am crazy about her. I heard her talkin' to a friend on the phone and she was sayin', "After eleven years, I'm still in love with the same guy." -- If I ever find out who the bum is, I'll kill him! Women. You can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em.
53) 25) dialog: "'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy. It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock the meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss who, certain of his fate, loves not his woronger; But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er who dotes, yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly loves!" -- That's from somethin' called "Othello" --
53) 29) dialog: Is whispering nothing? Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses? Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career of laughter with a sign? -- A note infallible of breaking honesty -- horsing foot on foot? Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon, midnight? and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, that would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing? Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, if this be nothing." -- That's from something called "The Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You all remember Shakespeare. He wrote all them famous plays one after the other, then he went into a big slump and he ain't done anything good in years. That speech is about jealousy -- jealousy's a bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot of guys... take me... I almost killed my brother... I love him... he's my family... I mean, there's nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And that's the way we been goin' thru life -- doin' nothin' for each other! Anytime he got in trouble when we was kids, I got him out of it. You know, he used to steal little things when we was growin' up. But he was particular... only stole things that begin with an 'a' -- a watch, a car, a suit, a ring... But I was wrong... I shoulda never hit my brother. Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every time I need somethin' I gotta go shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist once told me, "When you hit your brother you're really hittin' your mother, but you can't admit it to yourself." He's really crazy. I woulda never hit my mother. I mean, only in self-defense!

77) 4) dialog: So there I am in the can... and not the one that says "gentlemen" on the door. I'm talkin' about jail! Down south! I mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country. And if you're a guy like me, you ain't got a chance in a place like that. Especially if you're Italian... you come from the Bronx... and you're an ex-champ. As soon as they saw me... soon as they heard me... I know I'm in trouble. To me, they got an accent, and to them, I got an accent! You gotta get the picture -- I'm big, I got small hands, I walk like I'm still in the ring... the balls of my feet pop up and down, you know... and whenever I get the chance, I read a lot. So naturally, takin' all this into sideration, they figure it adds up to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I didn't mind too much when they called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one day these screws got to me... I was workin' on the work gang, pickin' up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin' and puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a sudden... one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree across my chest! This screw walks over, takin' his time, he looks down at me and says, "Well, Champ Pimp... you lyin' down on the job again?"! They got a great sense of humor when they're standin' there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest! So I look up at him and say, "Oh, this tree... it fell on me." And he says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have known, I would've yelled 'timber'" I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I think maybe I broke somethin'!" He says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then I got as stupid as him. I said, "If I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin' me the money you made last night?"! Then another screw comes over and says, "This Yankee creep givin' you trouble?" -- What kind of trouble? What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with the tree? Now anybody else in their right mind would've said, "No sir, I wouldn't think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble... I just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as I can." That's anybody else. When I said it... it was a little different. "You stupid cracker... take your hands off me or I'll get up and kick your brains out -- but first you gotta bend over so I can find 'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the hole. Solitary confinement. All my life I had guys in my corner yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill 'em! You're the greatest." Now there's nobody rootin' for me. But it wasn't so bad. I learned things there. I learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall. I never knew how to do that before. Now I know. Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is two scratches. Wednesday is three scratches. And so on. Except for Sundays. Sundays is no scratches. Sundays rested.

Some guys weren't that lucky... like the one Marlon Brando played in "On the Waterfront" -- an up and comer who's now a down and outer.

You 'member that night in the Garden you came down my dressing room and said. 'Kid, this ain't your night. We're going for the price on Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This ain't your night!' My night -- I coulda taken Wilson apart! So what happens? He gets the title shot outdoors on the ballpark, and what do I get? A one-way ticket to Palookaville. I never was no good after that night. It was like a peak you reach. Then it went downhill. It was you, Charlie. You was my brother, Charlie. You shoulda looked out for me a little bit. You shoulda taken care of me just a little bit so I wouldn't have to take them dives for the short end money... You don't understand! I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody -- instead of a bum, which is what I am. Let's face it. It was you, Charlie."
