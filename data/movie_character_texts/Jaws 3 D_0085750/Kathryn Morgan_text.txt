2) 22) dialog: Go where?
2) 24) dialog: Nobody told me.
2) 26) dialog: They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.

2) 30) dialog: That macho pompous English --
2) 32) dialog: My imagination isn't that good.

2) 38) dialog: Make this quick! She turns to her dolphins.
3) 29) dialog: It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.

3) 35) dialog: I told you, something's upset them.

3) 50) dialog: ... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
3) 52) dialog: I don't like what he does.
3) 54) dialog: He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
3) 56) dialog: I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
3) 58) dialog: No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.

12) 3) dialog: It's romantic down here.
12) 5) dialog: You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
12) 10) dialog: Now I'm getting paranoid!
14) 0) text: Kathryn works the controls, but the sub starts SINKING!
14) 3) dialog: Nothing. She's flicking all the switches.  The sub hits the bottom hard.  He watches her try the controls again.
14) 5) dialog: ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
14) 7) dialog: That we swim.
14) 10) dialog: Michael, the sub's dead.
14) 12) dialog: Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you. She gets ready to leave.
14) 14) dialog: Up.
14) 16) dialog: (getting impatient)
14) 19) dialog: I talked you into this?

16) 2) dialog: You all right?

16) 5) dialog: Michael...
16) 9) dialog: How the hell did it get in here?

17) 7) dialog: I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
17) 10) dialog: No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
17) 12) dialog: (confidently)
17) 15) dialog: I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
17) 17) dialog: No!
17) 20) dialog: Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
17) 22) dialog: It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
17) 24) dialog: The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
17) 26) dialog: I will.
17) 28) dialog: Like hell!
17) 32) dialog: (to Calvin)
17) 36) dialog: No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
17) 38) dialog: I want that shark alive.
17) 42) dialog: Yes.
17) 44) dialog: I know I can capture it.
18) 22) dialog: Well, how do I look? He turns.

18) 30) dialog: What's that?
18) 32) dialog: Fine piece of engineering.
18) 34) dialog: Thank you. She kisses him.  He takes her in his arms.
18) 36) dialog: Yes? He looks at her.  Wants to tell her to take that damn suit off.  To get off this boat and forget the fucking shark.  To go home with him, to bed.
18) 38) dialog: Love you too. Mike nods and takes his beeper.
19) 8) dialog: It's easier to lure sharks at night.
19) 13) dialog: You look like an orange worm.

19) 18) dialog: We're taking that shark alive!
19) 20) dialog: I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
19) 22) dialog: Because I don't trust you, that's why.
19) 25) dialog: I insist you get rid of that bomb.
19) 27) dialog: You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
20) 9) dialog: No.
20) 11) dialog: No, you're not. Mike pulls her face mask down and "kisses" her over it.  She goes over the side.
20) 15) text: Kathryn and Philip and Ike all start kicking down.
20) 21) text: As the three kick downward.  Philip and Ike prepare to film.  Kathryn notices Philip checking his power- head and reacts sharply.  He notices and gives her a mocking salute, making her angrier yet.  Turning, she starts toward the circling shark.
20) 24) dialog: Michael! Mike and Shelly rush there, reach down, and grab her hands to haul her up.  As they do, the shark comes after her.  They yank her over the railing an instant before it lunges out of the water and almost bites her feet off, jaws slamming shut in close shot as it misses, its body crashing back into the water. Kathryn looks at Mike, her face decidedly pale.  She attempts to smile.
20) 25) dialog: (meekly)
20) 28) dialog: ... Me, too. Her legs go watery, and she leans against the railing. Mike embraces her.
21) 3) dialog: Sounds wonderful.
21) 6) dialog: Don't be afraid, it's okay now. The dolphins don't believe her.  They dive for safety.

22) 23) dialog: Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
22) 25) dialog: Somebody could have gotten hurt.
22) 27) dialog: You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
22) 29) dialog: Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
22) 31) dialog: We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
22) 33) dialog: I think that you and I are natural enemies.
22) 36) dialog: Get ready to go.
22) 38) dialog: (calls)

25) 7) dialog: Mike! He turns and she skips up to him.
25) 8) dialog: (continuing)
25) 11) dialog: I need more pressure in the shark tank.
25) 13) dialog: I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
25) 15) dialog: No, we'll go through here.
25) 17) dialog: Yes.  It's faster. MIKE
25) 19) dialog: Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
25) 21) dialog: They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
25) 23) dialog: Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on! She takes his hand and leads him into the tunnel.
25) 25) dialog: Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
25) 27) dialog: It's too soon to move him.
25) 29) dialog: I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
25) 31) dialog: Mike... you okay? He's taking deep breaths.  He's very pale and perspiring.
25) 33) dialog: What's back? He's fighting some inner demon, and losing.  The sharks come swimming by him.  He stares them in the eye.  There seems to be thousands of them.
25) 34) dialog: Honey, what is it?
25) 36) dialog: Michael, take deep breaths.
25) 38) dialog: Come on.

27) 1) dialog: Bursts through onto the floor, kicking her shoes off on the run.  She jumps into the tank.
27) 2) dialog: When did this happen?
27) 5) dialog: Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him! Brian scampers out of the tank for the hose.
27) 6) dialog: I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
27) 8) dialog: I should have never listened to Calvin. They walk the shark.
27) 10) dialog: ... Goddamn it. The shark is dead.  It floats over, belly up.
27) 11) dialog: Takes a painful moment, looking at the shark.
27) 13) dialog: Not good enough.

29) 63) dialog: This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
29) 67) dialog: That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
29) 69) dialog: Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
31) 2) dialog: That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
33) 4) dialog: Somebody better get down there!
33) 7) dialog: How'd it get in here?!
