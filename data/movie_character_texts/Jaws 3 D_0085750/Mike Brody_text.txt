1) 60) dialog: What is it, 97 days?
1) 63) dialog: Hope I make it through both.
1) 65) text: You will.  I'll see to it. Mike points to the nervous, chittering dolphins.
1) 66) dialog: Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
1) 68) dialog: Pre-opening jitters.
1) 70) dialog: Brody here.
2) 1) dialog: What kind of trouble?
2) 3) dialog: That's impossible.
2) 5) dialog: Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.

2) 16) dialog: Hey. Mike comes over to them.
2) 17) dialog: Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
2) 19) dialog: Yeah, well I didn't!
2) 31) dialog: Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
2) 33) dialog: Honey, I gotta go.
2) 35) dialog: Make sure you put this back.
3) 11) dialog: What happened?
3) 13) dialog: Give me the walkie. Singer does.  Mike talks into it.
3) 14) dialog: Overman!
3) 16) dialog: No, Overman.
3) 20) dialog: Yeah, but you don't.  Get to work.
3) 25) dialog: Stay on top of it.
3) 44) dialog: (smiling)
3) 47) dialog: How come?
3) 49) dialog: And what else is bothering you?
3) 51) dialog: Yeah, you really don't like him.
3) 53) dialog: It's his work.
3) 55) dialog: Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
3) 57) dialog: Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
3) 59) dialog: Not enough loving.
3) 61) dialog: We'll have sushi. She smiles and shakes her head.
4) 1) dialog: Sean!
4) 3) dialog: Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
4) 5) dialog: Look great, don't I?
4) 7) dialog: Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
4) 10) dialog: (reassuringly)
4) 14) dialog: How'd you do in school?
4) 16) dialog: Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
4) 20) dialog: He needs a haircut.
4) 23) dialog: How is he?  Still fighting crime?
4) 25) dialog: (laughing)
4) 28) dialog: (appreciating)
4) 29) text: That's Dad... Mike throws an arm around Sean and hugs him.
4) 30) dialog: He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
4) 32) dialog: Gee, it's good to see you!
4) 34) dialog: Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea. They laugh.

5) 3) dialog: Sure.
5) 5) dialog: (harassed)
5) 7) dialog: Kelly, this is my brother Sean. Don't let him get lost. Mike heads for the phones in the b.g. as Sean and Kelly study each other, liking what they see.
5) 30) dialog: Come on, let's go.
5) 32) dialog: You know Overman?
5) 34) dialog: He's missing.
6) 0) text: Mike and Sean and Kelly walk to the parking lot.
6) 1) dialog: Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
6) 3) dialog: Thanks.
6) 15) dialog: Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
7) 0) text: Mike's there with Harris and Calvin.
7) 1) dialog: Why didn't you stay with him? You never let a diver go down alone!
7) 5) dialog: I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
7) 9) dialog: I'll need more men to look.
7) 11) dialog: We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
7) 18) dialog: They're coming with us?
7) 20) dialog: (skeptically)
7) 23) dialog: I don't have a choice. She understands.
7) 25) dialog: How many coupons is this ride?
8) 1) dialog: What do I do now?
8) 3) dialog: That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
10) 1) dialog: Watching through his mask as the water surrounds him. The claustrophobia sets in.
11) 0) text: Mike looks very apprehensive, and Kathryn knows it. He holds on tight.
11) 2) dialog: No.
11) 4) dialog: Yes. They settle into the water. SUDDENLY, from NO PLACE
11) 6) dialog: (reacting)
11) 10) dialog: Baby goddamn scared me to death!
11) 12) dialog: (low, to himself)
11) 14) dialog: Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
11) 16) dialog: I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
12) 4) dialog: Oh, yeah.  Very.
12) 6) dialog: Let's not talk about that now, okay?
14) 1) dialog: (apprehensive)
14) 4) dialog: ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
14) 6) dialog: You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
14) 8) dialog: (aghast)
14) 11) dialog: Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
14) 13) dialog: Where are you going?
14) 15) dialog: And leave me down here???
14) 18) dialog: What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
14) 20) dialog: I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
14) 22) dialog: No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me? They start to evacuate.
14) 23) dialog: (continuing)

15) 4) dialog: Utter fear, his eyes terrified as he stares at the shark.
16) 0) text: The dolphins carry Mike and Kathryn through the narrow opening.  The instant they are inside, the Great White hurtles into FRAME and BANGS against the gate sides, too big to get through.
16) 3) dialog: I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
16) 6) dialog: It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
16) 8) dialog: Thanks, guys. The dolphins almost answer "that's okay, but watch it next time."  Mike helps Kathryn to her feet, and they walk away, arms around each other.
16) 10) dialog: God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
16) 12) dialog: It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
17) 0) text: Calvin's called an emergency meeting.  Mike, Kathryn, Philip.  Calvin's eating his dinner through SCENE. Ike and Shelly stand in b.g.  There's a heated discussion.
17) 2) dialog: And a missing man.
17) 41) dialog: You're going down there again?
17) 43) dialog: After what happened to us?
17) 45) dialog: Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
18) 14) dialog: No.
18) 16) dialog: She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
18) 18) dialog: How many sharks have you killed?
18) 23) dialog: What?
18) 26) dialog: Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
18) 29) dialog: Here.
18) 31) dialog: Bracelets. It's what he's been welding.  Forearm protectors which he places on her.
18) 33) dialog: Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
18) 35) dialog: Kathryn...
18) 37) dialog: ... I love you. She smiles.
18) 39) dialog: Okay, hit it.
19) 1) dialog: Let us know as soon as you have anything.
19) 7) dialog: Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
19) 9) dialog: Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
19) 12) text: ... even steel. Mike looks again at her protective suit.  She looks at Philip.
19) 23) dialog: You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
19) 29) dialog: Hutton! He stops.  Turns.
19) 30) dialog: You heard the lady.  Take it off. Tense pause.  Philip stares at Mike.  At Kathryn. Then his hand moves to the grenade.  He unclips it, holds it in his hand, and
20) 3) dialog: All right, hit those lights too.
20) 8) dialog: Change your mind?
20) 10) dialog: You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
20) 14) dialog: Here.  Don't let anything happen to her. Philip smiles and nods, clips the grenade to his waist and dives, taking us
20) 18) dialog: This is ridiculous.  We should blow the mother's head off.
20) 27) dialog: I can use a shot of what he's got.
21) 2) dialog: After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
21) 4) dialog: We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water. She kisses him and turns at a familiar SOUND.
21) 10) dialog: You want me to stay?
21) 13) dialog: (remembering)
21) 14) text: Sean, that's right... Mike turns to leave, accidentally crossing in front of Philip's shot.
21) 16) dialog: Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark? He walks out. Kathryn hurries into the tank with Brian and Ruth. They unfasten the shark from the litter and start to walk it.  The litter is raised back up.
21) 21) dialog: Sean.  Sean, where are you?
21) 24) dialog: Sean?  You there? Kelly gets to her feet, pulling Sean up too.
23) 0) text: Kathryn comes quietly in.  Starts undressing in the dark.  Mike softly speaks to her from the bed.
23) 1) dialog: All well in the Kingdom of the Sea? She smiles and sits on the bed.
23) 3) dialog: How's your patient?
23) 5) dialog: Me, too. She falls into his arms, and they kiss.
23) 7) dialog: (smiling)
25) 0) text: Mike and BOB talk.
25) 2) dialog: Did you look in the intake passage?
25) 4) dialog: Well, I don't know.  Maybe he isn't down there.  Keep checking with everyone who knows him. I'll be at my office. He leaves.
25) 10) dialog: What's up?
25) 12) dialog: Okay.
25) 14) dialog: Sure.  Let's go. She stops him.
25) 16) dialog: ... Mean through the tubes?
25) 20) dialog: I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
25) 22) dialog: I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
25) 26) dialog: ... He ought to put him in here.
25) 28) dialog: So tell Calvin.
25) 30) dialog: Well, that's why you got it. They walk on a bit, then Mike leans against the tunnel wall, eyes closed.
25) 32) dialog: It's back... She goes to him.
25) 35) dialog: Hydrophobia...
25) 37) dialog: I have to get out of here.
25) 39) dialog: I can't take water, Kathryn.
25) 41) dialog: I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it! He RUNS out of there, running for his life, leaving her behind.  She watches him go.
27) 32) dialog: It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
27) 34) dialog: This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
27) 36) dialog: Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
27) 39) dialog: It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
27) 41) dialog: She still talking to you?
27) 43) dialog: Sure.
27) 45) dialog: Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
27) 51) dialog: How you doing, Kelly?
27) 54) dialog: Better than catching Sean's herpes. An astounded glare.
27) 57) dialog: (leaving)
27) 58) text: See you tonight. Mike smirks away as Kelly grabs Sean.
29) 27) dialog: Yeah, poor bastard.
29) 29) dialog: Hey, I don't want to hear.
29) 31) dialog: Buzz off.
29) 33) dialog: Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
29) 36) dialog: So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
29) 38) dialog: What the hell's there?
29) 40) dialog: Polar bears in Georgia???
29) 42) dialog: Oh...
29) 44) dialog: How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
29) 46) dialog: Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
29) 48) dialog: I'll remember that, my Lordship.
29) 53) dialog: Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
29) 55) dialog: So?
29) 59) dialog: (confused)
29) 62) dialog: What do you mean, we don't?
29) 64) dialog: Thirty feet???
29) 66) dialog: That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
29) 68) dialog: I don't understand. His BEEPER starts signaling.  He ignores it.
29) 71) dialog: I don't know...  I can't think offhand of one. He reaches for his signaling beeper.
29) 72) dialog: Yeah, what is it?
30) 4) dialog: Switch to intake three and keep it there.
31) 1) dialog: What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
31) 3) dialog: (to Philip)
31) 6) dialog: (solemnly)
33) 2) dialog: Five hundred yards.
33) 5) dialog: It's all controlled from the Control Room.
33) 8) dialog: Slumps on his stool, head in his hands, half-bagged, mumbling low.
33) 9) dialog: Oh, no... not again.  A thirty- five-foot fuckin' shark... Goddamn... what's wrong with my family?  First my father... now me...
33) 10) dialog: Sees something REFLECTED in his glass.  He leans forward, curiously, watching whatever it is growing larger and larger.
33) 11) dialog: What the hell... He turns and SEES
33) 17) dialog: Come on!
34) 0) text: Mike and Philip come jumping into Mike's golf cart.
34) 1) dialog: Watch it!  Out of the way! The tourists look at them.  Who are these rude men?
34) 2) dialog: Coming through, please! Philip is standing and screaming.
34) 4) dialog: This is Brody, get the skiers out of the water!  We got a shark loose!  A Great White!
35) 8) dialog: Shark!  Shark! But his warning is drowned out by the participating audience caught up in the show.
35) 10) dialog: Get them in!  There's a shark out there!
35) 12) dialog: Get them out of the water!
35) 23) dialog: (into microphone)

38) 0) text: Lies in bed with tubes sticking out of him.  Mike stands looking at his still brother.
38) 2) dialog: ... Kelly? Kathryn barely shakes her head "no."  Mike shows his pain.
38) 4) dialog: Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
38) 6) dialog: ... Okay. She kisses his cheek and leaves.  Mike just keeps looking at his brother.
39) 8) dialog: We net it... They all look to see
39) 9) dialog: Coming through the door, joining them.
39) 10) dialog: (continuing)
39) 14) dialog: It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
39) 17) dialog: That's right.
39) 19) dialog: Me.
39) 21) dialog: I am.  You're not.
39) 23) dialog: (cutting her off)
39) 26) dialog: No way.
39) 28) dialog: I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want. He starts for the door as Kathryn grabs him.
39) 30) dialog: I want that shark, Kathryn.
39) 32) dialog: Only to myself. She watches as he leaves.
39) 36) dialog: In diving suit, overseeing the operation.  He moves about, hand signaling the crane operator to lower the net.
39) 38) dialog: Is with Bob, ready to go in.  He holds Kathryn.
39) 40) dialog: Don't worry.  I've handled sharks before. A quick kiss and he goes into the water.  Kathryn watches.

39) 48) dialog: Welding hook eyes to tunnel mouth.
39) 49) text: Mike is intense and worried as he welds.  ANGLE DOWN, the shark's tail is swishing, more agitated.
39) 53) text: Mike and Bob move the assembly toward the tunnel mouth.
39) 58) text: Mike joins Bob. 259        CLOSE on SHIVES Being attached.

39) 79) dialog: On the walkie-talkie.
39) 80) dialog: Turn off the water.
39) 89) dialog: Turns to his crew.  Speaks into the walkie-talkie.
39) 90) dialog: It's coming out.  Get ready.
39) 103) dialog: Acts at once, speaking into the walkie-talkie.
39) 104) dialog: Pull up the rear net lines!
39) 107) dialog: Gives a new order.

39) 156) dialog: Suddenly yanked upside-down and out of the tangled flippe as the shark, on its kill run, lunges where Mike had been moments before.
39) 157) dialog: Is bumped hard by the passing shark.
39) 158) dialog: Swims down as the shark, overhead, turns.
39) 160) dialog: Perplexed, looks for way out.  Begins to swim down.
39) 162) dialog: Looks over his shoulder at the pursuing shark.  It's gaining fast.  Mike's kicking as fast as he can.
39) 164) dialog: Swims frantically, the cave seeming so close yet so far.
39) 166) dialog: At mouth of cave, desperately reaching for the lip. He swings into the cave... and out of the shark's path as
39) 168) dialog: Reacts to the close call.
39) 170) dialog: His face reflecting concern as light changes and there is a
39) 192) dialog: Trapped in the cave.  He hears the O.S. SOUND of the sub and looks out, trying to see.
40) 2) dialog: Pushing to one side to avoid the concrete piece the sub is pushing in.
40) 8) dialog: Pressed against the cave wall, is almost touched by the concrete piece.  Now there is room enough for him to get out.
40) 9) dialog: Starts to push out through the cave opening.  CAMERA ZOOMS IN on his face as he sees --
47) 0) text: Points toward the galleon.  Mike hesitates, then sees that they have no other chance and they slide back the canopy quickly, push out of the sinking sub, and swim toward the galleon.  The dolphins suddenly appear in FRAME, and Mike and Kathryn grab their fins, looking around to see where the shark is, reacting as they see
48) 0) text: Mike and Kathryn swimming downward toward CAMERA. They kick into the dark hold, CAMERA pulling down from them, stopping.  They swim past CAMERA and, in the next moment, the berserk shark appears, trying to follow them into the hold.  It can't get through, the opening too small, but shatters part of the framing.
49) 0) text: As Mike and Kathryn push out through the opening and kick up with extreme caution.
49) 10) text: The dolphins diving with Mike and Kathryn as they put their mouthpieces back in.  We see that they are outside the Control Room, the men inside looking out at them in shock.  Mike lets go of the fin and swims to the lock, gesturing for Kathryn to do the same.  She does and both take refuge in the concrete recess as the shark zooms into FRAME from behind CAMERA, rushing at them.
50) 0) text: The shark still trying to get at them.  Mike shuts the outer door and starts to drain the water from the lock. As it comes below their heads, they pull out their mouthpieces and look at each other with dazed relief. He puts his arms around her, and they lean their fore- heads together, breathing hard.  The water is out of the lock in seconds;  inside, men activate the inner door
51) 0) text: As Mike and Kathryn are helped in by the technicians. One of them looks toward the o.s. window suddenly.

51) 18) dialog: Times his move perfectly and KNOCKS the grenade out of Philip's locked fist.  The grenade comes to rest between the shark's TEETH.  Kathryn gives Mike some air, then
51) 19) dialog: Leaps forward and SNATCHES the grenade out of the shark's mouth.
51) 20) dialog: Hurriedly wraps a metal strip around the grenade.
51) 22) dialog: PULLS the grenade pin and
