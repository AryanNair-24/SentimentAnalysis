Though her battered and sim clothes suggest poverty, there's strength and intelligenc apparent in her. Also wildness and a fierce beauty. She looks over Brendan... and his simple possessions.

21) 9) dialog: Celt. A priest.
21) 11) dialog: (sardonic) By knowing. Y'ever leave this land, you might know things too. (looks over Brendan) Needs mostly water... maybe fruit.

51) 2) dialog: You a herd dog? Beowulf, momentarily thrown, struggles up a grin.
51) 4) dialog: Yes. The much-told hero from Geatland. In their glances there's obvious attraction, but both are cautious in the manner, reluctant to appear drawn. Selma turns back to her work. Beowulf edges closer.
51) 6) dialog: No. I came here in my teens. (pointed) A whore to Unferth's uncle, Alvis Three-Legs. (beat) Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it was One. (off his look) Leg. Beowulf lets her grim quip have its moment.

51) 24) dialog: By Grid, you're the lamest blood- mighty I've met! (off his look / beat) The death of the troll will cost dear both the Geats and Danes... as it bloody well should.
51) 26) dialog: The Danes have done their doom on him. And you come here to kill.
51) 28) dialog: I'm not a killer. Beowulf grabs hold of her arm, his anger rising. But she stares back at him, gives no physical resistance, only he eye.
51) 30) dialog: Oh so you're a soft-heart too. Beowulf catches himself, releases her arm, and steps back
51) 31) dialog: Some men end up torn to bits. And eaten. Their heads used for bowling. Beowulf scowls, thrown by the weirdness of her warning.
51) 35) dialog: Rolling a ball against standing cups... or - I dunno - skulls? The Saxons play it. But you're just a worm-eaten northern shit... so I guess you wouldn't know.

51) 37) dialog: Careful with what you don't understand. Beowulf turns, eyes her a beat, then continues on with hi boys. Once out of Selma's earshot, Hondscioh catches Breca's ey grins.

63) 12) dialog: And what if I lie?
63) 14) dialog: So. No thoughts at all for my cunt. Beowulf looks off: it's not the word he needs to hear rig now.
63) 15) dialog: Warrior-monk, not many of those. She studies him a beat, then turns and she goes into her

64) 1) dialog: The answer's in the stones, not my breasts. She looks up at him. He awkwardly shrugs - caught. There comes agitation from the HORSES outside, STOMPING t dirt, NEIGHING. An eerie WHISTLING. Beowulf stands, and draws his sword. He eyes her a beat. She looks back down to her stones. And he strides out...
66) 0) text: Beowulf rides along, though cautiously, due to the mist. Shapes can be vaguely made out... suggestions of movement but they're unresolved, indefinite - keeping Beowulf on h guard. There comes a weird unsettling LAUGH... then the sound of FALLING SCREE to one side... --.and Beowulf veers off the trail... -..coming to a slope which leads up to a more sheer rock- face. At his feet, dust from the stone-fall is only start to settle. Selma rides up beside him. Beowulf gives her a wary look.
66) 2) dialog: That's less than wise.
66) 4) dialog: They don't need to. Most could see... to climb shifting scree at dusk... in mist... unless of course you're a hero... Beowulf stares up into the mist. (CONTINUED)
66) 9) dialog: It's Grendel. Not Grannel.
66) 11) dialog: Well it isn't barking. A low rumble of a garbled MUTTER [in Old Norse/Icelandic] from above. Selma smirks.
66) 13) dialog: He offers you the same. (off his look) You can leave or meet your doom. (beat) You're not Dane. That's why you still breathe. WITH: Grendel...
66) 18) dialog: Says that's your burden. Beowulf's temper frays, he raises his sword at the rock-f
66) 21) dialog: He says that might help. He's had a hard time shitting since the last Dane he ate. The sound of shifting scree... and Beowulf raises his sword... eyeing the mist for a discernible shape. But nothing comes. A silence.

67) 6) dialog: I'm Dane. I'm at peace. Not that I always was. (beat) When Alvis Three-Legs died in my bed, some - like Unferth - claimed * I killed him with a drink. They burned my hut, drove me to the wilds. Then they'd only come around to maybe spill some seed.

67) 14) dialog: of teeth. He was born with bad dreams. Beowulf gives a skeptical look. Selma shrugs: believe it not. * (CONTINUED)
67) 17) dialog: Nothing I say will help you kill him. Beowulf studies her - sees the challenge - and her witchy beauty in the falling light.
67) 18) dialog: Keep to the path. Try not to fight with the moss. Selma crosses the threshold into the hut, lights a lamp, takes off her cloak. She turns in the doorway and her breasts shift noticeably beneath the worn-thin cloth of h blouse. She stares back at Beowulf a beat, then closes th door. The sound of a WOODEN LATCH falling into place. Beowulf, both stunned and aroused, turns and mounts his horse, eyes the falling dark.

86) 5) dialog: Unless your teeth can catch an axe... Beowulf softens his manner.
86) 7) dialog: You found the cave. (beat / hesitant) That's where I see him... dying.
86) 9) dialog: Would you sit in your cave and wait for killers who knew the path to your door? A silence. Beowulf slumps back against a fish-drying rack

87) 3) dialog: Then again, heroes -- He turns on her, volatile, barely in control. She almost snarls:
87) 4) dialog: You hit me, I'll be the one -- She stops herself, but Beowulf's heard enough to wonder.
87) 8) dialog: I can't stop his death from coming... nor can I hurry it.

107) 8) dialog: Hondscioh. (off his nod) And one Geat life's worth - what? - two Danes...? Three Swedes...? Ten trolls? (off Beowulf's stare) Hondscioh's life had worth to you, since you knew him. Others know others. A long beat. A realization comes to Beowulf.
107) 10) dialog: I knew him. As she stirs her fire...
108) 1) dialog: We'd all heard tales when we were kids... later, we learned that most were told to keep us out of streams in the spring... or clear of icebergs when they were calving. The wilds were harsh, you could wander lost for days... so they told us trolls lived there... (beat) ...but they did. A shape in the middle distance abruptly turns, rises: it' Grendel.

112) 0) text: Selma is placing sticks on the fire. She glances up at Beowulf.
112) 1) dialog: Thing is, he never took me again.
112) 3) dialog: Keep the Danes away. The ones who'd fuck me then cut my throat.
112) 5) dialog: They're mostly gone now.
112) 7) dialog: Yes. Some of Hrothgar's best. (CONTINUED)
112) 11) dialog: You thinking you can tie me up and drag me like a dog. (beat) Don't forget. I know how you die. Beowulf is jolted. Almost as much as when she rises up to him and kisses him - hard. They tentatively reach for each other. She abruptly pulls him to her, driving her face along the sides of his throat, feeling his hair against her cheek. He kisses her face and she swings her mouth to his - kiss him hungrily. As their hands explore each other's bodies... Selma works her way across his chest - the first time she had this control in years - if ever at all.
112) 13) dialog: With men... yeah. Beowulf gets it like the slap. She laughs. She steers him back onto a bench, then raises her skirt a straddles his lap. He kisses back - finally getting the picture - and they t into each other... fiercely, rather like animals.

129) 3) dialog: It's not me who does it. A chill runs through Beowulf. He broods a beat.
129) 4) dialog: Anything else you need to know? (CONTINUED)
129) 8) dialog: You couldn't.
129) 10) dialog: No. You just killed his father. (beat) Hrothgar taught you nothing I guess. Beowulf considers this a bit. He moves towards her, raise hand to touch her... but she moves out of reach. She picks up a bucket and strides off across the meadow.. .--Beowulf - torn - watching her go.
