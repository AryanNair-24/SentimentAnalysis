15) 14) dialog: (closing the menu) Drive around looking for decent  restaurant.
15) 17) dialog: My reputation got us invited here. I  play by the rules. It's called  objectivity.

A muscular black man (30's) with a Mu skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck be him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits ba against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny wh guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the  building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-bang (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching th chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.

21) 15) dialog: This is Zack.
21) 21) dialog: Hello.
21) 32) text: Bitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks at the microphone. She understands, nods.
21) 38) text: They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's loo at the floor, caught in a thought.
21) 39) dialog: So...
21) 42) dialog: He's a character.
21) 44) text: David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.

21) 47) text: Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.
21) 49) dialog: All right. Anything else, just clearly  say, 'off the record.' I'll take it  to my grave. But then you know that  about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be  here.
21) 51) dialog: (referring to the pen) Is this recording equipment?
21) 54) dialog: I'd say you're a man with a story to  tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the  magazine, the format. You chose me.

47) 1) dialog: Try phone records, a net search.
47) 5) dialog: Don't ask me that. I don't know.  There is no truth, only perspectives.
47) 7) dialog: Working on our philosophy merit badge,  Zack?
47) 10) dialog: This you know telepathically?
47) 12) text: In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are i their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feel the music.

49) 0) text: Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, point out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his  eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is op by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen. She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine I Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within. The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable  silence, Bitsey extends her hand.
49) 1) dialog: Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is  Zack Stemmons. We --

50) 8) text: Zack puts his back. Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Got Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plas wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platin blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.
50) 11) dialog: Do many people take the tour?
50) 17) text: Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the vario areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly t pots with dead plants lying around. By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outli and indexed (#2).

52) 7) dialog: Right, facing her body. Are we on?

89) 4) dialog: What did you tell her?
89) 7) dialog: Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?
89) 9) dialog: Whoever got in here -- without a key  in broad daylight -- was probably  smart enough not to leave prints. I  have the remote.
89) 12) dialog: (hitting the remote) They don't look for D.N.A. when  someone breaks in to deliver, Zack.  Here.

92) 0) text: Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stac of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they  wait until she leaves. Hushed tones.
92) 2) dialog: No, it's perfect. He knows News  Magazine won't give the scoop to the  dailies or nightly news, not after  having paid for it. Probably guessed  we wouldn't call the cops. And, most  importantly, knows I'll tell Gale  tomorrow.
92) 4) dialog: Zack, what if Harraway's murder was  just a means to getting Gale. I mean  sending him through hell, a sick cat  and mouse game. You kill the one  person he has left. Make sure he  sits six years on death row for the  murder -- a place he's made a public  career of loathing. And then just  let him die, die knowing everyone  will remember him with disgust. You  destroy his loved ones, his life's  work, his memory -- and you make him  watch.
92) 6) text: Bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need-I-say-more face
92) 8) dialog: If the mouse dies the game's over.  Maybe the cat's enjoying himself.  Or...

94) 14) dialog: Can you see the license?
95) 0) text: The office has a view of the rain-soaked capital. Expensively decorated. Dark woods and deep carpets -- Belyeu's practice is clearly thriving. A sharp-looking CL sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum  suitcase. Bitsey sits on a huge sofa. Belyeu stands just  outside his door.
95) 3) dialog: I couldn't sleep afterwards.
95) 5) dialog: Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her  house.
95) 7) dialog: But it will at least get us a  postponement?
95) 13) dialog: Why?
95) 15) dialog: But someone put it in my hotel room.
95) 19) dialog: Thanks.
95) 21) dialog: (standing) Yeah.
96) 0) text: Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold "Belyeu and Crane" sign. She turns a corner. At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevat pushes the call button.

98) 7) dialog: A taxi.
100) 0) text: Bitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David. She's upset.
100) 6) dialog: Then why was he following us? Why  was he at Belyeu and Crane?
100) 8) dialog: Why?
100) 11) dialog: He would've said something.
100) 13) dialog: Maybe Dusty was jealous because you  were seeing Constance.
100) 15) dialog: She died... she had your sperm --
118) 0) text: ROTATING CAMERA. Bitsey's agitated. David's drained.
118) 1) dialog: But there has to be someone. Someone  with a motive, who knew you both.  Someone who visited that morning.
118) 3) dialog: There's not enough time.
118) 6) dialog: You know that's not what I meant.  You should have done this earlier.
118) 9) dialog: You're going to let them kill you.
118) 13) dialog: (softly) Goodbye, David.
119) 2) text: Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protes flank the drive.
119) 3) dialog: No thanks.

The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists: They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder  doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a lar black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey. The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penal activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'L Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours." At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign  leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches r its letters run.
120) 0) text: The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s) eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simpl You Kill, You Get Killed." In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinne largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALIST at a table not far from theirs.
120) 3) text: They find this hilarious. Bitsey looks away.
120) 4) dialog: What time is it?
121) 0) text: Pouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries  Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own.
121) 1) dialog: Belyeu!
121) 2) text: He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper ove her head, Zack slouches.
121) 3) dialog: Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?
121) 5) dialog: You could have said something.
121) 9) dialog: No.

127) 0) text: Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack,  stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hi her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She spits, hurries into the bedroom.
128) 1) dialog: (putting on her shoes) Zack! Wake up! Get up!
128) 3) dialog: Did you throw the towel on the floor?
128) 5) dialog: The towel on my bathroom floor. Did  you put it there?

Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the begin freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on t Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by side.
130) 18) dialog: Zoom in a hair.
130) 19) text: He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).
130) 20) dialog: Put the gloves on a dish rack.
130) 23) dialog: Turn them inside out.
130) 25) dialog: Move the tape roll about a foot to  the left. And get rid of the  handcuffs.
130) 27) dialog: Come check this, Zack. (to the Goth Girl) Could you... what's your name?
130) 29) dialog: Nico, lie down on the floor, facing  the counter.
130) 33) dialog: That's fine. Just straighten her  legs.
130) 34) text: Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape,  however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.

130) 39) dialog: I noticed this back at the hotel.  See?

130) 41) dialog: She moves her foot. Why?
130) 43) dialog: It's another fifteen seconds before  she comes to. If she had passed out  once, without fresh air she wouldn't  come back. There was no head trauma,  her blood tested normal --
130) 45) dialog: Or...
130) 46) text: Bitsey looks up at Nico.
130) 47) dialog: We've got to bag her.

130) 53) dialog: (to Zack) Okay, I want you to wait three minutes  before you take it off.
130) 55) dialog: Three full minutes. Just stand behind  the tripod. Both of you.
130) 56) text: Zack and Nico move behind the tripod. Bitsey puts the bag her head, rips off a long length of tape. She seals the b around her neck. She then handcuffs herself from behind,  with some difficulty.

130) 79) dialog: (still breathing  heavily) She... she did it herself.
130) 81) dialog: She used the gloves to keep  fingerprints off the tape and bag.  Then she put them back on the dish  rack, but upside down and inside  out, a housewives' habit. A murderer  would have just tossed them aside --  like they were the first time we  were here, like you do a towel in a  hotel.
130) 83) dialog: They threw me. I forgot you have to  have the key to put them on. But she  needed them. She knew she would  instinctively try to rip the bag  off, that at some point automatism  would kick in.
130) 85) dialog: And she swallowed the key so she  couldn't get to it. She made sure  there was no way out.
130) 87) text: A beat. Bitsey contemplates.
130) 88) dialog: It's so calculated. She's handcuffed,  taped at the mouth. The gloves. The  damn tripod.

130) 92) dialog: Thanks, Zack.
