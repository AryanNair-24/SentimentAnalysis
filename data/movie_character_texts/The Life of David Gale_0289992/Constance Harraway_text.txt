2) 2) text: The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is fille with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY w a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a compu screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs  quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding phone to one ear. The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE  (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at nothing. She bites her lip.
2) 5) dialog: David, don't start throwing things.
2) 8) text: Another PHONE RINGS. Constance stands.
2) 9) dialog: Go. I'll do it.
23) 0) text: Students pour out of the double doors leading from David' class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him agai the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes). She's looking at a document, holds a file.
25) 0) text: David comes out the room. Constance sees him, hurries to  him. She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with  absolute authority. They talk as they walk down the crowd hall.
25) 1) dialog: David!
25) 3) dialog: The T.A. finished transcribing the  Governor's radio and TV comments.  Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why  I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The  woman breathes in soundbites.
25) 6) dialog: You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff.
25) 8) dialog: Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.
25) 10) dialog: I know.
26) 0) text: David and Constance exit the building into the sun.
26) 1) dialog: She's gonna do the whole mother thing.  She empathizes with you completely,  but experience has given her the  courage to take the tougher road, ta- da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And  flirt politely.
26) 4) dialog: And watch your ego. Don't come across  as one of those I-hate-authority- because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types.
26) 6) dialog: Yeah, don't fall into one of your  brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting  new federal stats from Amnesty  tonight.
26) 9) dialog: If you have a hang-over tomorrow --
26) 11) dialog: (calling after him) Ten o'clock! (beat) Bright-eyed and bushy tailed!
42) 0) text: Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and go into her bathroom.
43) 4) dialog: Okay, let's say we find an innocent  on death row. Wouldn't matter.  Corrections would let him go. Governor  Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks  to the good people at DeathWatch,  the system works.' Yeah, if they  executed an innocent, and we had  absolute, undeniable, in-your-face  proof, we could demand abolition.  Just like happened in England. Are  you okay?
43) 7) dialog: But it hasn't happened, not since  '76. And won't happen.
43) 9) dialog: Dead men can't make a case.
43) 11) dialog: Just keep it rational. The death  penalty is expensive and ineffective.  No one wants to see a murderer as a  victim.
43) 13) dialog: And stop that.
43) 15) dialog: Active listening. I hate active  listeners. Makes me feel like I'm  with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares  more about appearing to listen than  actually listening. Did you bring  the Amnesty fax?
43) 17) dialog: I have a copy.
43) 19) dialog: You want to tell me what's up.
43) 21) dialog: (teasing) I hope you used a condom.
43) 23) dialog: Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of  yours?
43) 27) dialog: Oh, that's great, great. I can hear  the grapevine now. They suspended  her so Gale could dick her with a  clear conscience.
43) 29) dialog: A power differential equals coercion.  Great. You are so weak.
43) 31) dialog: I know you can tell yourself it's a  position I aspire to, but believe  me, I would rather...
43) 34) dialog: Let's go.
43) 37) dialog: Yes, let's just go.
44) 5) text: Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David something about the papers in front of him.
44) 10) text: Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Gov is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles wi her.
44) 12) text: The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance  bites her lip.
44) 17) text: Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Gove is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting he reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his t more sincere.
44) 19) text: David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance.
44) 21) text: Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.

45) 0) text: Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to th parking lot.
45) 1) dialog: Your exact words were, 'Just tell me  when my ego gets in the way of the  work.' Now I'm telling you: Your  ego's in the way of work.
45) 3) dialog: You put up precisely two seconds of  protest at the thought of a televised  debate.
45) 5) dialog: It means DeathWatch suffers because  you're so anxious to finger authority,  to publicly prove that David Gale is  so much fucking smarter than the  powers that be. Learn to work without  an audience. Try squeezing money  from the donor list. Have you ever  licked one single mail-out envelope?
45) 10) text: The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to exami it more closely.
45) 14) text: Constance and David look at each other, stunned.

53) 1) text: David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's  concentrated; she's biting her lip. They're looking onto large parking lot. The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase, who stand near their Jeep. It's packed with various house items, things not entrusted to movers.
53) 2) dialog: I'll drop by your office after.

He re into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his gl There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters.
55) 1) dialog: You could at least hide the bottle.
55) 4) dialog: Officially, you're on sabbatical.  Unofficially, they want you to look  for another position. It was four to  two.
55) 7) dialog: You're not supp... Against you.
55) 10) dialog: Against my politics.
65) 0) text: Constance opens the door for David. He's wearing a short  sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie. She's taken aback. Looks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh.
65) 1) dialog: I'm sorry.
66) 0) text: The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding doo is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads Davi in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. H hair is different.
66) 1) dialog: You look good.
66) 4) dialog: (lightly, in his arms) I need you. DeathWatch needs you,  now more than ever.
66) 6) dialog: Look.
66) 8) dialog: Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled.
66) 11) dialog: I've got a call with Hawkins tonight,  and if national will commit emergency  funds...
66) 15) dialog: But I'll save a life.
66) 17) dialog: Spring cleaning.
67) 1) dialog: She went up at 18, she's 26 now.
67) 6) dialog: I really want us to get behind this  one. She's articul --
67) 8) text: Constance looks at him a beat, sighs.
67) 9) dialog: A cop.
67) 13) dialog: You're mixing metaphors.
67) 15) dialog: Are we gonna do this?
70) 0) text: Constance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talkin on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national directo a social gathering is going on behind him.
70) 3) dialog: I'm sure we can get some pulpit time,  maybe cable.
70) 6) text: David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then  animatedly licks and seals it. He then, literally, pats  himself on the back.
70) 9) dialog: (to the phone) John, David's going to --
70) 11) text: Constance hesitates, looks at David. He shakes his head n
70) 12) dialog: No.
70) 14) text: Constance is not sure how to react. David just stares at  her.

73) 2) dialog: Come on, come inside.
103) 0) text: Constance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon. She's shockingly anemic. Dusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep. After a beat, she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been  fighting to stay awake. She looks at him, then sees the m in his hand. She looks away.
103) 1) dialog: All I can feel is envy.
105) 0) text: David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Blac Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing.

They  silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle he sips his drink.

105) 3) dialog: Denial.
105) 5) dialog: The whole idea of there being a  process makes me tired. I'm not up  to the job of Dying Person. Marveling  at blades of grass. Lecturing  strangers to relish every moment.
105) 7) dialog: Mending bridges. Confessing regrets.  Uuuggh.

130) 34) text: Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape,  however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.

She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer. It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to  "Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New  York 10036." A beat as she stares in disbelief.

She tears off ano small section, drops the roll on the floor. She tapes the small section over her mouth. She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes  watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the ot She seals the bag around her neck. She smoothly takes off the gloves.
