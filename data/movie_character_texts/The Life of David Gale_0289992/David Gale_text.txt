Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY w a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a compu screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs  quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding phone to one ear. The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE  (31).

21) 2) text: The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected b curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's boo is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside lo like they are in a sound booth. Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On t visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each  section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's cente is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy b This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's). On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs  trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microp hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainles steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.
21) 5) text: He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet. Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvar Yard.
21) 8) text: Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly. David stan up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch
21) 17) text: They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really  loudly) interrupts:

21) 41) text: She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smil sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.
21) 43) dialog: Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met  the summer after 4th grade, spent  the day burning ants with his dad's  magnifying glass. We called it playing  'Execution.'
21) 44) text: David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.

22) 6) text: The crowd laughs, David changes tone.
22) 7) dialog: Okay, good, you see Lucan's point.  Fantasies must be unrealistic. The  minute you get something, you don't,  you can't, want it anymore. To exist,  desire needs absent objects. So desire  supports itself with crazy  fantasies...
22) 8) text: The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a s door, out-of-breath and discombobulated. The crowd laughs the timing. David pauses.
22) 11) dialog: This is what Pascal means when he  says the only time we're truly happy  is when day-dreaming about future  happiness.
22) 13) dialog: Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter  than the kill' or 'Be careful what  you wish for.'
22) 15) dialog: Not because you'll get it, but because  you're doomed not to want it if you  do. Think about it next time you're  at a wedding.
23) 0) text: Students pour out of the double doors leading from David' class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him agai the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes). She's looking at a document, holds a file.

43) 10) dialog: And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.

44) 18) dialog: Governor, can't we examine the  possibility that capital punishment  isn't working. That murderers aren't  deterred by the law because they  have about as much forethought as  lemmings. That it's expensive,  inequably administered, that...

52) 3) dialog: Constance was murdered with what's  called the Securitat Method. You're  hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the  key, taped at the mouth, a bag's  sealed over your head and you're  left to suffocate. The Securitat did  this to Romanians who wouldn't inform  or confess. Sometimes the bag was  ripped off at the last second, you  got a second chance. If not, you die  knowing the 'key' to your freedom  was inside you the whole time. A  cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem  is I mentioned the method in an early  article. The prosecution never knew.
52) 5) dialog: It's more than that.
52) 6) dialog: There was a tripod.
52) 8) dialog: (nods agreement) Not a single print was found on it.  Someone brought it, wiped it, left  it. Why? It's as if they wanted me  to know that somewhere there's a  record of what really happened that  afternoon. As if they wanted me to  die knowing the key to my freedom  was... out there.
52) 10) dialog: Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row  activist on death row. Doesn't that  strike you as odd?
