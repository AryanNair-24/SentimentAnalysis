6) 10) dialog: What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
6) 12) dialog: Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
6) 14) text: Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...

6) 17) dialog: Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.

50) 12) dialog: He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
50) 14) dialog: He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes. Adele sits down at the other end of the table.
50) 16) dialog: He didn't want me to.
50) 18) dialog: I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.

50) 25) dialog: Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
50) 27) dialog: He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire.

Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in. (then)
50) 38) dialog: That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc. (then)
