Her face brushes against something hanging in the air. She pulls back. It' pull string hanging from a naked light bulb. She tugs on it. Nothing. No power here. She stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. Sh looks back down the hall. It seems as if she's come to another dead end. Then she stares at the bathroom door. O now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall -- the only p she hasn't looked. Amy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and push the door closed. As she does, of course, what little ligh there is, vanishes completely. If there's something behin the door, she can't see it, or anything else. Abruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- a the previously unseen space behind the door. The walls do not meet there. There is a narrow gap, leadi to a passage, apparently "between" the walls, perhaps ten inches wide.

As she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens behind her. Passing across the rusty doorknob, a menacing blade appears. Inside the tunnel, Amy reaches a vertical pipe up against side of the wall - - only a few inches thick, but it redu the available room to under eight inches. She hesitates. Meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. She le it click off. In some dim half-light we can see her slipp a handkerchief carefully around it, for insulation. She flicks the flint.

One of Amy's hands flies back and hits the wall behind her. Now she really panics, her hands desperately scraping alo the wall looking for anyway out. There isn't any. She looks back toward her attacker, who's now right on to of her and raising the knife for one final blow. Amy braces for the blade's impact as she pushes against t wall when suddenly she- Falls backward onto the floor. Her heart pounding. Her breathing heavy. She checks her arms for wounds. There aren't any. She looks up. The Figure is gone. She stands, confused, and finds herself in an empty room. Some discarded junk, a pile of loose plaster. She leaps forward, and nearly trips on a piece of rubble to get the hell away from the entry. Odd thing is...here is no entry She whips herself around towards the sound of someone sha exhaling. She looks this way and that, but can't see the source of sound. The attacker? A pale light is visible, coming from around a far corner. Someone steps into the light. A young BLACK KID.

Her eyes open, but she isn't alarmed. Still lying on her back, she flicks her eyes this way and that, but, seeing nothing, she closes them again. A few seconds later, we see some black liquid trickle acr her shoulder, coming from the unseen center of her back . follows a course down her backbone, then swerves and find path along the inner edge of one of her shoulder blades, finally trickling down her neck. It continues to flow, staining the pillow by her face. She stirs slightly, clearly feeling the trickle. She puts hand to her shoulder, smearing the black liquid. Still ha asleep, she tries to "brush" it off... but it continues t flow. Finally, her eyes open. She sits up painfully and l at her hands -- stained with this sticky black stuff. She stares at it, not quite awake enough to figure it out. She reaches over her shoulder, pulls her hand back, stain with the black stuff. She looks down at her pillow, also stained.

She stops dead, seeing something in the mirror. Something is glinting between her breasts. She touches he finger to it. It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal, poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny steel splinter. It appears to have just barely broken through t skin from "inside" -- barely a drop of blood. She stands staring down at it, breathing fast. What the h is it? Then, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back the mirror and looks over her shoulder. She sees -- and w see for the first time -- the center of her back where he questing hands couldn't reach. There is a knife there, literally thrust through the midd of her back. The gleaming splinter between her breasts is tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her -- and clearly transfixed the center of her chest -- her heart. She strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossib thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. She turns back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes. AMY

Through a large mirror at an intersection, she sees the source of the footsteps. A cop on the beat. Amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her blood. The footsteps get louder. She sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand. Sh grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover blood. It soaks threw in no time. The Cop is nearing the corner. She grabs another, then another, and throws them down. The pool of her blood leaks from under them all. Th cop rounds the corner, he has a baton he taps against his leg.
