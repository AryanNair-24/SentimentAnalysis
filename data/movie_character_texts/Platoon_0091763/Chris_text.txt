Very happy, chatting it up. They pass the newboys - and they shake their heads, their eyes full of an almost mocking pity.

They're frightening eyes, starved, hollow, sunken deep in his face, black and dangerous. The clammy pallor of malar clings to him as he looks at Chris through decayed black  teeth. Then the sun flares out on him and he's past. And  Chris looks back. Disturbed. It's as if the man was not r For a moment there. As if he were a ghost. Chris walking, duffel bag on the shoulder, looks up at th lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky. A rushing SO now.

A sweating white face comes into view. CHRIS - cutting po Machete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, 16 in the other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat  exhaustion. Breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into things, tripping, not quite falling, he look pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle. An urban  transplant, slightly neurotic and getting more so. His rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly pack pounds banging noisily. Behind him BARNES now comes, the Platoon Sergeant. Then t RTO, his radio man, humming lightly. Others are behind, t column snaking back deep into the brush. We cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen  later. Young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the fie exhausted yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn,  personalized, hair way past regulation length, medals,  bandannas. A jungle army. Boys. Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. Transfe the machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand. kid cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not even bothering to look ahead. He smells something, lo around, slows his pace, eyes working... around to the bas of a tree. He moves past it. And as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around o dead decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets, worms and flies feasting. Chris draws his breath in, terrified.

Some goddamn week, grandma... (checking his raw  blisters) ...the hardest thing I think I've  ever done is to go on point, 3 times  this week - I don't even know what  I'm doing. A gook could be standing  3 feet in front of me and I wouldn't  know it, I'm so tired. We get up at  5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4  or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then  put out an all-night ambush or a 3- man listening post in the jungle.   It's scary cause nobody tells me how  to do anything cause I'm new and  nobody cares about the new guys,  they don't even want to know your  name. The unwritten rule is a new  guy's life isn't worth as much cause  he hasn't put his time in yet - and  they say if you're gonna get killed  in the Nam it's better to get it in  the first few weeks, the logic being:  you don't suffer that much. I can  believe that... If you're lucky you  get to stay in the perimeter at night  and then you pull a 3-hour guard  shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 hours  a night, but you don't really sleep...  I don't think I can keep this up for  a year, grandma - I think I've made  a big mistake coming here...

Well here I am - anonymous all right,  with guys nobody really cares about -  they come from the end of the line,  most of 'em, small towns you never  heard of - Pulaski, Tennessee,  Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend,  Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania. Two years'  high school's about it, maybe if  they're lucky a job waiting for 'em  back in a factory, but most of 'em  got nothing, they're poor, they're  the unwanted of our society, yet  they're fighting for our society and  our freedom and what we call America,  they're the bottom of the barrel -  and they know it, maybe that's why  they call themselves 'grunts' cause  a 'grunt' can take it, can take  anything. They're the backbone of  this country, grandma, the best I've  ever seen, the heart and soul - I've  found it finally, way down here in  the mud - maybe from down here I can  start up again and be something I  can be proud of, without having to  fake it, maybe...

Past a lookout (Adams) pulling security,  hitting a joint but alert. King motions to him, it's cool Inside is another world. Chris looking around amazed. It' like a private cabaret for the 'heads' who are there cool out. Boxes of food from the States, beers, whiskey bottle crates functioning as tables, hammocks hanging from poles electric fans, tape decks, paraphernalia. The boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags. The clothes are clean, the headbands, the medallions are  out, anything distinctive and individualistic. On the  tapedeck, Jefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'. To Chris it is a new world. And RHAH, the resident head,  sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning re bowl in a three foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be th lord of final judgment in this smoky underworld. Across his naked chest, birds and snakes are tattooed. Ar his neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side On his knuckles 'Love' and 'Hate' are tattooed. In his ey a dancing Satanic fire.

They come up to the edge o it, peer in. Nothing. Barnes walks around it, slips in from back. Chris covers  him, other guys coming up now, making a small perimeter. Chris now starts to see things he didn't see. Right in fr of his nose - there is a trench from this bunker to anoth and another. There is now in his view a complex of bunker and thatched hootches and lean-tos all blending into the  forest. A ghost city... Elias and others fanning out now, careful... whispered  conversations in the wind. Chris moves past a rope with freshly washed laundry stret between two trees, clothes stirring in the wind. He looks as King points out a treehouse, then looks down as Lerner whispers something and points - NVA rucksacks are laid ou on the ground in an orderly platoon-sized pattern.

The SOUND now of a whistle. Two hoots, then a sharp third. Th yelling. Chris grabbing Francis' arm, pointing. There is a VOICE  directly out to the front of them - muttering something i Vietnamese, no more than 20 yards away but unseen. It's l hearing a casual conversation from another room, then the sounds of several bodies moving in separate directions -  encompassing the foxhole.
135) 3) dialog: (to Francis, a whisper) Out of the hole! Fast!
135) 4) text: Chris crawls out, stops, looks back. Francis won't leave, hugs the shelter.
135) 5) dialog: (a fierce whisper) Goddamit Francis! Move your fucking  ass. Now... THEY GONNA BLOW IT!
135) 6) text: Reaches in and yanks him with all his strength half out o the hole. Francis, finally sparked, now moves out. Both o them bellying it into the brush behind the hole. Not a moment too soon. An RPG ROCKET whistling in. The FOXHOLE takes a direct hit, caving in, whirls of smok spinning off it. Chris and Francis look back covered with debris. They hea movement. SHADOWS are swarming towards the foxhole, firing into it finish them off. Francis grabs Chris' leg, indicating they get out of ther Chris hesitates - a moment, a decision made now in angry  passion - rises up and charges the NVA. SHADOWS scatter and tumble, caught by his surprise close- range fire. Chris moving forward into them, blasting, agile, his inst finely tuned, and totally insane in this moment of time,  indifferent to his life. He YELLS insanities, pumping him up with the adrenaline of courage.
135) 7) dialog: DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!! YAAAAAAAAA!!!
135) 8) text: Screams from the dark shadows, they fall. Chris smashing a wounded SHADOW with the butt of his gun  down into the foxhole. He jumps back into it, reoccupying it. Blasting the dead gook. Opening fire out to the front, driving the Shadows back. Francis watching this, amazed. After a moment of doubt, h too tears back out to join Chris in the foxhole, unbeliev as he jumps in with him.
135) 10) text: Then stunned again to see Chris suddenly rise up out of t foxhole and charging forward into the jungle. He is now o the edge.
135) 11) dialog: (charging off into  the jungle) DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!!
136) 0) text: In his position, Bunny is experiencing the same 'high' as Chris, yells out at them.
143) 1) text: Chris bellies into the area, see Barnes, recognizes him,  amazed. An ENEMY fires, taking Barnes high in the left thigh. A p of skin blowing off. Barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like a wounded horse. Holds there, staring into the  Enemy, waiting for the coup de grace. A series of SHOUTS and the Enemy staggers dead as: Chris lays out a curtain of fire. A GRENADE goes off near him, blowing off his helmet. Dazed, Chris rushes forward  firing from the hip - sucked into Barnes' suicidal vacuum He cuts down an Enemy as: Barnes, given a new lease, limps angrily forward and tack a wounded Enemy trying to crawl away, terrified at the si of Barnes coming after him. Barnes lets out a vivid screa And beats the soldier mercilessly, half the stock of his 16 flying apart broken. Chris swivels alert on his knees. A pause. No more enemy. Turns to Barnes, his back to Chris still beating at the d corpse.
143) 2) dialog: Barnes!
143) 3) text: Barnes swivels instinctively off the corpse and for a  petrifying moment Chris sees: A maddened scar of a face, lips specked with foam. The EY refracted in a red-green flare overhead - the pupils dist into angry red points. For Chris it is no doubt the most frightening single imag he has seen in his life. It will be in his nightmares for The essence of evil: wrath, obsession, anger, fear, hatre permanence - he is paralyzed. Barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken s of his M-16. Not even consciously, for at this point, his mind has gone over the edge and the entire world is his e American or Vietnamese, it makes no difference as he stri Chris harder and harder. Chris struggles, moans, his teeth and nose cracked. Barne emits another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up his good right leg, the left bent - set to deliver the ki blow, the mangled rifle pulled to its highest arc.
143) 4) dialog: Nooooooooo!
143) 5) text: The PHANTOM FIGHTER JET comes now like a great white whal One big beautiful monstrous beat of deafening sound. Its  silver and white belly hurtling low over the treeline in giant leap of sound momentarily illuminated by a flare. T a monstrous ROAR of anger. The bomb ripping Barnes off the body of Chris and spittin Chris across the jungle floor - crashing into a tree some yards away.
144) 0) text: FADE BACK IN. Vague sunlight. Blurry. Chris fluttering hi eyes. A sharp MOVEMENT in the bush. His eyes fight their open. SOFT EYES are watching him from behind foliage. A soft, f head, alert, rigidly still. Chris fights his way up to his elbow, in pain, looking at the eyes. The head turns and in one fluid move, bolts. Go Like the wind. A deer. A big brown deer. Or was it? Chris will never be quite sure. But whatever it was, it was sur a sign of grace - the grace of Elias. This he knows as he feels himself for the first time alive. And in pain. His left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his side, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him. Looki around his garden of eden. A messy jungle floor. Cordite  fumes. Burned bush and trees. Torn sandbags. Dead NVA. Bi songs somewhere in the distance. It is the very crack of  dawn, a pink-red sun casting long oblique light patterns  through the trees. A holy light. Chris pushes himself to his feet, feels his weight and th pain. He walks. In the near distance, towards the LZ area there's the sound of Armored Personnel carriers grinding, men moving, calling out in Americanese. But Chris is alon here. He fishes up an AK-47 from a dead NVA. Checks it, a weapo Walks on.
145) 0) text: Past scores of NVA bodies. Past the Foxhole where Bunny l dead in the bottom, faceless. Looking over at Junior bayo to the ground, dead. NVA everywhere around the hole, some them still moving, badly wounded. Chris looking around, then noticing a movement a little  further out in the Jungle. Then he sees who. The uniform is shredded, the figure obviously hurt in sev places (thigh, back, neck, hand) but not mortally so, now struggling to right itself, dragging its face up from a b down position. Streaked with dirt and blood, we see Barne once again re-emerging from the dead. Chris steps over to him, a solemn look on his face. Barne looks up, begs.
145) 2) text: Chris doesn't move. Barnes looks at him again, reading th intention that has crossed Chris' mind. An expression of  surprise crosses his face, then amazement, almost shock.
145) 4) text: Chris shoots him. Once. Twice. Three times. Silence... Barnes is finally dead. Chris looking at the corpse, numbed, no exultation in his expression. Just cold satisfaction and little feeling lef Behind him, the SOUND of a big machine moving. He turns. A huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, foll by the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a  tree for its breakfast. A big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes boudning at him sniffs,  followed by a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and grea unshaven face, earring in his left ear, 'DEATH CORPS' scr on his shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's h he looks like a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel Behind him, a SECOND MONSTER MAN and the ARMORED PERSONNE CARRIER grinding its engine, a human skull hanging from i turret.
145) 6) text: His eyes passing on Chris like so much meat.
145) 8) text: Chris nods. The Soldier pointing to the LZ behind him as sign he should go that way. The other Soldier already  stripping the NVA dead, as the APC grinds on into the jun reconnoitering. Chris walks out of the jungle, head bowed, nauseated, mix feelings roiling him.
149) 0) text: CHRIS is hauled out on a litter. Morphined, his eyes watc it all from somewhere deep in his brain. Passing: Groups of SOLDIERS looking like bowery bums and moving li rats through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs with wheezy tired eyes and grunts of greed. Passing a bulldozed PIT with heaps of NVA BODIES in them. BULLDOZER pushing another set of bodies in, like photos o Nazi death camp. Nearby, two burly SOLDIERS lift a WOMAN NURSE and with a  once-through build for momentum, toss the fresh body into the pit. Chris, numb, goes by.
149) 3) text: CAPTAIN HARRIS doesn't respond; at this point he doesn't  give a shit, standing apart from the radios looking numbl at the remnants of his boys filtering by on litters. Chris intersects him now, Harris' eyes looking blankly, t nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement. Just com to the edge of tears, choking it back, and turning back.  These are his sons who are lost. A good officer. Rodriguez, wounded, is lifted up in his litter and moved to the waiting MEDIVAC CHOPPER, a huge red cross painted a white square. Doc goes by on another litter, then Ace, Adams, Huffmeist etc. Then Francis is littered by, bandages around his leg, a b smile on his face.
149) 5) dialog: Yeah. How 'bout you?
149) 9) dialog: (tries a smile) You bet.
149) 10) text: Chris starts towards it, the Medic assisting him.
151) 4) dialog: I think now, looking back, we did  not fight the enemy, we fought  ourselves - and the enemy was in  us... The war is over for me now,  but it will always be there - the  rest of my days. As I am sure Elias  will be - fighting with Barnes for  what Rhah called possession of my  soul... There are times since I have  felt like the child born of those  two fathers... but be that as it  may, those of us who did make it  have an obligation to build again,  to teach to others what we know and  to try with what's left of our lives  to find a goodness and meaning to  this life...
