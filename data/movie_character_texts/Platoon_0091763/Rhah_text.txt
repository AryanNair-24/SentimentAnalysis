Ammo casing and canvas are piled ove it, and sandbags surround it. From the outside very littl sound can be heard as they go down through a trap door ma of ammo crates. Past a lookout (Adams) pulling security,  hitting a joint but alert. King motions to him, it's cool Inside is another world. Chris looking around amazed. It' like a private cabaret for the 'heads' who are there cool out. Boxes of food from the States, beers, whiskey bottle crates functioning as tables, hammocks hanging from poles electric fans, tape decks, paraphernalia. The boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags. The clothes are clean, the headbands, the medallions are  out, anything distinctive and individualistic. On the  tapedeck, Jefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'. To Chris it is a new world. And RHAH, the resident head,  sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning re bowl in a three foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be th lord of final judgment in this smoky underworld. Across his naked chest, birds and snakes are tattooed. Ar his neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side On his knuckles 'Love' and 'Hate' are tattooed. In his ey a dancing Satanic fire. A poor rural Southern white, in h grizzled late 20's, he could be a Biker King. Giving Chri the once-over.

Rhah watches it all, puffing away on his magic dragon pip the shadows dancing on the walls. It looks like a Saturday night dance party.
