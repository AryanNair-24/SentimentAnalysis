The Doc is hit in the s wounded, struggles, is hit again, but keeps trying to fir He's hit a third time - in the jugular vein. Nearby, Wolf is firing madly at the oncoming NVA. One goes down. A sec is wounded, yelling in pain. Wolfe reloading his 16, popp up, too late. One of them is coming over the sandbags. He sees Wolfe. Wolfe sees him. In the same moment. Wolfe hesitates, frozen up. The gook unloads his AK-47, a magazine worth, into Lieutenant Wolfe, who crashes down,  sprawled unnaturally on the jungle floor. A spasm shakes body. Then stops. Dead. Boots run by.

His helmet is gone, his shirt ripped to sh his shoulder bleeding, making his last stand against the  hated Gooks. Nearby HUFFMEISTER is hit in the shoulder by a running FI and collapses into the bottom of the foxhole, crying out pain. The running FIGURE runs past right into the full force of BARNES' swinging rifle. SMACK! He crumples.
143) 1) text: Chris bellies into the area, see Barnes, recognizes him,  amazed. An ENEMY fires, taking Barnes high in the left thigh. A p of skin blowing off. Barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like a wounded horse. Holds there, staring into the  Enemy, waiting for the coup de grace. A series of SHOUTS and the Enemy staggers dead as: Chris lays out a curtain of fire. A GRENADE goes off near him, blowing off his helmet. Dazed, Chris rushes forward  firing from the hip - sucked into Barnes' suicidal vacuum He cuts down an Enemy as: Barnes, given a new lease, limps angrily forward and tack a wounded Enemy trying to crawl away, terrified at the si of Barnes coming after him. Barnes lets out a vivid screa And beats the soldier mercilessly, half the stock of his 16 flying apart broken. Chris swivels alert on his knees. A pause. No more enemy. Turns to Barnes, his back to Chris still beating at the d corpse.
143) 3) text: Barnes swivels instinctively off the corpse and for a  petrifying moment Chris sees: A maddened scar of a face, lips specked with foam. The EY refracted in a red-green flare overhead - the pupils dist into angry red points. For Chris it is no doubt the most frightening single imag he has seen in his life. It will be in his nightmares for The essence of evil: wrath, obsession, anger, fear, hatre permanence - he is paralyzed. Barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken s of his M-16. Not even consciously, for at this point, his mind has gone over the edge and the entire world is his e American or Vietnamese, it makes no difference as he stri Chris harder and harder. Chris struggles, moans, his teeth and nose cracked. Barne emits another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up his good right leg, the left bent - set to deliver the ki blow, the mangled rifle pulled to its highest arc.
144) 0) text: FADE BACK IN. Vague sunlight. Blurry. Chris fluttering hi eyes. A sharp MOVEMENT in the bush. His eyes fight their open. SOFT EYES are watching him from behind foliage. A soft, f head, alert, rigidly still. Chris fights his way up to his elbow, in pain, looking at the eyes. The head turns and in one fluid move, bolts. Go Like the wind. A deer. A big brown deer. Or was it? Chris will never be quite sure. But whatever it was, it was sur a sign of grace - the grace of Elias. This he knows as he feels himself for the first time alive. And in pain. His left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his side, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him. Looki around his garden of eden. A messy jungle floor. Cordite  fumes. Burned bush and trees. Torn sandbags. Dead NVA. Bi songs somewhere in the distance. It is the very crack of  dawn, a pink-red sun casting long oblique light patterns  through the trees. A holy light. Chris pushes himself to his feet, feels his weight and th pain. He walks. In the near distance, towards the LZ area there's the sound of Armored Personnel carriers grinding, men moving, calling out in Americanese. But Chris is alon here. He fishes up an AK-47 from a dead NVA. Checks it, a weapo Walks on.

NVA everywhere around the hole, some them still moving, badly wounded. Chris looking around, then noticing a movement a little  further out in the Jungle. Then he sees who. The uniform is shredded, the figure obviously hurt in sev places (thigh, back, neck, hand) but not mortally so, now struggling to right itself, dragging its face up from a b down position. Streaked with dirt and blood, we see Barne once again re-emerging from the dead. Chris steps over to him, a solemn look on his face. Barne looks up, begs.
145) 2) text: Chris doesn't move. Barnes looks at him again, reading th intention that has crossed Chris' mind. An expression of  surprise crosses his face, then amazement, almost shock.
145) 4) text: Chris shoots him. Once. Twice. Three times. Silence... Barnes is finally dead. Chris looking at the corpse, numbed, no exultation in his expression. Just cold satisfaction and little feeling lef Behind him, the SOUND of a big machine moving. He turns. A huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, foll by the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a  tree for its breakfast. A big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes boudning at him sniffs,  followed by a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and grea unshaven face, earring in his left ear, 'DEATH CORPS' scr on his shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's h he looks like a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel Behind him, a SECOND MONSTER MAN and the ARMORED PERSONNE CARRIER grinding its engine, a human skull hanging from i turret.

As one of the APC SOLDIERS carves an ear off a dead NVA,  Rhah works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an N Troop in full rigor mortis, extracting what he thought wa there - a wrapped cellophane of heroin. Rhah's face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it, then snorts it. With a certain satisfaction of triumph over th grim circumstances.
149) 3) text: CAPTAIN HARRIS doesn't respond; at this point he doesn't  give a shit, standing apart from the radios looking numbl at the remnants of his boys filtering by on litters. Chris intersects him now, Harris' eyes looking blankly, t nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement. Just com to the edge of tears, choking it back, and turning back.  These are his sons who are lost. A good officer. Rodriguez, wounded, is lifted up in his litter and moved to the waiting MEDIVAC CHOPPER, a huge red cross painted a white square. Doc goes by on another litter, then Ace, Adams, Huffmeist etc. Then Francis is littered by, bandages around his leg, a b smile on his face.
