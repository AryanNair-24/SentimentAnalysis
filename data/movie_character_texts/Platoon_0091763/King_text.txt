Then t RTO, his radio man, humming lightly. Others are behind, t column snaking back deep into the brush. We cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen  later. Young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the fie exhausted yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn,  personalized, hair way past regulation length, medals,  bandannas. A jungle army. Boys. Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. Transfe the machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand. kid cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not even bothering to look ahead. He smells something, lo around, slows his pace, eyes working... around to the bas of a tree. He moves past it. And as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around o dead decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets, worms and flies feasting. Chris draws his breath in, terrified.

The mosquitoes are eating him alive. He buries his head in his green towel which he wears around his nec but he can't see. A beat. He moves again, miserable from bites. Another beat. Then suddenly the sounds of the jung shift - some of the animals dropping out. A different ton A piece of wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush... Chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek  out. A shadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him abou 15 yards. It looks like a man. But it doesn't move. At al It listens. Chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it.  It's a bush. It has to be. No human being could stand tha still. His heartbeats are up. The moments take forever. B deep down - somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is. The figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves. It I human being. Oh my God! Chris looks around. Tex seems like a mile away. Why doesn anyone fire! He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at h grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his trai he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy. The figure seems to whisper something back, then turns an comes down the trail. Now a second and third figure appea behind him - all in helmets and packs. All coming right p Chris' position. Ten yards. Nine. Chris is rigid with terror. Stark eyes. Pleading with Tex wake up, but out of reach. He is about to have an anxiety attack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hea him. The first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail, looking left and right. A rattle of his equipment, creak of leather. A smell. The man's face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on Chris. Oriental eyes. Looking right at him. Startled. Chris star back, hypnotized. It all happens very fast. The figure mu something in Vietnamese. A warning. He swivels. A flash of muzzle fire. A raking cough of automatic fire. grenade explosion. Chris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scatt confused, jarred. All hell breaks loose around him with N and SHOUTS. Tex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him.

Devil's ey mocking child, danger in his soul, excitement, sex - the  Elias that Chris saw in the smoking session in base camp. Chris smiles, sucked in, almost laughs and then the face gone again.

Snapping the magazine out of his AK to reload A live gook. Chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears i the hole. This is the moment, Chris realizes it, it's now never if Chris intends to get the gook. He's got to make move before the man has reloaded his weapon. He pulls his grenade, pops the pin. He lets the spoon fly off, activating the grenade-timer, as he humps to his fee and runs for the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating. That head is going to pop up any second with a freshly-lo weapon and tear his head off. Chris won't make it back to the hole. The throw has to be perfect. He won't get another chance. He heaves the frag, drops and rolls away. The throw is perfect, the golden ar of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner. It tw cleanly in the hole. The explosion muffled but deadly. Chris scrambles to his feet, a look of almost total surpr on his face. He can't seem to believe he did it. Pointing his M-16 before him, he advances on the hole, looking ove the muzzle to see the badly-mangled NVA man twisted at th bottom. Chris hurries over to Lerner.

The Door Gunner  maniacally firing. Barnes looking down at the man, can't believe it. Elias is on his last legs now, obviously being hit by the incoming fire of the NVA. He falls to his knees, still  stretching upwards for life. The Chopper Captain shakes his head at Wolfe. The Chopper dips one more time firing at the NVA, low and fierce over the jungle.

Rodriguez is praying, his mouth moving without audible wo getting ready for the drop. King is making last minute adjustments in his pack. Bunny now nudges Chris, points.

But he  doesn't. Or does he? Perhaps it was the man Chris first s at the airstrip when he came in-country. The same express of evil, of a man who has seen too much and died, but sti lives.

Then nothin A pause. Chris' ears ringing, slightly concussed. Suddenly from down the perimeter there is the sound of a  faulty LOUDSPEAKER crackling out from the jungle. A pidge English, the words mauled, then a snatch of patriotic Nor Vietnamese music, played from a scratchy old record. Chris uneasy, looking at Francis who looks terrified. The SOUND now of a whistle. Two hoots, then a sharp third. Th yelling. Chris grabbing Francis' arm, pointing.

His left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his side, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him. Looki around his garden of eden. A messy jungle floor. Cordite  fumes. Burned bush and trees. Torn sandbags. Dead NVA. Bi songs somewhere in the distance. It is the very crack of  dawn, a pink-red sun casting long oblique light patterns  through the trees. A holy light.
