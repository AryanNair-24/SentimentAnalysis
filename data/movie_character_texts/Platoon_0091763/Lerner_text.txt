Of Indian blood, with long black hair, generous smile, wide facial  bone structure, gypsy eyes, and the cleanest white teeth, could be a young Greek god. He is given somewhat to panac a silver wristband on his arm, a bandanna of black parach silk hanging from his neck, his fatigues tightened down a the ankle, he pulls his pants down, checking for crotch r applying talcum powder to the area, his buttocks facing u LERNER, a white kid, 19, from Florida, stopping to admire the frontal view.

They are all up dancin on their feet - King, Tubbs, Big Harold, Hoyt, Lerner,  Crawford, Flash, Doc, Elias - a few light gestures with t hands above shoulder level, passing around the grass pipe while they shuffle, fingers clicking. The song - Smokey  Robinson's "Tracks of My Tears" - accompanies them from a vintage tapedeck.

Chri is a dead man if... Barnes, checking the terrain, signals radioman Hoyt. Barnes edging up to the bunker, eyes everywhere. Chris  following. The tension builds. They come up to the edge o it, peer in. Nothing. Barnes walks around it, slips in from back. Chris covers  him, other guys coming up now, making a small perimeter. Chris now starts to see things he didn't see. Right in fr of his nose - there is a trench from this bunker to anoth and another. There is now in his view a complex of bunker and thatched hootches and lean-tos all blending into the  forest. A ghost city... Elias and others fanning out now, careful... whispered  conversations in the wind. Chris moves past a rope with freshly washed laundry stret between two trees, clothes stirring in the wind. He looks as King points out a treehouse, then looks down as Lerner whispers something and points - NVA rucksacks are laid ou on the ground in an orderly platoon-sized pattern.

67) 13) text: Lerner translating. The Village Chief's WIFE is now on th scene, a middle-aged woman with angry features, yelling a Lerner trying to answer for her husband, a high-pitched  barrage of indignant words directed mostly at Barnes, and interspersed with the spitting of her betel nuts on the  ground. The Village Chief trying to talk her down. But things are definitely getting out of control. And the heat from the is only aggravating the situation, pounding down on the a in the drama, their fatigues soaked in sweat and anger.

82) 26) dialog: ...don't know. Done some time. Heard  he worked the oil wells in Oklahoma,  made some bread and washed up in El  Lay.
82) 32) dialog: (to Chris) I was home on leave y'know and  everybody's just worried 'bout making  money, everybody's out for themselves,  they don't even want to talk about  it man, it's like the fucking Twilight  Zone back there - you wouldn't even  KNOW there's a war on here. My sister  says to me why you have to go there  like I started this...

93) 5) text: His eyes moving to Sgt. Warren lying alongside a tree - c trying to stack his intestines back into his ruptured sto Another RPG comes in. Chris makes a conscious decision, moves up - bit by bit,  shielding himself with tree stumps, ant hills, laying out fire, trying to get closer to Lerner. Francis following his progress, bug-eyed. Fu Sheng now comes up with his M-60 - Harold his loader,  belts of ammo flapping against their bodies. He fires fro the hip, providing cover fire for Chris, then pops down.
94) 2) text: Lerner groans. A fresh burst of AK fire rakes the area.   Lerner jerks spasmodically with the impact of the rounds. Chris spots the sniper. In a hole in the ground. Twenty-f meters off. Snapping the magazine out of his AK to reload A live gook. Chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears i the hole. This is the moment, Chris realizes it, it's now never if Chris intends to get the gook. He's got to make move before the man has reloaded his weapon. He pulls his grenade, pops the pin. He lets the spoon fly off, activating the grenade-timer, as he humps to his fee and runs for the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating. That head is going to pop up any second with a freshly-lo weapon and tear his head off. Chris won't make it back to the hole. The throw has to be perfect. He won't get another chance. He heaves the frag, drops and rolls away. The throw is perfect, the golden ar of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner. It tw cleanly in the hole. The explosion muffled but deadly. Chris scrambles to his feet, a look of almost total surpr on his face. He can't seem to believe he did it. Pointing his M-16 before him, he advances on the hole, looking ove the muzzle to see the badly-mangled NVA man twisted at th bottom. Chris hurries over to Lerner. He's in bad shape, hit in  several places, vaguely conscious.

101) 7) text: Feeling like a liar, peeling the man's hands off him, lea him there looking numb. Chris is shaken, Lerner's blood a over him. He tears out after Rhah, linking up with Elias and Crawfo Elias motioning them to hurry. Another huge artillery rou exploding out to the front.

Chris catching a glimpse of him, waiting to get on the  chopper, turning to look as: Hoyt and Sgt. Warren, both wounded, are hurried aboard on litters. The chopper lifting off. Chris and others now running to the corpses of Flash,  Morehouse, and Fu Sheng lying under dirty ponchos, their  boots sticking out. The ponchos are blown away in a burst wind off the chopper blades, revealing their faces - dirt stuffing their eyes and mouths, waxen figures. Chris and the others lifting them and carrying them towar the next chopper now coming in. They throw the bodies on. Tubbs and Crawford, both wounde now move past Chris, into the chopper. Chris running back with King carrying a litter - their eyes falling on: Barnes talking with Wolfe and Ace, making signals under t roaring sounds of the chopper. Shaking his head. No. No E Chris and King looking at each other, mute. They numbly s loading Big Harold, minus his leg, onto the stretcher.

The DOOR GUNNER signaling for them to hurry, laying out fire.
