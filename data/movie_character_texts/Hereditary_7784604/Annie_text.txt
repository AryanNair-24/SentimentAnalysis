Suddenly she HEARS the faint sound of a PENCIL VIGOROUSLY SCRATCHING PAPER. It’s coming from down the hall. She hesitates before rising and entering the HALLWAY... More and more flies have collected.

The fire on her arm is mimicking the fire that’s eating the book. Annie SCREAMS, pulls the drawing pad out of the fire, and STAMPS OUT the flames.

One of these is an ORNATE SIGIL (which we recognize as the one on Annie’s necklace). This is the Sigil of PAIMON, and it can now be found all over the room. The TABLE at which Annie and Joan performed the seance (w was then covered in a table-cloth) is now bare, revealing that the tabletop has a LARGE TRIANGLE carved into it (pointing to the northwest). Resting in the middle of the triangle is a PHOTO OF PETER. Beside this is an ATHAME (ritual dagger), a scattering of herbs, and finally... A primitive DIORAMA (the same that we saw earlier on Charlie’s desk, but now finished). Standing center stage crude manikin of a human torso whose head is an actual SEVERED RAVEN HEAD.

Waving away the flies, Annie explores the space. It’s fil with discarded pieces of the family’s past. Old cribs, a mattress, toys, etc. Finally, Annie’s FLASHLIGHT dawns on something. A FIGURE lying prostrate in the corner. Annie approaches it. The f get louder. Annie finally gets close enough to SEE... It is a WOMAN’S CORPSE, and upon closer inspection, its H is seen to be MISSING. From the white and wrinkled hands, it’s evident that this was an old woman. She is also wear a WHITE SILK ROBE - identical to the one that Charlie saw corpse wearing earlier in the woods. (Is this Ellen Leigh corpse?) A large TRIANGLE has been drawn in chalk around body.

Repetitive, minimal PERCUSSION (like subdued war drums) thumps faintly and steadily in the distance. INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 147 Silence. Max’s barking has STOPPED. Peter’s eyes blink OPEN from his deep sleep. He bolts up a start. He’s in his room, under the covers. He squints with pain. He reaches to touch his nose, but discovers the heavy plaster bandage. Outside Peter’s window: the TREEHOUSE. A dim, golden ligh like candlelight - flickers from within. Peter stares at it. The drums are barely heard in the b.g They will continue. The drums are momentarily drowned out by the sound of a C DRIVING BY outside. Its HEADLIGHTS gently illuminate Pete room, scanning the walls (in pale blue) as the car drifts For the briefest moment, in this fleeting light, we see.. ANNIE, still wearing her nightgown, in the top corner of room. She seems to be FLOATING WEIGHTLESSLY. She’s so elevated, in fact, that her head is turned to the side an her cheek pressed against the ceiling. 148 111. There’s something still and composed about her; something resolutely NOT Annie. Her eyes are WIDE and her face expressionless. She’s behind Peter, STARING at his back. doesn’t notice. The car has now passed, and the room is obscured again in darkness. Annie is no longer clearly visible. Peter senses something behind him. He pauses, listens. Th he begins to TURN. Annie, back pressed against the wall, scrambles (in a sil panic) across the wall and OUT the door. She seems to be WALKING across the wall’s surface. Peter looks back just as Annie has left.

And lying before the fireplace is... A CHARRED, BLACK CORPSE. It lies twisted on the rug. Peter stands frozen, trying to discern what it is. He tak reluctant step forward and slowly approaches the dark fig Peter finally comes close enough to SEE... The body’s HEAD has been violently AMPUTATED. The PINK/RE the exposed neck contrasts garishly with the crisped whol The body is on its back, arched and contorted. Peter looks at the HANDS. The fingers are curled into desperate claws. One finger bears STEVE’S WEDDING RING. Peter opens his mouth to scream, but all that comes out i muted gust of air. Tears well in his eyes. He can’t even summon the strength to look away. And above him... ANNIE is huddled up into a corner of the ceiling. Her fac twisted with grief and fear, and she is shaking her head “no, no, no, no, no” — as if pleading with the back of Peter’s head, like a frightened animal. She holds PIANO W pulling it taut with both hands. Wringing blood. Peter FREEZES, sensing something behind him. He slowly tu but not toward Annie... Peter looks to the other corner of the room. The CLOSET D is cracked open. Peter SQUINTS at it. Standing in the dar closet, barely visible, is a MAN IN A RED CLOAK - staring him. Peter is paralyzed. He then SENSES something in the corner of the ceiling - w Annie was. His eyes scan tensely to the corner, but Annie now GONE. 151 152 153 113. Pregnant silence. Suddenly, from behind Peter, Annie BURSTS SCREAMING out o the darkness, dashing towards him. Peter RUNS squealing out of the room. He sprints for the STAIRS. Peter bounds up the staircase, but at the top step, he tr over his own foot. He crashes to his knees, scrambling to back up. Behind him, we hear Annie pursuing. Peter races madly through the HALLWAY. The attic hatch is inexplicably OPEN. He dashes for the ATTIC STAIRS. He runs up the stairs and immediately RETRACTS them - jus Annie reaches him. Peter manages to pull the attic hatch SHUT, almost catching Annie’s bloody fingers.

They even look a bit cloud He looks ahead to the TREEHOUSE... PETER’S POV: Annie’s floating body has arrived at the treehouse, which is still glowing by candlelight. She asc into it. For a split-second, before she disappears into t treehouse, we see that ANNIE HAS NO HEAD. Peter rises to his feet, hollow-eyed. His gaze trained on treehouse. He seems to be in some sort of TRANCE - much l the trance that Charlie entered earlier. After a moment o standing, staring at the treehouse...Peter CLICKS HIS TON With that, he begins walking slowly toward the treehouse. He passes MAX'S DEAD CARCASS, sprawled across a snow-buri garden. As Peter nears the treehouse, he looks up to its OPEN WINDOW... Through the window, from Peter’s low-angle POV: a birdcag hangs from the treehouse ceiling. It houses a manic WHIPPOORWILL.

The manikin’s oth hand is raised to extend its first two fingers and thumb; third and fourth fingers are bent (like a Christ figure). Bowing at the foot of the manikin is ANNIE’S HEADLESS TOR blood pooling at the neck. Beside her corpse, also prostrated, is ANNIE’S MOTHER’S HEADLESS CORPSE (still dressed in white silk, but in a worse state of decay). Peter's eyes are WIDE, but still blank. They are FIXED on Charlie’s head. He looks more confused than horrified. Peter turns around to face the groveling red-cloaked worshippers. They now seem to be bowing in his direction. Among the worshippers is JOAN - her forehead pressed to t floor. Peter, unnerved, looks away. He notices... A photo portrait of ANNIE’S MOTHER on the wall. She sits upright and her expression is severe. The frame bears an engraving: “Queen Leigh” We come to a CLOSE-UP of Peter. He looks confused and sca (although not in a way that feels like Peter).
