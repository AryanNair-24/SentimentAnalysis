They seem especially prominent around the ATTIC DOOR on the ceiling. Noting this, Annie continues to follow the sound of drawi to arrive at... INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 119 The door is open. The lights are OFF. The sound of PENCIL FEVERISHLY SCRATCHING PAPER is heard, although the room i completely empty. Annie stands at the door. She hesitates before turning on light. CHARLIE’S DRAWING PAD rests on Charlie’s bed. It’s open t mostly blank page, but a DRAWING IS MATERIALIZING on it. is then FLIPPED (as if by wind) to the next page, where a drawing begins. We can’t yet see the content of the drawi Annie approaches the drawing pad to investigate. Her eyes already buzzing with fear, now widen with HORROR. INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 120 The door is closed and the lights are off. Peter is inbed trying to sleep. Silence, save for a buzzing fly. Then... A CLICKING of the tongue. Peter’s eyes OPEN. He slowly lo up, scanning past the bed, to SEE... CHARLIE is standing in the dark corner of the room (where Peter mistook his hoodie for a person). Charlie stares at Peter with unblinking eyes. It’s almost too dark to make out. Another CLICK. 121 122 123 Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 94.
83) 1) dialog: Charlie? A long silence. Charlie slowly opens her MOUTH, but then head DROOPS forward and rolls OFF her shoulders. It tumbl to the floor and rolls toward Peter, but when it rolls in block of moonlight (cast from the window), it’s revealed be a Nerf basketball. Peter glares at the ball. A quiet GROWLING is heard from door. Peter looks up. The door is now OPEN and Max stands in the doorway. He se to be disturbed by Peter - or rather, by something standi behind Peter.
83) 2) dialog: (terrified) What is it, Max? Suddenly TWO HANDS materialize from behind Peter’s head. grab his face, grasping under his chin. They TUG BACK on head, as if trying to yank it off. Peter SCREAMS. Max runs in to attack, but the DOOR SLAMS IN HIS FACE.

88) 0) text: Peter steps out of his bedroom, backpack slung over his shoulder. He clearly didn’t sleep last night and his eyes buzzing with anxiety. He looks down the hall at the workshop’s DOOR, which is open by the faintest CRACK. He hesitates and walks off. Behind the workshop door: ANNIE stares through the crack, making sure that Peter leaves. Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 97. 128 INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR - MOMENT Annie, looking frighteningly determined, emerges from the elevator of JOAN’S BUILDING. She’s still wearing her nightgown under a coat. She rushes to JOAN’S DOOR and kno No answer. Annie knocks again, more urgently. 129 INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 129 Nobody's home. We are pulling back from the DOOR (as Anni knocking persists) to REVEAL the apartment... It looks mostly the same, but it’s now adorned in cloths drapes that feature various SYMBOLS. One of these is an ORNATE SIGIL (which we recognize as the one on Annie’s necklace). This is the Sigil of PAIMON, and it can now be found all over the room. The TABLE at which Annie and Joan performed the seance (w was then covered in a table-cloth) is now bare, revealing that the tabletop has a LARGE TRIANGLE carved into it (pointing to the northwest). Resting in the middle of the triangle is a PHOTO OF PETER. Beside this is an ATHAME (ritual dagger), a scattering of herbs, and finally... A primitive DIORAMA (the same that we saw earlier on Charlie’s desk, but now finished). Standing center stage crude manikin of a human torso whose head is an actual SEVERED RAVEN HEAD. Atop the head is an aluminum-foil CRO Three other sculptures BOW ON THEIR KNEES to the raven-he figure. Their heads are the severed PIGEON HEAD (now decomposing), a severed RAT HEAD and a severed SQUIRREL H Annie's knocking continues.

PETER is seated at an empty table near the fence eating (or rather, not eating) the cafeteria food. 132 Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 98. The TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and imposing. Peter LISTENS to losing himself in the white noise. But there’s something looming underneath the traffic noise... It's like a distant YELLING, but too distant to make out. Slowly it becomes clearer, more distinct. It’s a WOMAN’S VOICE and it’s yelling “Peter.” Peter looks up. Where is it coming from?
90) 5) dialog: Peter looks back at her. They MEET EYES.
90) 9) dialog: INT. ANNIE’S WORKSHOP - DAY 132 Annie runs in from the hallway. She rushes to the BOXES marked “Mom’s Things.” She opens first box and finds a HAND-EMBROIDERED WELCOME MAT. It’s exact same style as Joan’s. Embroidered into it is the na “ANNIE”. Under that is another mat, bearing the name “CHARLES” and featuring the now-familiar sigil of PAIMON. Annie goes to the next box. She dig through a collection herbs and oils, and beneath those, she finds a familiar hardback: NOTES ON SPIRITUALISM. Below this, a couple oth hardbacks: one that appears to be a GRIMOIRE (book of spe and the other titled INVOCATIONS. Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 99. INVOCATIONS’ cover features an esoteric sigil. Annie open the book to find that it’s filled with vivid etchings of DEMONIC POSSESSION RITUALS. Annie goes to a MARKED PAGE. It features an illustration beastly man with a hulking body and a strangely effeminat face. He rides a dromedary and wears a crown. Tied to his is a collection of SEVERED HEADS. Behind him is a queue o frolicking ghouls, all headless and all playing instrumen A title reads “King Paimon (God of Mischief)." Annie finds a HIGHLIGHTED PARAGRAPH: "When successfully invoked, Paimon will possess the most vulnerable host. On when the ritual is complete will Paimon be locked into hi ordained host. Once locked in, a new ritual is required t unlock the possession." A sentence underlined in pencil reads: "Paimon is Male, t covetous of a male human body." The next page features an etching of a man sitting atopa mountain of treasure. A caption reads: “The riches to the conjurer." Annie comes to the TITLE PAGE of the book. There isa handwritten NOTE. It reads: My darling, dear, beautiful Annie, Forgive me all the things I could not tell you, as TI truly could not. Please don’t hate me and try not to despair your losses. You will see in the end that they were worth it. Our sacrifice will pale next to the rewards. Love, Mommy Mortified, Annie throws the book into the box, and digs deeper to find TWO PHOTO ALBUMS, familiarly titled “Memories.” Annie flips through one of the albums. For a while, nothi of note. But then she FINDS something... A PHOTO of ANNIE’S MOTHER, 20 years younger, standing wit JOAN, also 20 years younger. They both wear replicas of Annie's NECKLACE - the one bearing the now-familiar sigil Paimon. Stunned, Annie continues through the photo album. She fin SEVERAL MORE PHOTOS FEATURING JOAN, who's often standing the background. Always wearing the necklace. She and Anni Mother were evidently close friends. Another photo: Annie’s mother guides a baby bottle into B CHARLIE’s mouth. The bottle’s milk is polluted with black herbs. 133 134 135 100. Finally, Annie comes to a particularly bizarre photo. It features Joan pouring gold/silver coins over Annie’s Moth head. Annie’s Mother, wearing a tiara, is weeping/laughin tears of joy. They are surrounded by an intimate, APPLAUD audience.

The light seems to disappear at Peter’s CLASSROOM. Peter stares at the door. Through the door’s window, MR. DAVIES (the teacher) turns see Peter. They lock eyes. Davies smiles expectantly.

The light goes GREEN. INT. ANNIE’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 142 Annie is still waiting anxiously in her car. Steve’s car is seen pulling into the Graham driveway. Ann heaves a relieved sigh - “finally!” But then she notices Steve is pulling an unconscious Peter out of the back sea She sees Peter’s bandaged nose and PANICS.

Repetitive, minimal PERCUSSION (like subdued war drums) thumps faintly and steadily in the distance. INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 147 Silence. Max’s barking has STOPPED. Peter’s eyes blink OPEN from his deep sleep. He bolts up a start. He’s in his room, under the covers. He squints with pain. He reaches to touch his nose, but discovers the heavy plaster bandage. Outside Peter’s window: the TREEHOUSE. A dim, golden ligh like candlelight - flickers from within. Peter stares at it. The drums are barely heard in the b.g They will continue. The drums are momentarily drowned out by the sound of a C DRIVING BY outside. Its HEADLIGHTS gently illuminate Pete room, scanning the walls (in pale blue) as the car drifts For the briefest moment, in this fleeting light, we see.. ANNIE, still wearing her nightgown, in the top corner of room. She seems to be FLOATING WEIGHTLESSLY. She’s so elevated, in fact, that her head is turned to the side an her cheek pressed against the ceiling. 148 111. There’s something still and composed about her; something resolutely NOT Annie. Her eyes are WIDE and her face expressionless. She’s behind Peter, STARING at his back. doesn’t notice. The car has now passed, and the room is obscured again in darkness. Annie is no longer clearly visible. Peter senses something behind him. He pauses, listens. Th he begins to TURN. Annie, back pressed against the wall, scrambles (in a sil panic) across the wall and OUT the door. She seems to be WALKING across the wall’s surface. Peter looks back just as Annie has left.

And lying before the fireplace is... A CHARRED, BLACK CORPSE. It lies twisted on the rug. Peter stands frozen, trying to discern what it is. He tak reluctant step forward and slowly approaches the dark fig Peter finally comes close enough to SEE... The body’s HEAD has been violently AMPUTATED. The PINK/RE the exposed neck contrasts garishly with the crisped whol The body is on its back, arched and contorted. Peter looks at the HANDS. The fingers are curled into desperate claws. One finger bears STEVE’S WEDDING RING. Peter opens his mouth to scream, but all that comes out i muted gust of air. Tears well in his eyes. He can’t even summon the strength to look away. And above him... ANNIE is huddled up into a corner of the ceiling. Her fac twisted with grief and fear, and she is shaking her head “no, no, no, no, no” — as if pleading with the back of Peter’s head, like a frightened animal. She holds PIANO W pulling it taut with both hands. Wringing blood. Peter FREEZES, sensing something behind him. He slowly tu but not toward Annie... Peter looks to the other corner of the room. The CLOSET D is cracked open. Peter SQUINTS at it. Standing in the dar closet, barely visible, is a MAN IN A RED CLOAK - staring him. Peter is paralyzed.

Peter now looks to the CORNER that earlier enshrined the headless corpse. The corpse is now gone, but something ti has replaced it. The distance and weak light preclude Pet from identifying it. 114. Peter begins to approach the corner, tears streaming. He the bloody sigil on the vaulted ceiling above. As he walk the buzzing gets LOUDER, more concentrated. Peter continues warily toward the corner, his fear rising The buzzing has gotten even louder. Finally Peter gets cl enough to SEE... In the center of the chalk-etched triangle is a PHOTOGRAP PETER WITH HIS EYES X’d OUT. Stunned and confused, Peter REELS back, knocking over a candle. The corner goes dark. Peter is weeping uncontroll now. He starts backing away, toward the room’s center. Hi eyes remain glued to his photograph. PETER (CONT’D) (to himself, crying) Please. This isn’t happening. You need to wake up. Peter’s teeth are chattering. He’s hyperventilating. His trembling silhouette is framed by the WINDOW behind him. Outside the window: dreamy snowfall. Peter continues backing up, but something makes him FREEZ prolonged GROAN, accompanied by the sound of WIRE being wrapped and tightened around FLESH. It’s coming from a so about twenty feet away, BEHIND him. This is followed by a swifter, HARSHER SOUND - like a saw being dragged through flesh. A pregnant PAUSE and then the sound REPEATS. A bri pause and it REPEATS again. Peter slowly turns around. His eyes travel up to SEE... ANNIE has somehow gotten in. She floats weightlessly in t air.

After a moment, a SHADOW floats gracefully across the snow. It belongs to Annie, who must be above us - but the shadow seems headle The shadow drifts out of frame, followed by the vague, familiar STREAK OF LIGHT.

They even look a bit cloud He looks ahead to the TREEHOUSE... PETER’S POV: Annie’s floating body has arrived at the treehouse, which is still glowing by candlelight. She asc into it. For a split-second, before she disappears into t treehouse, we see that ANNIE HAS NO HEAD. Peter rises to his feet, hollow-eyed. His gaze trained on treehouse. He seems to be in some sort of TRANCE - much l the trance that Charlie entered earlier. After a moment o standing, staring at the treehouse...Peter CLICKS HIS TON With that, he begins walking slowly toward the treehouse. He passes MAX'S DEAD CARCASS, sprawled across a snow-buri garden. As Peter nears the treehouse, he looks up to its OPEN WINDOW... Through the window, from Peter’s low-angle POV: a birdcag hangs from the treehouse ceiling. It houses a manic WHIPPOORWILL. We cut to a WIDE of the treehouse as Peter arrives at the tree’s base. Peter pauses. Looks up. After a beat, he begins to leaden climb up.

Placed atop its shoulder (in lieu of a head) is CHARLIE’S DECAPITATED HEAD - now i advanced state of decomposition. The nose is still smashe in, much of the face is black with rot, and it wears asil CROWN. One hand grips a wooden SCEPTER. The manikin’s oth hand is raised to extend its first two fingers and thumb; third and fourth fingers are bent (like a Christ figure). Bowing at the foot of the manikin is ANNIE’S HEADLESS TOR blood pooling at the neck. Beside her corpse, also prostrated, is ANNIE’S MOTHER’S HEADLESS CORPSE (still dressed in white silk, but in a worse state of decay). Peter's eyes are WIDE, but still blank. They are FIXED on Charlie’s head. He looks more confused than horrified. Peter turns around to face the groveling red-cloaked worshippers. They now seem to be bowing in his direction. Among the worshippers is JOAN - her forehead pressed to t floor. Peter, unnerved, looks away. He notices... A photo portrait of ANNIE’S MOTHER on the wall. She sits upright and her expression is severe. The frame bears an engraving: “Queen Leigh” We come to a CLOSE-UP of Peter. He looks confused and sca (although not in a way that feels like Peter).

She then c to stand (now off-screen) before Peter. After a moment, t CROWN enters frame to be placed ceremoniously onto Peter' head. Peter has TENSED up, desperately avoiding eye contact wit Joan. He SENSES something behind him. He looks back (and pan-tilt) to see... The headless corpses of Peter’s family are now inexplicab bowing in his direction. Peter turns forward again - overwhelmed. He looks trapped Trembling. His milky eyes are welling with tears. 117.
