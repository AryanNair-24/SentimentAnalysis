Joan tries to think of a suitably ecstatic adjective.
71) 15) dialog: They brought back the spirit of a man from the 19th century! And not like as a smoke and mirrors thing. The man next to me was a deadly cynical neurologist, and he looked permanently changed by the end of it. Annie makes another “wow” face. 96 65.

71) 61) dialog: Here: (handing them to her) If you wanna try this yourself, light the candle and choose one item that belonged to your daughter - that’1l be your link to her. Mine was the chalkboard. That’s my link. And then, when you’re ready - (seriously, re: the paper) - read this out loud - every syllable - very carefully.
71) 63) dialog: I don’t know what language it is. The medium had me read it, too. It’s to make it start. But your whole family - everyone needs to be in the room. Your son. Everyone. Annie uneasily accepts the articles and then turns to lea As she walks toward the door:

She rushes to JOAN’S DOOR and kno No answer. Annie knocks again, more urgently. 129 INT. JOAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 129 Nobody's home. We are pulling back from the DOOR (as Anni knocking persists) to REVEAL the apartment... It looks mostly the same, but it’s now adorned in cloths drapes that feature various SYMBOLS. One of these is an ORNATE SIGIL (which we recognize as the one on Annie’s necklace). This is the Sigil of PAIMON, and it can now be found all over the room. The TABLE at which Annie and Joan performed the seance (w was then covered in a table-cloth) is now bare, revealing that the tabletop has a LARGE TRIANGLE carved into it (pointing to the northwest). Resting in the middle of the triangle is a PHOTO OF PETER. Beside this is an ATHAME (ritual dagger), a scattering of herbs, and finally... A primitive DIORAMA (the same that we saw earlier on Charlie’s desk, but now finished). Standing center stage crude manikin of a human torso whose head is an actual SEVERED RAVEN HEAD. Atop the head is an aluminum-foil CRO Three other sculptures BOW ON THEIR KNEES to the raven-he figure.

The walls are lined with black candles, and before Peter several MEN AND WOMAN (some elderly, some middle-aged) BO on their knees, foreheads against the floor. They are all dressed in RED CLOAKS. Standing behind Peter (on the opposite side of the treeho is the terrible object of their reverence. He turns to se A GIANT, 6’ WOOD-FIGURE MANIKIN. Placed atop its shoulder (in lieu of a head) is CHARLIE’S DECAPITATED HEAD - now i advanced state of decomposition. The nose is still smashe in, much of the face is black with rot, and it wears asil CROWN. One hand grips a wooden SCEPTER. The manikin’s oth hand is raised to extend its first two fingers and thumb; third and fourth fingers are bent (like a Christ figure). Bowing at the foot of the manikin is ANNIE’S HEADLESS TOR blood pooling at the neck. Beside her corpse, also prostrated, is ANNIE’S MOTHER’S HEADLESS CORPSE (still dressed in white silk, but in a worse state of decay). Peter's eyes are WIDE, but still blank. They are FIXED on Charlie’s head. He looks more confused than horrified. Peter turns around to face the groveling red-cloaked worshippers. They now seem to be bowing in his direction. Among the worshippers is JOAN - her forehead pressed to t floor. Peter, unnerved, looks away. He notices... A photo portrait of ANNIE’S MOTHER on the wall. She sits upright and her expression is severe. The frame bears an engraving: “Queen Leigh” We come to a CLOSE-UP of Peter. He looks confused and sca (although not in a way that feels like Peter). We will HO on this CU for the remainder of the scene. The sound of someone RISING. This person (Joan) shuffles Peter to lift the crown off of Charlie’s head. She then c to stand (now off-screen) before Peter. After a moment, t CROWN enters frame to be placed ceremoniously onto Peter' head. Peter has TENSED up, desperately avoiding eye contact wit Joan. He SENSES something behind him. He looks back (and pan-tilt) to see... The headless corpses of Peter’s family are now inexplicab bowing in his direction. Peter turns forward again - overwhelmed. He looks trapped Trembling. His milky eyes are welling with tears. 117.
108) 1) dialog: (quietly, trying to soothe) Hey hey - no no - you're all right... But he is starting to PANIC. His eyes fix fearfully to th floor as his breathing grows erratic. Then:
108) 2) dialog: Hey: hey: Charlie. Peter's breathing HALTS. He looks up to Joan, still trembling. Eyes wide.
108) 3) dialog: You're all right now. A long silence as Peter searches Joan's face for understanding. Peter finally SPEAKS...but he sounds more CHARLIE than Peter.
108) 5) dialog: You are Paimon. One of the eight Kings of Hell. Beat. Peter doesn’t react. He just stares at her, uncomprehending.
108) 6) dialog: We have looked to the northwest and called you in. We’ve corrected your first body and give you now this healthy male host. We reject the Trinity and pray devoutly to you, great Paimon: give us your knowledge of all secret things and all mysteries of the Earth; bring us honor, wealth and good familiars; and bind all men to our Will, as we have bound ourselves for now and ever to Yours.
