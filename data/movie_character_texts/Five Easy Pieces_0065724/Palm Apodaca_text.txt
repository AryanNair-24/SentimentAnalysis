49) 7) dialog: Rotate, mack!
49) 17) dialog: Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
49) 21) dialog: Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
49) 24) dialog: Come on, Terry, we got a ride!

50) 22) dialog: We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
50) 26) dialog: Alaska.
50) 34) dialog: (to Terry) You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.

52) 12) dialog: Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
52) 17) dialog: A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.

52) 29) dialog: In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...

56) 29) dialog: Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
