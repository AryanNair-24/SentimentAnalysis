65) 42) dialog: At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...

71) 1) text: Dinner has concluded and Tita moves around the table, distributing cups and saucers. Carl is remote and off his feed. Spicer attends Nicholas, and Catherine looks across the table to Bobby as he drinks from a bottle of beer. After a moment, a loud belch comes from Nicholas and Tita quickly requests:
71) 8) dialog: I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
71) 27) text: Though Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces disapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:
71) 29) dialog: Robert, do you mind?
71) 33) dialog: Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
71) 38) dialog: (a bit martyred) Well, maybe if we put the Thermaphore on me for a while, first...

75) 26) text: Carl comes back to the table.
75) 28) dialog: Any particular humor, I meant.
75) 32) text: He hits a smash and it sails past Carl into some shrubbery several yards away.
75) 34) dialog: Dammit!
75) 42) text: She looks at Carl, bent over and searching through the shrubs.
75) 55) text: Bobby gestures his paddle at Carl, on his way back with the ball.
75) 60) text: Carl comes up to the table, asserting:
75) 62) dialog: See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?

84) 25) dialog: You've been staying in a motel all this time?

84) 37) dialog: Not at all.
84) 53) text: Carl laughs.

89) 18) text: Carl starts to answer and is pre-empted by Samia:
89) 55) text: She leaves the room, with Bobby's eyes following her, and as Carl moves over to sit beside Rayette, Samia resumes to Fincher while the other friend moves in beside Bobby and tries to engage him in conversation.
89) 64) dialog: It's a Borzoi.
89) 70) text: Bobby, now feeling trapped by the other friend, looks across to her ass she returns her attention to Carl.
