64) 10) text: looking from Carl, to Catherine. He watches her briefly, then steps out of the doorway...
65) 2) text: Bobby, at the opposite end of the table, is seated next to Tita. Unable to bear looking at his father, he glances over at Catherine, seated next to Carl on his right.
65) 7) dialog: (to Bobby) How long have you been... (To Tita) Oh, excuse me...
65) 11) dialog: I was just going to ask Robert how long he's been away from here.
65) 27) dialog: What have you been doing since then?
65) 31) dialog: And you no longer play at all?
65) 62) text: Tita gets up from the table and, taking her plate, exits to the kitchen. And as Carl readjusts himself in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass, Bobby looks at Catherine to find her looking at him. She quickly alters her gaze to Carl.
65) 64) dialog: I wouldn't mind doing a little work, if you're finished, and not too tired...
65) 72) text: Catherine stands up and, wanting to change the subject:
65) 74) dialog: Excuse me, I don't want to hear this...
67) 1) text: Bobby strolls casually about the house - in truth, looking for an opportunity to run into Catherine.
67) 5) text: Catherine can be seen, seated at the piano. Carl stands above her and they engage in some exchange about the score resting on the piano's music stand.
69) 2) text: ... Catherine coming up from the ocean. She wears a bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a towel, and as she approaches:
69) 4) dialog: Hello...
69) 8) dialog: (amused) Yes, intentionally.
69) 12) dialog: Swimming?
69) 17) dialog: I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
69) 21) dialog: Why?
69) 28) dialog: Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
69) 32) dialog: Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
69) 36) dialog: I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
70) 1) text: Catherine comes inside and moves toward the stairway, with Bobby behind.
70) 3) dialog: Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
70) 8) dialog: After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
70) 12) dialog: Tomorrow's a full practice day... (continues up the stairs) But the day after is kind of open.
70) 15) dialog: Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
70) 19) dialog: If you're free.
71) 1) text: Dinner has concluded and Tita moves around the table, distributing cups and saucers. Carl is remote and off his feed.

71) 4) text: She attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do Bobby and Catherine, then changes the subject:
71) 9) text: Catherine begins pouring the coffee.
71) 11) dialog: One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
71) 19) dialog: I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
71) 23) dialog: You don't call that music, though.
71) 27) text: Though Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces disapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:
71) 34) text: He takes hold of Catherine's hand and stands up.
71) 36) dialog: We really don't have to, Carl, if you're not feeling good...
71) 40) dialog: Oh, all right.
74) 2) text: Bobby stands in the hallway, a phone to his ear, listening to Rayette and looking down the hall toward the open door to Catherine's room.

76) 1) text: Bobby knocks on Catherine's door and, hearing no response, opens it and steps inside.
77) 1) text: He wanders about, discreetly touching nothing, but taking in some essence of Catherine from her belongings and from the scent of her that lingers in the room.
79) 2) text: Presently, Catherine appears in the doorway. She stands listening for a moment, then places the shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and sits down.
79) 11) text: ... then to Catherine, profoundly moved.
79) 17) dialog: That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
79) 21) dialog: I was really very moved by the way you...
79) 24) dialog: Is that funny?
79) 28) dialog: Why?
79) 32) dialog: It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
79) 36) dialog: You had no inner feeling?
79) 40) dialog: Then I must have been supplying it.
79) 45) dialog: Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
79) 49) dialog: At being a fake.
79) 54) dialog: No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
80) 6) dialog: I think it's what you think.
80) 10) dialog: Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
80) 15) dialog: (stops and turns to him) I don't think that's accurate...
80) 19) dialog: I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
80) 24) dialog: I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
80) 36) dialog: I don't find your language that charming.
80) 40) dialog: I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
80) 43) dialog: You're not a serious person, by your own admission. And that may be interesting, but it doesn't interest me...
80) 48) dialog: Yes, that's what's important to me...
80) 54) dialog: No, don't do that...
80) 57) text: He hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants to say and cannot. Catherine looks up at him, uttering a quiet challenge:
80) 59) dialog: No inner feeling.
80) 63) dialog: I don't believe vou.
81) 1) text: Catherine and Bobby lie side by side. He watches her as she addresses the ceiling:
81) 3) dialog: I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
81) 7) dialog: Something witty and devastating like that.
81) 10) dialog: As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... (a pause, then:) How are you?
81) 14) dialog: Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
81) 18) dialog: Yes.
81) 21) dialog: Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
81) 26) dialog: Robert?
81) 30) dialog: I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
82) 2) text: Bobby and Catherine walk over a path through a thickly wooded area that presently brings them in sight of the Dupea house. He stops and, taking hold of her, leans back against a tree, kissing her. When they break off and resume walking, she takes one of his hands in both of hers and, after looking at the scars and callouses accumulated by his years of manual labor, she lays the hand against her cheek.
84) 23) text: fascinated with Rayette, while beside him, Catherine keeps her eyes on her plate as she eats.
84) 38) text: She goes on eating and there is a brief silence before she resumes, looking over at Catherine:
84) 42) dialog: Thank you.
88) 1) text: Bobby's car pulls off the ferry and approaches a line of cars waiting to board. He sees Catherine at the wheel of the first car, and pulling abreast of her, stops and rolls down his window.
88) 5) dialog: I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
88) 9) dialog: I'll be back later...
88) 14) dialog: No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
88) 23) dialog: No, I can't...
88) 27) dialog: I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
88) 31) dialog: What?! I can't hear you!
88) 34) dialog: I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
88) 38) dialog: Please, I'll see you later this evening.
89) 3) text: a friend of Carl's. (Somewhere under the following, the ANGLE ALTERS to include TWO OTHER FRIENDS, as well as Carl, Catherine, Bobby and Rayette, seated around the living room, variously captive to her monologue.)
89) 34) dialog: (cutting her off) And what about love?
89) 38) dialog: No, I wouldn't.
89) 47) dialog: I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
89) 52) dialog: (cutting her off) You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
90) 3) text: running up the stairs and down the hall to Catherine's room. He goes inside and, not finding her, comes quickly back into the hall. As he moves down it, opening other doors, he begins calling her name.
91) 49) text: ... Carl, Catherine and Tita run into the kitchen, looking to:
91) 53) text: He looks past her, to Catherine.
92) 1) text: Catherine and Bobby sit on a low stone wall bordering the Dupea property. Each is staring out at the ocean, and after a moment:
92) 3) dialog: No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
92) 7) dialog: I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you... (she looks at him) I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
92) 12) dialog: Yes.
92) 16) dialog: I hope it will, yes. (she pauses, then:) I'm sorry.
