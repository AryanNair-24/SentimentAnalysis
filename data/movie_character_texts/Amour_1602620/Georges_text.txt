0) 52) dialog: They used a screwdriver or something like that...it doesn't look very professional...
0) 56) dialog: No idea. Why do people break in? Because they want to steal something.
0) 60) dialog: (laughs briefly out loud) Hey, why not? If I thought about it, I could come up with at least three or four people we know who've been burgled.
0) 66) dialog: I'll do that tomorrow morning. Anyway, they didn't see anything.
0) 69) dialog: Don't let it spoil your good mood now.
0) 73) dialog: Come on, give me your coat.
0) 78) dialog: Why should I imagine that?
0) 82) dialog: 
0) 86) dialog: Shall we have a drink?
0) 90) dialog: I still fancy a drink.
0) 97) dialog: They must have been professionals.
0) 100) dialog: Did I tell you, you looked good tonight?
0) 117) dialog: Something wrong?
0) 127) dialog: (on the phone) What about next week? No but still, it would make sense to get it done soon. It might give people silly ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to look at... Wednesday? What time? OK... Will you bring the paint with you too, to paint over it? But at least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank you.
0) 130) dialog: 
0) 135) dialog: (laughs while acquiescing) Yes, that's true. (Reacting when she places the egg in his egg cup) Thanks. If I call a regular professional, we'll still be waiting two months time.
0) 141) dialog: The Frodons waited three days when their toilet was blocked. Not exactly pleasant.
0) 144) dialog: The saltcellar is empty.
0) 147) dialog: I don't know if he's going to bring us the CD. Maybe he won't come at all. In any case, he didn't mention it. I'd like to buy it. It was really good and I don't want to wait long for it. We could go to Virgin this afternoon and buy it. What do you say?
0) 150) dialog: Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?
0) 153) dialog: What's going on? What's the matter?
0) 156) dialog: Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!
0) 159) dialog: (serious now) Anne! What's going on?
0) 162) dialog: Anne, what's the matter? 8.
0) 166) dialog: Anne...what's...
0) 169) dialog: Anne...
0) 175) dialog: (close to tears) Anne...Darling...please!
0) 180) dialog: Anne?
0) 191) dialog: (both aghast and furious) Hey, what's going on? Are you completely crazy? Is this supposed to be a joke, or what's going on?
0) 196) dialog: 
0) 202) dialog: Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's not funny.
0) 208) dialog: What's the matter? Why didn't you react?
0) 212) dialog: To what? To me, to everything.
0) 217) dialog: Just now. A moment ago.
0) 222) dialog: I don't know what to say. Do you really not know what just happened?
0) 226) dialog: (almost reluctantly bowing his head as he speaks) You were sitting there, staring at me. You didn't answer me when I asked you what the matter was.
0) 229) dialog: I put this tea towel on your face, and you didn't react.
0) 232) dialog: Look... There's still dampness on your collar.
0) 237) dialog: Just now, a few minutes ago.
0) 241) dialog: There's no "So". I went into the bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to get help. 11.
0) 246) dialog: Yes, and then you turned off the tap.
0) 254) dialog: Neither do I.
0) 258) dialog: Don't you think it's best if I call Dr. Bertier?
0) 262) dialog: I don't know. Examine you.
0) 266) dialog: Anne, please!! That's absurd. We can't pretend that nothing happened.
0) 274) dialog: Can you explain how the tea towel got there? 12.
0) 280) dialog: Who turned on the tap?
0) 284) dialog: Can you remember that?
0) 289) dialog: Don't you think it would be better to fetch Dr. Bertier?
0) 308) dialog: What about the children?
0) 312) dialog: What does he do?
0) 316) dialog: Is he good?
0) 320) dialog: That sounds rather derogatory.
0) 325) dialog: And you?
0) 330) dialog: Did you both make up?
0) 334) dialog: Do you love him?
0) 342) dialog: What can I say? The carotid artery was blocked. They did an ultrasound scan, two in fact, and they said they had to operate on her. She was scared. She was confused and scared. You know she has always been afraid of doctors. They said the risk was very low and that if they didn't operate, she'd be certain to have a serious stroke.
0) 346) dialog: Just that it didn't go well. It's one of the 5% that go wrong.
0) 350) dialog: It's pretty upsetting.
0) 353) dialog: Usually at this time, I take a nap. My blood sugar is somewhere down in my socks.
0) 359) dialog: Yeah.
0) 365) dialog: Nothing. It was nice of you to come despite all of your stress.
0) 369) dialog: No, really. There's nothing you can do. We'll see how things go when she's back here in the apartment. We'll manage. Maybe I'll get a caretaker in, or maybe I'll manage on my own. We'll see. We've been through quite a lot in our time, your mother and I.
0) 387) dialog: Here. Thank you very much. It's for both of you. You can just put the things down here. There, beside the window, right. We'll be okay on our own. Thanks a lot.
0) 390) dialog: (to the superintendent) Thank you, Mr. Mery.
0) 394) dialog: Right now everything's fine. I'll let your wife know as soon as we need anything.
0) 407) dialog: Goodbye, Mr. Mery.
0) 413) dialog: (with a nervous smile) Where do you want...
0) 419) dialog: Shall I make some tea?
0) 427) dialog: 
0) 441) dialog: (softly almost to himself) I'm glad you're back.
0) 448) dialog: What?
0) 452) dialog: What?
0) 461) dialog: Anne...
0) 467) dialog: Anne, I...
0) 472) dialog: What can I say, it's...
0) 483) dialog: There.
0) 487) dialog: Everything OK?
0) 499) dialog: I don't feel guilty.
0) 506) dialog: (with a slight smile) OK.
0) 510) dialog: I've already read it.
0) 514) dialog: Do you want it? I'll get it for you.
0) 527) dialog: I thought I'd left it over there in the other room, but I'd already put it away. Tidy people just can't help being tidy.
0) 534) dialog: 
0) 546) dialog: Sure, no problem.
0) 550) dialog: Thank you very much. Keep the change. Thanks.
0) 557) dialog: Yes. I will.
0) 561) dialog: Yes, she's OK. She's recovering.
0) 565) dialog: Yes, we are too. Bye, Mrs. MГ©ry, thanks so much.
0) 586) dialog: ... some banal romance or other about a nobleman and a lower middle- class girl who couldn't have each other and who then, out of sheer magnanimity, decide to renounce their love - in fact I don't quite remember it any more. In any case, afterwards I was thoroughly distraught, and it took me a bit of time to calm down. In the courtyard of the house where grandma lived, there was a young guy at the window who asked me where I'd been. He was a couple of years older than me, a braggart who of course really impressed me. "To the movies", I said, because I was proud that my grandma had given me the money to go all alone to the cinema.
0) 590) dialog: "What did you see?" I started to tell him the story of the movie, and as I did, all the emotion came back. I didn't want to cry in front of the boy, but it was impossible; there I was, crying out loud in the courtyard, and I told him the whole drama to the bitter end.
0) 594) dialog: No idea. He probably found it amusing. I don't remember. I don't remember the film either. But I remember the feeling. That I was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when I was actually watching the film, and that I just couldn't stop.
0) 599) dialog: There are still a few stories you don't know.
0) 603) dialog: 
0) 610) dialog: 
0) 624) dialog: 
0) 628) dialog: Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's funeral.
0) 632) dialog: I fear I must. I don't want to go at all.
0) 636) dialog: Oh, I know a few people who do. Annette can never wait to get all dolled up again. And FranГ§ois has... 26.
0) 641) dialog: (dryly) Nothing, presumably.
0) 646) dialog: Of course.
0) 650) dialog: She was shocked.
0) 654) dialog: (a bit irritated) My God, what are people like when they're shocked? She couldn't believe it, she was speechless. I don't remember any more. In any case, not exactly. I've spoken to a lot of people since.
0) 660) dialog: No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be unkind, but I just don't see the point of talking about it all the time.
0) 666) dialog: No. Sorry.
0) 673) dialog: What ... ?!
0) 689) dialog: Anne...
0) 695) dialog: Yes. 28.
0) 699) dialog: You're always good at surprises.
0) 703) dialog: I didn't come home earlier. I took a taxi. In August, there isn't a lot of traffic.
0) 707) dialog: Anne...!
0) 712) dialog: It was rather bizarre. The priest was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's co-workers made a speech that was embarrassingly emotional. His old secretary came with a radio- cassette player and after the speech she put on "Yesterday" by the Beatles. You can't imagine. Everybody turned round to look at her. Apparently, it wasn't planned. His grandchildren were there. Of course they giggled as soon as the music began. Then the urn was put on a huge stretcher that was obviously designed for a coffin, and out we went into the rain. They placed the urn on a small electric cart that crawled along for what seemed like an eternity to the tiny hole they had dug. A lot of people had to stifle their laughter. It must have been terrible for Jeanne. I have... 29.
0) 718) dialog: You're not inflicting anything on me.
0) 724) dialog: Imagine you were me. Didn't you ever think something like this could happen to one of us?
0) 728) dialog: But things are getting better every day. We'll...
0) 733) dialog: I don't believe you. I know you. You think you're a burden on me. But what if things were the other way around? What would you do then?
0) 747) dialog: (somewhat perplexed, but pleased) Oh hello! Nice to see you.
0) 751) dialog: I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone when I've stored the caller's number and I can see who's calling. Why didn't you leave a message? Anyway, do come in...
0) 756) dialog: Come with me.
0) 769) dialog: Yes, she is. I'll go and get her in a minute. Have a seat.
0) 773) dialog: No, not at all. I'm happy that you came. We were so thrilled by your concert. We hoped we'd see you again soon. Please do have a seat. Can I can get you something? A cup of tea?
0) 777) dialog: Hold on, I'll just freshen up the flowers; in this heat they wilt so fast...
0) 827) dialog: You haven't told us yet what's been going on since the Paris concert.
0) 874) dialog: (shocked, and hence furious) Good God, what are you doing?
0) 877) dialog: Have you lost your senses?! I don't believe it! How stupid!
0) 880) dialog: Look at that! Did you need to do that? Can't you call me when you need something?
0) 884) dialog: 
0) 891) dialog: The lamp is broken too.
0) 900) dialog: Yes? Who's there?
0) 925) dialog: (still with labored breathing) I didn't understand... I thought I'd gone mad... It was something impossible...
0) 934) dialog: Eva. They're coming on the 12th.
0) 939) dialog: No idea. Apparently she's coming with Geoff.
0) 944) dialog: I don't know exactly. What day is it today? I'll go and look.
0) 949) dialog: What?
0) 965) dialog: Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur Laurent, it was beautiful and yet sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes that things will get better. With deep gratitude, your former pupil, Martin.
0) 977) dialog: The family albums? I don't know, there, in the other room. Why?
0) 981) dialog: What, now?
0) 984) dialog: Why, Anne?
0) 994) dialog: (a bit irritated) You're welcome.
0) 999) dialog: (self-consciously, softly) What? 40.
0) 1007) dialog: (caught in the act) I wasn't watching you.
0) 1018) dialog: You're soaked through.
0) 1023) dialog: Hold on.
0) 1026) dialog: I'll be right back.
0) 1030) dialog: It's no big deal. Come on.
0) 1034) dialog: Come on, darling. It's nothing serious. Things like that happen..
0) 1040) dialog: My love. My darling.
0) 1062) dialog: ... three times a week... I'm not experienced enough. We'll see if that's enough.
0) 1066) dialog: It's paid by the hour. We'll see.
0) 1070) dialog: Anne?
0) 1073) dialog: It's hard to say. Sometimes I get the feeling she's totally unaware of the state she's in. And then I feel the opposite. It's... I don't know.
0) 1078) dialog: He's...
0) 1096) dialog: We can't do anything for the moment. Calm down, darling. She's getting medical treatment, they give her the necessary medication, and there are no other options right now.
0) 1100) dialog: She had a second stroke. Bertier examined her and felt we could spare her all the hospital inpatient procedures.
0) 1104) dialog: Anyway, they wouldn't keep her, they'd send her to a care home. What they do in those places, we can do here.
0) 1107) dialog: And she won't be put in a care home. I promised her that.
0) 1111) dialog: Have you got a better idea?
0) 1116) dialog: 
0) 1120) dialog: 
0) 1129) dialog: Now you two had better stop, OK? Another doctor did come. He said Bertier was right. From Monday, a nurse will come three times a week. Now can we talk about something else?
0) 1146) dialog: There, my love, I hope you like it.
0) 1152) dialog: I added a little orange juice. I find it tastes quite good.
0) 1156) dialog: Come on, Anne, you have to eat some more. You've only swallowed three mouthfuls.
0) 1159) dialog: Please, darling. A bit more.
0) 1164) dialog: Yes?
0) 1168) dialog: Mom has no dress for the concert?
0) 1172) dialog: Yes?
0) 1190) dialog: I'll think about it.
0) 1194) dialog: Yes, of course, I'll let you know in the next few days.
0) 1201) dialog: My pleasure. I'll see you out.
0) 1206) dialog: (nodding, softly) I know.
0) 1212) dialog: Goodbye.
0) 1217) dialog: (slowly, softly) I'd like to hire a second nurse. The two could take turns. That would make everything a bit simpler. What do you think?
0) 1228) dialog: Would you mind putting them in the kitchen.
0) 1231) dialog: I'm ba-aack!
0) 1235) dialog: Thanks very much. 49.
0) 1240) dialog: No, thanks, Mr. MГ©ry. You've been a big help.
0) 1247) dialog: I'll let you know if I need you again.
0) 1254) dialog: What is it?
0) 1259) dialog: (taking the mobile phone from the pocket of his jacket) That's very kind of you. Thanks. See you soon.
0) 1263) dialog: I certainly will. Thanks. 50.
0) 1267) dialog: Hello Eva, how are you?... Things are fine.
0) 1272) dialog: (insistently)...Sur le pont ...
0) 1276) dialog: ...Sur le pont...
0) 1280) dialog: ...Sur le pont ... Sur le pont ...
0) 1284) dialog: (smiling to encourage her): ... Sur le pont d'Avignon...
0) 1288) dialog: ... pont... Sur le pont d'Avignon... (he begins to sing): Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse, on y danse, sur le pont d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en rond...
0) 1291) dialog: Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse, on y danse ...
0) 1295) dialog: (singing to encourage Anne, accompanied by the sounds that she produces): Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse, on y danse ... Sur le pont d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en rond ...
0) 1324) dialog: But I've only just found out how incompetent you are.
0) 1329) dialog: I don't want to discuss it with you. Anyway, you wouldn't understand.
0) 1333) dialog: Good for you. (To get rid of her) How much do I owe you?
0) 1340) dialog: Do you have twenty euros? 53.
0) 1346) dialog: Then take the eight hundred euros. You can go now.
0) 1352) dialog: I hope from the bottom of my heart that one day someone treats you the way you treat your patients, and that you too will have no way of defending yourself. Now get out.
0) 1361) dialog: ... Please, open your mouth... go on... open it... Anne! Please!... come on... stop that!...
0) 1364) dialog: If you don't drink, you'll die.
0) 1367) dialog: Is that what you want? 54.
0) 1371) dialog: Come on, Anne, please.
0) 1374) dialog: 
0) 1378) dialog: Anne! ... You can't force me to let you die of thirst. If you persist, I'll call Bertier and he'll put you in hospital. They can force-feed you there. Is that what you want?
0) 1382) dialog: I promised to spare you that. But you must help me. I'm out of my depth.
0) 1385) dialog: Please, Anne!
0) 1388) dialog: Drink that, now!
0) 1391) dialog: There!
0) 1395) dialog: 
0) 1407) dialog: 
0) 1423) dialog: Who's there?
0) 1428) dialog: Eva?
0) 1433) dialog: Just a minute.
0) 1436) dialog: Hello.
0) 1441) dialog: I was in the toilet. Sorry.
0) 1444) dialog: Come in.
0) 1448) dialog: Why this unannounced visit? Where have you come from?
0) 1452) dialog: Nothing. What should be going on? 57.
0) 1458) dialog: Don't you want to sit down first?
0) 1461) dialog: So why are you in Paris?
0) 1465) dialog: Sorry. I didn't listen to it. Forgive me.
0) 1469) dialog: Your worries are no use to me.
0) 1472) dialog: No, don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing you. I just don't have the time to deal with your worries, that's all.
0) 1476) dialog: No. Let's stop this conversation right there. I'm taking care of your mother. It's a full-time job. And I'm not saying that to complain, just to explain why I didn't answer your phone calls and why I don't want to have any pointless discussions on the subject. Your mother is just as could have been expected: bad the whole time.
0) 1480) dialog: She is turning more and more into a helpless child, and it's sad and humiliating, for her and for me. And she doesn't want to be seen in that state either. Even the last time you visited, she didn't want you to come. You two have your own life. Nothing wrong with that. But let us have our life too. Even though it's a lousy one. OK?
0) 1484) dialog: Nothing's the matter; your visit caught me by surprise. And I'm annoyed that you show up here to check that everything's OK. Who do you think you are?
0) 1491) dialog: Stay here, will you!
0) 1494) dialog: (softly, but insistently) Please!
0) 1505) dialog: Please, sit down. 59.
0) 1510) dialog: 
0) 1515) dialog: We do our speech exercises every day, or we sing together. Most of the time, I wake up around 5. At that time, she's still awake. Then we change her incontinence pad. I rub cream on her to avoid sores. Then, around 7, I try to persuade her to eat and drink. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Sometimes she tells me things from her childhood, then for hours she calls for help, and then an instant later she's giggling away to herself, or crying. Nothing of any of that is worth showing to anyone.
0) 1521) dialog: 
0) 1544) dialog: The tea isn't very hot any more.
0) 1547) dialog: But it does make you feel better.
0) 1554) dialog: It was silly of me to lock the door. I'm sorry. You took me by surprise, that's all. I'm sorry.
0) 1559) dialog: (with a little ironic laugh) What's going to happen now? The nurse comes twice a week, and every two weeks Dr. Bertier and the hairdresser come. That's what you want to know, right? Things will go on as they have done up until now. They'll go from bad to worse. Things will go on, and then one day it will all be over.
0) 1564) dialog: Can't I? What do you suggest?
0) 1568) dialog: What do you call "a serious talk"? What do you want to suggest? Do you want to have Mom live with you? Do you want to pack her off to a care home? Do you? What do you want? Go on, talk to me "seriously"!
0) 1577) dialog: 
0) 1582) dialog: (unable to keep from laughing a little) Yes. I think I was pretty uptight.
0) 1601) dialog: (trying to calm her like a sick child) What is it?..
0) 1605) dialog: Are you in pain?... What's the matter?... Is your pad full?
0) 1608) dialog: No... So what's hurting you?
0) 1611) dialog: It's all right... it's all right ... I'm here... everything's fine... we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a story... but you must be quiet, I can't talk too loud, it wears me out... Here we go: when I was little... well, I wasn't as little as all that... it was toward the end of primary school, so I was about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a holiday camp. They thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age... We were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape... I think it was in the Auvergne... I don't know... in any case it was the opposite of what I'd expected... We had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim. Not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream. We entered it running, in a double file. You know, I was never very sporty. They had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... But the worst thing was the food. The third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice pudding. We sat at long tables in a huge hall. I didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: You won't get up until you've cleared your plate. So after the meal everybody left the room, and I remained seated, in tears. I had made a secret pact with Mom. I was to send her a postcard every week.
0) 1615) dialog: If I was pleased with the place I was to draw some flowers on it, or if not, some stars. She kept the card; it was covered all over in stars. After three hours, I was allowed to leave the table. I went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees. It was diphtheria. They took me to the nearest hospital where I was put in an isolation ward, which meant that Mom, when she came to visit me, could only wave at me through a window. At some point I lost that postcard. It's a pity.
