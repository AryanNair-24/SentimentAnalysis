WENDY BERGMAN (senior, 17, beautiful but not ready to accept it) walks through the “Coop” private school grounds; she leads us under banners that say “WELCOME NEW CLASS” and “DON’T DIS THE ORIENTATION -- HAVE FUN AND WELCOME!” It all feels like it could be the Summer of Love except for the girls are wearing Seven jeans and the guys are wearing vintage and everyone’s hair is done, even the ‘alternative’ kids. Wendy passes by as a group of fifty students does a ‘lap sit’ -- they stand in a circle and then sit down at the same time. Eventually they fall amid general hysterical laughter. If Wendy wasn’t rolling her eyes before, she certainly is now. ACROSS THE QUAD we meet BILLIE (17, short blond hair and vintage clothes, hottest girl in school according to current web polls). She is walking towards Wendy; she is blond to Wendy’s brunette, intelligent enthusiasm to Wendy’s brilliant sarcasm. They are a perfect match for each other. A car pulls up quickly between them as they near the parking lot. It squeals to a stop and SEAN MAYER (17, tall with good looks that skew slightly pretty) gets out of the car. The car squeals away. If it looks like the opening of the Breakfast Club, well, all the better. He skulks towards the orientation festivities but he also steals a glance at Wendy. Billie yells out to Wendy:
1) 1) dialog: Woman! Wendy jogs the last few feet to her best friend and then they join the rest of the group. Besides Billie there is ANN, Chinese with a defiant red streak in her hair; JONAH a stoner reading a Miles Davis biography; 11/4/05 3. ROBERT, tall and the most conventionally good looking of the unconventional group and PRICE who has blond hair and blue eyes and wants desperately to fit in. Which is why he pulls out, and places on his head, a TRUCKER’S CAP. The GROUP GROANS.
1) 3) dialog: You should burn that hat.
1) 5) dialog: He could burn a little of it Symbolically. She jumps up, fishing a lighter from her bag. She hands the hat and the lighter to Price.
1) 6) dialog: Do it. Show us you’re better than the hat. The group looks at Wendy, asking for permission.
1) 9) dialog: What?! 11/4/05 4. Freshmen Girl points to Wendy’s necklace, which reads “Hoochie”.
1) 14) dialog: (to Wendy) You okay?
1) 16) dialog: Call me later?
1) 20) dialog: You’ve never blown a rock star.
1) 22) dialog: What if you could blow a rock star?
1) 24) dialog: That’s my girl. Wendy waves at Billie as she joins the others and walks off. Wendy is all alone outside the school. She wanders around, kicking a few pebbles, she picks a leaf froma tree and starts humming the theme to “The A-Team.” Wendy goes back inside the school.
6) 12) dialog: He seems a little too Queer Eye and not enough Straight Guy.
6) 14) dialog: He’s nice? 11/4/05 13.
6) 16) dialog: Your brother is easy to be nice to. Like puppy dogs and homeless people.
6) 18) dialog: I’m not the one making him out like Sean the Saint.
6) 22) dialog: For me too.
10) 0) text: Wendy grabs the three Diet Cokes, frantic, almost dropping them. She runs upstairs. INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - NIGHT 21 Billie and Ann are looking out the window at the car; Wendy rushes in and looks over their shoulders to see Sean.
11) 1) dialog: No shit.
12) 1) dialog: No.
12) 6) dialog: Are we getting ready or what? INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 26 Later that night, the three girls are in Wendy’s bathroom. 27 11/4/05 18. They have done their makeup and hair for a Saturday night, not too slutty, not too conservative. They look average, all-American, Midwestern. The girls look into the mirror into each other’s eyes smiling. N.E.R.D.’s song “Truth or Dare” starts playing. The SOUND OF A LOUD PARTY.
14) 16) dialog: He’s funny!
14) 18) dialog: Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan. They laugh.
14) 20) dialog: (to Ann, of the boxes) You putting in or taking out?
14) 22) dialog: You always take out. I’m surprised that box isn’t empty.
14) 24) dialog: Why?
14) 29) dialog: Like you know anything about karma. You should be worried about the yin and yang of that box.
14) 31) dialog: You stole that marble because someone- -
14) 33) dialog: Right, Lisa Nishi, told you that you could sit with her if you did.
14) 36) dialog: Who the hell plays with marbles anyway? It’s so dipshitty 1957. Price shrugs.
14) 50) dialog: Yes baby, it is.
14) 52) dialog: That was a gift.
14) 55) dialog: You’re freaking hysterical.
14) 68) dialog: We have to stop using that word, “cute.” Bunnies are cute. Men are sexy.
14) 70) dialog: They will be. She rolls over so she is looking at Wendy.
14) 71) dialog: They’11 be our men. Ten years from now they’1l be the strongest, smartest men anyone knows. And they’1l be ours.
14) 73) dialog: Why not? After all you invested? This is almost 17 years of training, of learning. You want to start from scratch? 11/4/05 27.
14) 75) dialog: (nonplussed) You’1l see. We’re all going to college together. And then get houses next door As if to prove her point, Billie grabs Price by the knees as he walks by; he falls on the floor. Then she straddles him. He tries to get up.
14) 77) dialog: (teasing) Sorry, kids. It’s Saturday night and rules are rules. Without rules we would die.
14) 80) dialog: You have, like, sixteen split ends.
14) 83) dialog: Shhh. This is the best time. This is the time I don’t think about things like college. Just-- Wendy gets it, and they return to the silence.
14) 84) dialog: (looking at her watch) It’s Sunday.
22) 0) text: Wendy, Price and Robert find Billie eating a big bag of Doritos. Billie sits opposite Ryan and Aaron in the lounge, a wordless face-off. A small crowd is gathering, though they try to be casual. Ryan isn’t saying anything, she’s trying to focus on Aaron. And she looks like she might cry.
22) 1) dialog: (to Ryan) Doritos?
22) 3) dialog: we’re leaving?
22) 5) dialog: (nonchalant ) Okay. We can go to a “thing”.
22) 7) dialog: That too. Billie finally looks away from Ryan and smiles her Cheshire Cat Grin. Wendy pulls her away.
22) 9) dialog: (loud enough for Ryan to hear) I’m just making sure our little housewife is being a good girl. Wendy looks back at Ryan, who is clearly upset by the almost -confrontation.
22) 10) dialog: What do I always say to you?
22) 12) dialog: After a soap opera. Don’t name children after soap operas. How many times do I have to tell you people? Wendy and Billie laugh. Price and Robert come back up to the two of them, now that the moment has passed.
22) 14) dialog: She didn’t have to do anything. I’m as harmless as a kitten. Robert nuzzles Billie’s neck while “meowing into it,” Price takes Wendy’s hand and kisses it gently. They find Ann and Jonah waiting for them and walk outside.
24) 0) text: Billie is sitting by herself waiting for Ann and Wendy. The two Tank-Top Girls sit nearby.
24) 6) dialog: I like how you two dress alike. I was thinking of getting some working girls for my brother’s bachelor party and you two could be like a twin act. They’d love it. You guys are what, ten bucks an hour? Or do you just take food stamps? A pause.
24) 8) dialog: Alright fine! I’11 pay in crack. God hookers are so picky these days. The girls are gone, and Billie smiles to herself.
29) 21) dialog: And we’re stupid.
29) 24) dialog: (looks at the clock) Shit. I gotta go. (to Wendy) You’1l drive me? Wendy rolls her eyes and Billie spanks her playfully. INT. WENDY’S CAR: DRIVING - NIGHT 48 Wendy drives Billie home, Billie is still working on her homework in the passenger seat
29) 26) dialog: For next year? I don’t know, five maybe.
29) 28) dialog: Six or seven.
29) 30) dialog: Yeah. Jonah’1l get in wherever he wants. But he’1l go where we go.
29) 32) dialog: Why? The car cruises by the Brown Sedan, rocking, fogged up windows.
29) 34) dialog: Agreed. Wendy watches the car out her back window.
32) 30) dialog: I missed you.
32) 32) dialog: Listen, don’t ever fake it. Right? 56 11/4/05 54.
32) 34) dialog: Cause faking it is for dumbass girls who hook-up with the first guy in baggy jeans and a earth-fucking SUV.
32) 36) dialog: We are not those girls. You are not that girl.
32) 39) dialog: You’re...ummmm. You’re (she can’t say whatever it is she wants to say, so she makes a joke) A Very Bad Girl.
32) 41) dialog: ...and When she was good she was very very good and when she was bad she was horrid. Billie leaves her hand on Wendy’s face. Then Wendy leans on Billie’s knee and holds on. INT. MAYER HOUSE: SEAN’S ROOM - NIGHT 56 Sean is sound asleep in his bed when the window opens. Wendy pulls herself in, falling and making a loud thud. Sean wakes up.
36) 0) text: As Wendy gets into the room she sees Billie and Ann and sits between them. 11/4/05 60. Billie reaches out and grabs the skin on Wendy’s elbow. It doesn’t really hurt, but it quietly gets Wendy’s attention.
36) 2) dialog: You have something you want to tell me?
36) 6) dialog: They were laughing at you, Allyson. You need to learn how it works, Al. That little man in the canoe down there won’t help himself, you know. At least the guys I sleep with know what to do.
36) 8) dialog: Jesus. You give new meaning to the word “meaningless sex” you know? I don’t mean the act. I mean the gender. Without meaning.
36) 11) dialog: I believe Allyson just referred to us as skanks. At least that’s what I heard.
36) 13) dialog: Women. We want to be referred to as women. The teacher turns around but the girls are sitting, quietly. Ann winks at Allyson.
36) 14) dialog: (whispers to Wendy) I better not have seen what I just saw. Did I see that?
36) 16) dialog: We’1l die without you. You know that.
36) 19) dialog: Don’t worry about it. 63 11/4/05 62. Billie gives Allyson a last glare and then looks down, contemplating her plan. INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - DAY 63 Wendy and Sean are kissing, half undressed. Wendy moves toward Sean but misjudges the distance on the narrow bed and starts to slip off. Sean tries to grab at her, but she falls. Wendy is laughing hysterically. Sean goes to help her up and she pulls him off the bed.
40) 47) dialog: She won’t do it, will she? Everyone stops. Wendy stands up but doesn’t leave.
40) 48) dialog: You thinking of running away? Maybe we should try that whole fantasy thing Jonah was talking about. Hold you down, make you scream.
40) 50) dialog: You have no idea what it means if she leaves right now.
40) 56) dialog: We can’t fucking stop. Billie stands up.
40) 57) dialog: We don’t stop, we don’t turn back
40) 59) dialog: Fuck you. Billie advances on Wendy, she isn’t wearing her underwear and that seems to make her bolder.
40) 60) dialog: Look at me. Look at you. We’re seventeen. We’ll never look like this again. Our bodies want it, we want it.
40) 63) dialog: Original. The guys keep them separated but Billie is still fighting.
40) 65) dialog: You either do Jonah right now, or you are so completely gone.
40) 69) dialog: I’m not kidding you. Jonah backs away and Robert grabs Billie, giving Wendy a chance to break free.
40) 71) dialog: Shut up Ann.
40) 73) dialog: You all shut up. Wendy breaks free and moves towards Billie.
40) 74) dialog: You gonna go home and cry to your boyfriend about how you almost cheated on him?
44) 0) text: Sean follows Wendy into the school, then throws his arm around her. Across the lounge, Wendy sees Billie and Ann, fighting. Billie grabs Ann’s arm, almost shaking her, she’s furious. Ann pulls away, and walks towards Wendy, who separates from Sean. Wendy and Ann face each other, but instead of talking to Wendy, Ann just stands in front of her, crying. There is a long pause as Wendy and Ann look at each other.
51) 18) dialog: What are you doing?
51) 20) dialog: Fuck her. Ann keeps crying.
51) 21) dialog: What is wrong with you? Ann opens the car door and tries to leave. Her seatbelt is still on. She removes it and then runs from the car, leaving the door open. Billie reaches over and slams the door shut.
51) 22) dialog: Fuck you, too. Billie sits there, watching Robert’s house.
53) 0) text: Wendy gets to her locker, then realizes that Billie is standing nearby. Wendy doesn’t look at her right away.
53) 1) dialog: Your friends, all of us, we don’t want to let you go. And we won’t do it.
53) 3) dialog: If you were a mom, and your kid was about to lose a limb, wouldn’t you, I don’t know, fight to keep it?
53) 5) dialog: But we feel it is. 11/4/05 91.
53) 7) dialog: Yeah.
53) 9) dialog: I think your queer ass boyfriend would really dig this, huh? I was thinking of putting it in his locker. A little after- track-practice surprise. Wendy goes for it but Billie is faster and she holds onto the box.
53) 11) dialog: I think he’s gonna like the pictures from this summer especially. Billie opens her mouth very wide and does a pretty good oral sex simulation. Wendy remains calm.
53) 13) dialog: And the ones of you on all fours. I mean, it probably makes more sense in context, you know, with the pictures of all of us, but still-- 89 90 11/4/05 92. Wendy grabs the box from Billie’s unsuspecting hands marches over to Sean’s locker, takes her car keys and easily pries open the weak metal. The locker opens and she shoves the box in. Then she closes it again.
53) 15) dialog: Not so far.
53) 17) dialog: I was thinking of teaching your brother how to kiss. You know, train him up right. For future generations of Coop chicks. Wendy lunges at her but Billie moves away quickly and Wendy lets her go.
57) 24) dialog: You remember Miss Hise’s class? Wendy smiles, carefully. 11/4/05 102.
57) 26) dialog: She carried those bookbags.
57) 28) dialog: And then in third grade, when my parents split up, and I decided, I don’t know why, to do a dance, from that movie, Flashdance. You remember?
57) 30) dialog: (laughing with her) I can see the third grade me, and she’s getting up to do that dance, and I want to tell her to stop. I’m embarrassed right now, just talking about it. Their laughter fades but the moment was real.
57) 31) dialog: Your friends, all of us, we don’t want to let you go. Wendy doesn’t respond right away.
57) 33) dialog: That I won’t be so evil?
57) 36) dialog: Yeah. Me too. 95 96 11/4/05 103.
57) 38) dialog: You gotta do one thing though.
58) 0) text: No sound. Billie and Wendy walk toward the school, Wendy is looking ahead of her, Billie is looking at Wendy. At first we see them close up and then we are inside the school, watching them as they walk towards the front glass doors, and when they finally get there, and they open them, we hear the chatter and background of the school again.
59) 0) text: Billie and Wendy stand in front of Ryan, Aaron and Sean. The milling stops. Everyone stares. There’s a long incredibly uncomfortable pause.
59) 1) dialog: Hi! Wendy doesn’t say anything.
59) 2) dialog: Wwe’re scaring you?
59) 4) dialog: Well, gosh, we’re sorry. (to Wendy) Do it.
59) 6) dialog: (to Wendy) Do it. Ryan looks stricken. 11/4/05 104.
59) 8) dialog: It was Uncle Bob.
59) 10) dialog: (can’t resist) That dear old Uncle Bob liked to touch her. And that one time he actually had her for a whole weekend.
59) 13) dialog: Everything? (smiles broadly) Aaron, did you know that Ryan here. She liked it. She liked the pain. She liked to be held down and forced. Made her all-- Billie turns to Wendy.
59) 15) dialog: What did it make her? Wendy? Wendy takes a deep breath, then turns to Billie.
59) 21) dialog: (almost a growl) Stop.
63) 0) text: The House Party, with the porn, the drinking, the girls making out with other girls. Ann is giving a guy a pole dance with a blank look on her face. We track through the same party, and the Tank-Top Girl #1 from the first party pulls Price into a bedroom. INT. BILLIE’S HOUSE: ROOM - NIGHT 102 Billie has the box open in front of her but we don’t see her face, as she sits on the floor of her room. Laid out on the floor, encircling her, are various mementos. She lays each one out carefully, in some order we are not privy to. She smooths a few pictures, she carefully places a lighter next to an old license plate. As we circle the items, we catch a passing glimpse of Billie, who might be crying.
