WENDY BERGMAN (senior, 17, beautiful but not ready to accept it) walks through the “Coop” private school grounds; she leads us under banners that say “WELCOME NEW CLASS” and “DON’T DIS THE ORIENTATION -- HAVE FUN AND WELCOME!” It all feels like it could be the Summer of Love except for the girls are wearing Seven jeans and the guys are wearing vintage and everyone’s hair is done, even the ‘alternative’ kids. Wendy passes by as a group of fifty students does a ‘lap sit’ -- they stand in a circle and then sit down at the same time. Eventually they fall amid general hysterical laughter. If Wendy wasn’t rolling her eyes before, she certainly is now. ACROSS THE QUAD we meet BILLIE (17, short blond hair and vintage clothes, hottest girl in school according to current web polls). She is walking towards Wendy; she is blond to Wendy’s brunette, intelligent enthusiasm to Wendy’s brilliant sarcasm. They are a perfect match for each other. A car pulls up quickly between them as they near the parking lot. It squeals to a stop and SEAN MAYER (17, tall with good looks that skew slightly pretty) gets out of the car. The car squeals away. If it looks like the opening of the Breakfast Club, well, all the better. He skulks towards the orientation festivities but he also steals a glance at Wendy. Billie yells out to Wendy:
1) 7) dialog: Burn a little. It’1ll be good for you. Price burns a little of the hat, sheepishly, and the group all cheer. Price leans over to hug the girls and it quickly turns into a wrestling/play fight. Wendy looks up and sees a FRESHMEN GIRL and guy whispering and looking at the group’s antics. Wendy stands up, brushing herself off. WENDY (CONT’D) Sorry.
1) 13) dialog: (motioning out to the field) Can’t. My brother’s here.
1) 15) dialog: Yep.
1) 17) dialog: Frigging right. All six hug, with real warmth. Somebody yells out to them from a passing car.
1) 19) dialog: Seriously, when did being a lesbian become cooler than blowing a rock star?
1) 21) dialog: Neither have you. 11/4/05 5. They laugh. The other four are a little ways away, but Billie hangs on to Wendy for a second.
1) 23) dialog: And ruin what we have? Billie slaps Wendy’s ass.
2) 0) text: The school is empty, a little eerie. Still humming, Wendy heads towards the classrooms, which are all ina large hangar type building -- each classroom is divided with partitions into a “bay”. In the center is a library and at the far corner, a SCIENCE classroom.
3) 0) text: Inside the science area, Wendy opens a door removing ETHANOL. Pouring the ethanol into a wide-mouthed beaker she places the leaf in the ethanol, lights a Bunsen burner and lets the leaf start to boil in the solution. Sean watches, unseen by Wendy.
3) 2) dialog: Did you follow me in here?
3) 4) dialog: The “lay of the land”.
3) 6) dialog: There’s not much to memorize. She turns him around and points out the “landmarks” of school.
3) 7) dialog: These are the classrooms. No walls, so you have to have respect for everyone. That’s a big word around here -- respect. Make sure you use it inappropriately.
3) 9) dialog: That would be “incorrectly.” Wendy points out some more places in the school.
3) 10) dialog: That’s the library. We gather in the lounge for announcements every Thursday for Community Meeting; better known as “where people bitch about the lack of respect in the public bathrooms”.
3) 12) dialog: Get the lights. She gestures to the other side of the room. Sean runs to the switch, hits it. The sun has started to set, so the room is relatively dark. Wendy turns the Bunsen burner off. The leaf GLOWS BRIGHT RED. 11/4/05 7. WENDY (CONT’D) I just read about it and I wanted to try it. The electrons in the leaf are ‘excited’. They have these names that are so... Human. Excited. Lazy. Aggressive. Did you know they can be “impure”?
3) 14) dialog: I hate chemistry.
3) 16) dialog: Shhh.
3) 18) dialog: Who would you tell? He’s stung, but hides it.
3) 20) dialog: (indignant, he’s hit close to home ) If you did I’d kick your ass.
3) 22) dialog: That’s incorrect.
3) 24) dialog: No, but it would be disrespectful. 11/4/05 8. A pause as she looks at Sean. He smiles at her. She tries not to smile back but she does.
3) 26) dialog: My brother, Nathan.

4) 10) dialog: I’m going in, okay?
4) 12) dialog: I’m good. Thanks.
4) 16) dialog: Why’d you ask him over for Saturday?
6) 7) dialog: He’s from Chicago.
6) 9) dialog: I guess. People transfer.
6) 11) dialog: So?
6) 13) dialog: (a little too quickly) He’s not. He’s nice.
6) 15) dialog: He was nice to Nathan.
6) 20) dialog: Thank god we’re not normal. Wendy goes to the door.

8) 0) text: Wendy walks toward the voice, seeing Sean in the back foyer, standing in front of an open garbage can. He has an apple core, which he can’t throw away because the garbage is overflowing.
8) 1) dialog: Yeah. I was supposed to take that out. 19 11/4/05 14.
8) 3) dialog: I’1l get it. Wendy takes the garbage bag out of the garbage and ties it shut.
8) 5) dialog: Sure. He takes the bag and follows her to the backyard.
9) 0) text: They walk to the six trashcans that line up on the property line between their houses. Sean’s backyard is littered with boxes. Wendy opens a trashcan and Sean places the bag inside. As he does, his hand touches hers for a moment, and she catches his eye.
9) 1) dialog: You were sweet to come by.
9) 3) dialog: He’s temporarily weird. Proof that phases are real. Wendy absently wipes her hand on her pants.
9) 5) dialog: Huh? Yeah. You know when you touch something gross? Sean looks down at his own hand. 11/4/05 15.
9) 6) dialog: (laughs) Oh god, no -- not you. I’m sorry. I meant the garbage.
9) 8) dialog: I should go in. They don’t move, just stand there for another moment.
9) 10) dialog: Amazing line. Brilliant.
9) 12) dialog: Well, if you’re calling me weird in earnest, that’s pretty mean.
9) 14) dialog: Pick me up? What are you from, 1976?
9) 16) dialog: No I’m not.
9) 18) dialog: Those are all words that mean ugly. 20 21 22 11/4/05 16.
9) 20) dialog: I can’t-- I mean, I’m not...
9) 22) dialog: (not moving) I’m not available. If you didn’t find that out at orientation, you’1l definitely find it out soon. From in front of the houses the sound of a horn honking interrupts them; Sean and Wendy stay still for one moment longer, but then Sean realizes who it is.
10) 0) text: Wendy grabs the three Diet Cokes, frantic, almost dropping them. She runs upstairs. INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - NIGHT 21 Billie and Ann are looking out the window at the car; Wendy rushes in and looks over their shoulders to see Sean.

12) 3) dialog: (trying to remain aloof) That was fast.
12) 5) dialog: (changing the subject) That car has been there every night this week. A foot sticks out of the passenger window. The girls laugh. Billie goes back to the bed, but Wendy keeps looking out the window.
14) 18) dialog: Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan. They laugh.
14) 32) dialog: -- Lisa Nishi--
14) 37) dialog: I’d torture at least one Olsen.
14) 39) dialog: I would. She would be so spunky and then she'd break...it would be totally delicious. (to Ann) Why? wWho’d you torture?
14) 42) dialog: Yeah. In. Putting in.
14) 44) dialog: Crying?
14) 53) dialog: You’re always saying you don’t want us to apologize. Well, I don’t want us to bea joke. It’s not funny. Everyone thinks about that for a second.
14) 67) dialog: Price got really cute this summer. Billie lays back, her head in Ann’s lap.
14) 69) dialog: These aren’t men.
14) 72) dialog: In ten years, I’m not gonna be here.
14) 74) dialog: (upset) You’re kidding right? What, we’re gonna buy a big house in Utah?
14) 81) dialog: Shut up. They sit in silence, looking out on the suburban street everyone asleep, the gray hazy light of pre-dawn.
14) 82) dialog: When we get to college--
14) 85) dialog: Yeah, you’re a freaking genius. Shut up we’re supposed to be having quiet Zen time. Billie thwacks Wendy lightly, and the girls giggle, and return to silence.
17) 0) text: Wendy comes into the kitchen. Wearing low-slung jeans and a sweater, she looks relatively tame. Wendy grabs some orange juice. ABBY BERGMAN (40’s, dresses mostly in caftans and wears a lot of ethnic jewelry) drinks coffee.
17) 3) dialog: Mommm.
17) 6) dialog: I can’t eat that stuff. Abby doesn’t say anything. Nathan takes a piece for himself, eats it quickly and washes it down with milk from the container.
17) 7) dialog: Now can we go?
17) 10) dialog: You worried I won’t clean up okay? That I’1l embarrass you?
17) 12) dialog: (earnest) Mom, honestly. You could do so much better. Nathan and Wendy leave, Abby sits alone in the kitchen for a moment, her shoulders sagging.

18) 12) dialog: So why not be a little gay? For me.
19) 7) dialog: Well?
20) 1) dialog: Hi. My brother was supposed to ask you if Sean needed a ride. To school.
20) 3) dialog: I think he was dropped on his head a lot. My brother. Not your son. Helen laughs. 11/4/05 33.
20) 7) dialog: It’s not a problem. An awkward pause.
20) 9) dialog: Sean said you’re a scientist?
20) 12) dialog: Nothing. You nervous?
21) 0) text: The car pulls into the school parking lot. Nathan gets out of the car and heads inside but Sean doesn’t move. Wendy is about to say something when she sees Robert and Jonah pulling up and she panics.
21) 1) dialog: (cold) Okay kid. Your taxi ride is over.
21) 3) dialog: Unless you plan on paying me. The ride is over.

21) 8) dialog: He was in a hurry, I guess.
22) 0) text: Wendy, Price and Robert find Billie eating a big bag of Doritos. Billie sits opposite Ryan and Aaron in the lounge, a wordless face-off.

22) 2) dialog: You ready?
22) 4) dialog: Senior class meeting? And then some other thing.
22) 6) dialog: Actually, “some other thing”. 11/4/05 36.

25) 7) dialog: It’s Promethean.
25) 9) dialog: (to Sean) If you’re going to help him out, you might as well really help him out. (to the class) Promethean. Not Sisyphian. (a pause) Not everything said here has merit. The Teacher doesn’t know what to say. Wendy smiles at Sean. Then she looks at Jonah, who hasn’t glanced up from the book he is reading.
29) 20) dialog: (teasing) Cause words is hard.
29) 22) dialog: I thought Asian people loved physics.

He picks up a book, throws it in the corner. There is a thud and then a second lighter thud. Sean's confused. He picks up another book, does it again. A thud, and then another thud, softer. Sean picks up a book, and doesn't throw it down. A small, soft thud. Sean looks around, another thud, coming from the window. He opens the window shade. Wendy is outside, slowly dribbling the basketball purposefully in his backyard.
31) 0) text: Wendy tries to make a shot, and misses.
31) 2) dialog: It’s not possible. To be with me. Really. She holds the ball.
31) 3) dialog: (suddenly nervous) You do want to be with me, right? Sean steals the ball and then dribbles slowly, trying to get the slowest dribble possible, concentrating to control his frustration.
31) 5) dialog: That girl, Ryan? She was one of my best friends. And now I don’t talk to her ever.
31) 7) dialog: Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I saw him naked a whole lot. But that’s different. I mean, he could just be an ex-boyfriend, right? You have ex-girlfriends, don’t you?
31) 9) dialog: Yeah, I know you don’t. You don’t really know anything about me, do you? Wendy steals the ball back, dribbles, does a lay-up and misses.
31) 11) dialog: (re. missed basket) You mean, since I'm so naturally athletic? (Sean rolls his eyes, Wendy dribbles again, not looking at him) You haven’t even asked if it is true.
31) 13) dialog: I don’t live in that world--
31) 15) dialog: No. You, jackass. Of disposable girlfriends. Of blowjobs for bracelets. Of macking and hooking up and going down and text-messaging some asshole who will cum all over my shirt. That world. Sean retrieves the ball, and starts his slow meticulous dribble.
31) 17) dialog: I have a pretty good idea.
31) 19) dialog: Ahh yes. Fairytale land. The land of make believe.
31) 21) dialog: (sarcastic) You’re going to rescue me? You and me against the world?
31) 23) dialog: (teasing him) What was that?
31) 25) dialog: Did you just sigh?
31) 27) dialog: You sighed. Like a girl in a romance novel.
31) 29) dialog: 
31) 32) dialog: Maybe.
32) 2) dialog: Price?
32) 4) dialog: What?
32) 6) dialog: I’m not. Price comes out of the bathroom. He has dyed his formerly surfer blond hair black and possibly gotten extensions so that he has a forelock of hair in front of his eyes. He has one a smallish vintage t-shirt and cords instead of his normal clothes (which weren’t so super trendy). He looks like an Emo boy from a Bright Eyes concert.
32) 7) dialog: Your hair.
32) 9) dialog: I just --
32) 11) dialog: Yes.
32) 13) dialog: Being ignored is not the high school revenge you think it is. She comes up behind Price and hugs him from behind. He turns around and they embrace.
32) 15) dialog: I think I said cuter.
32) 17) dialog: (looking at him) You did. You lost weight or got in shape or something.
32) 19) dialog: What?
32) 21) dialog: I don’t understand. You got a nose job? Price just smiles at her, and goes back to the mirror. Wendy stands on tiptoes and looks at his face carefully, coming kissing close, then kisses Price on the lips. He pulls away.
32) 23) dialog: Right.
32) 25) dialog: (shocked) About your nose? Nice.
32) 27) dialog: You wanna walk over to Robert’s with me?
32) 29) dialog: Beer? Billie passes it to her.
32) 31) dialog: I just didn’t have any-- I didn’t want to.
32) 33) dialog: Right.
32) 35) dialog: Seriously.
32) 37) dialog: Yeah. There’s a pause.
32) 38) dialog: What kind of girl am I?
32) 40) dialog: Seriously... What kind? Billie takes a lock of Wendy’s hair and makes a curl on her forehead.
32) 43) dialog: (softly) I don’t know what I’m doing here. Sean kisses her and Wendy immediately goes for his pants. He takes her hands, kisses each finger and then stops there.
32) 45) dialog: Good. She drifts off to sleep. INT. MAYER HOUSE: SEAN’S ROOM - NIGHT 57 Sean and Wendy are naked, their bodies close, their eyes open, looking at each other. Wendy looks away for a second and Sean immediately gets her gaze back. Sean is careful but passionate and Wendy is taking it all in. Her gaze wanders again.

34) 3) dialog: Stop it. Wendy pulls Sean into a nearby storage closet, unaware that across the hall BILLIE SEES HER GO IN THERE WITH SEAN. Billie stops, Ann doesn’t notice that she has stopped and keeps walking -- Billie isn’t confused. She’s angry.

35) 6) dialog: Come on. Seven months. You can’t wait for me?
35) 8) dialog: You want what your parents have, don’t you?

35) 11) dialog: Meet me this afternoon?
35) 13) dialog: Please.

36) 1) dialog: What the hell?
36) 3) dialog: (playing it off) I stole some french fries from you yesterday at lunch. Billie pulls, harder and is about to retort when:
36) 15) dialog: No. Billie grabs Wendy’s arm a little to hard, a moment that is part violent, part desperate.
36) 17) dialog: I have to go to the bathroom. (trying a joke) You can live without me for a minute, right? Wendy slips from Billie’s grasp and walks out of the classroom.
36) 21) dialog: You didn’t land on your butt
36) 23) dialog: It wasn’t that bad. She reaches over and slaps Sean on the ass.

36) 27) dialog: Oh. Sorry.
36) 29) dialog: No. Hit me for real.
36) 31) dialog: Hit me for real. I want to feel what it’s like to be spanked for real.
36) 33) dialog: I’m telling you it’s okay. You’re not gonna hurt me if I tell you it’s okay.
36) 35) dialog: Nobody ever spanked me. Not once.
36) 37) dialog: (half playing) You have to. Sometimes they’re bad and they have to learn. I never learned. Hit me. Sean won’t do it so Wendy hits him on the arm. And then the leg. She smacks his face. Sean does nothing. Then he pounces on her, turns her over and spanks her He stops.
36) 39) dialog: Do it again. wWhy’d you stop?
36) 41) dialog: (pissed off) I’m not abnormal. 11/4/05 64.

36) 61) dialog: Are we talking or spanking? Sean hits Wendy hard, harder than he has before.
36) 62) dialog: Shit. Ow. Everyone has to be into it. We all have to agree and some people don’t like to get spanked, I guess.
36) 64) dialog: We have rules now?
36) 66) dialog: Don’t call it a club!
36) 68) dialog: We’re friends. We’ve known each other since we were in elementary school. I love them. Sean smacks her, three times. Wendy finally loses her temper and pulls herself up and away from him.
36) 70) dialog: You make it sound perverted. Calling it a club.
36) 72) dialog: I never worry. Like about if I’m pretty, or sexy. I never worry about parties or being alone -- cause we love each other. And I know you think it’s weird, or whorish. But my friends are cool people.
36) 74) dialog: So? I like sleeping with you too. And you’re never gonna make me feel like they do. A pause and then Sean moves towards her, but she backs away .

Billie watches Wendy closely as each couple is making out. Wendy is trying to focus on Jonah but she feels awkward, she keeps sitting, pulling her hair off her face. Jonah is trying to keep in the moment, but something is off, he knows it. She puts her hand down on him and then pulls it away. She sits up, then re-settles.
40) 61) dialog: I don’t want it. Billie storms over to Wendy and hits her hard with a closed fist. Suddenly the guys are pulling them apart, not before Wendy hits back, just as viciously.
40) 62) dialog: You bitch.
40) 66) dialog: Excuse me?

41) 1) dialog: Hey there!
41) 3) dialog: (to girl) That’s your boyfriend, right? (the girl says “Yes.” Wendy keeps going) You’re dating and all couply and you love him and he loves you and you’re thinking about babies and marriage or maybe Marriage and then babies or like a house and some furniture, right?
41) 5) dialog: (to girl) You know what’s totally fucked up? That you never hear anybody say that they are a girlfriend. They’re “my girlfriend.” That’s my dog, or that’s my car.
41) 7) dialog: (to Girl) You’re pathetic. You’re like this barely conscious amoeba willing to give away your identity for a penis to call your own. Wendy suddenly slams the door in the guy’s face.

There is a long pause as Wendy and Ann look at each other.
45) 0) text: Wendy stands in the bathroom, trying to catch her breath and calm down. She looks in the mirror, pushes her hair forward so she can hide behind it. She gives herself a moment and then turns to go but standing in her way is Ryan.

45) 3) dialog: Where’s Aaron? Wendy takes a step forward but Ryan doesn’t move and Wendy stops. There’s a pause and then Ryan throws her arms dramatically around Wendy. WENDY (CONT’D) Jesus. Ryan pulls away violently and holds Wendy at arms length.

53) 4) dialog: I don’t think this is the same thing.
53) 6) dialog: (starting to get angry) You’re speaking for everyone now?
53) 8) dialog: I don’t believe you. I think this is you, being lost and frightened and you don’t know what else to do. Billie doesn’t respond, she just reaches into the bag and pulls out WENDY’S BOX from Robert’s house. She drops it on the ground in front of Wendy.
53) 10) dialog: (calmly as possible) You know what? Go ahead. It doesn’t work like that with us. Even better, why don’t you give it to him in class. Because even if you posted it on the internet and took out billboards, he wouldn’t care.
53) 12) dialog: Do it then. Don’t talk about it.
53) 14) dialog: He wants me and that kills you.

56) 2) dialog: --okay. Wendy shoots a basket, it bounces back to her, and she hands the ball to Helen who makes a wobbly attempt. Instead of leaving her alone, Wendy decides to help.
56) 3) dialog: Stand here. Helen obliges, and readies her shot
56) 4) dialog: Don’t bend so much. Aim the fingers of your bottom hand toward the back of the rim. Helen tries it, and makes basket.
56) 5) dialog: That wasn’t bad.
56) 9) dialog: I guess. Maybe you only think you’re new. Maybe you’re the same, only you don’t know it.

56) 13) dialog: I’m not lying to him. Helen is surprised, but tries to hold it back

56) 27) dialog: It’s like custom made pants. They fit you perfectly but you can’t change. Not even a little.

56) 34) dialog: Hello? Inside the bathroom, Sean is getting out of the shower Wendy opens the door and knocks him down. Sean tries to get up and Wendy goes to help him when she sees HER BOX on the floor, the contents clearly rifled through, water dripping over it from the shower. Her first instinct is to save the valuable contents from getting wet so she grabs the stuff.
56) 36) dialog: That’s not what’s in here.
56) 38) dialog: It’s not porn. It’s just--
56) 40) dialog: Screw you. 11/4/05 97. Sean doesn’t say anything, he just sits on the lip of the tub. WENDY (CONT’D) Do you want me to go? Sean shrugs. Wendy reaches out and takes his hand to get him to stand. He pulls it away so she gets down on the floor and takes his wet hand and puts in to her lips. Then she kisses each finger. She kisses his palm, and then his wrist. Sean doesn’t pull away.
56) 41) dialog: Look, I don’t know how this works. I mean, do we fight now? Tell me what we do.
56) 43) dialog: (trying to make a joke) So this is what being dumped feels like, huh?

56) 53) dialog: You’re insane.
56) 55) dialog: I’m not saying it has value. But it’s what? Letters? A couple of trinkets? She holds up the “Hoochie” necklace.
56) 56) dialog: This? Some pictures of me naked? You’re acting like you’re pure and virginal.
56) 58) dialog: Really? What was the name of the blowjob girl?
56) 60) dialog: From the party? Billie told me. The girl who went down on you?
56) 62) dialog: Please. Don’t be average. It isn’t different. Either you agree to be in this with me, or you don’t. 93 11/4/05 99. Sean pulls his hand away.
56) 64) dialog: You could just forget it? If I burned it, you would just forget that I was ever someone else. She isn’t sure what she was, so she just stops.
57) 0) text: School is over, and everyone mills around, grabbing books, screaming at each other. It’s chaos.

57) 6) dialog: (not listening) Yeah, okay. Billie looks lost without Ann or Wendy, but straightens her back and walks to the soda machines, feeds in her dollar. Some buckeyes are thrown at her. She doesn’t flinch. More are thrown. Still, Billie doesn’t move. Finally a barrage of buckeyes are raining down on Billie. She flinches when one hits her in the face. Wendy watches, unable to move.
57) 7) dialog: (it is killing her) Say something. Do something.
57) 9) dialog: Not you. Her. Billie finally turns and leaves, never looking at Wendy, never reacting. As she leaves, the other seniors clap.
57) 12) dialog: I have to see if she’s okay. Sean grabs her wrist.
57) 16) dialog: I’m not going to burn it. I’m not going to say I’m sorry for what happened.
57) 18) dialog: And I’m not going to apologize. You either love me, or you don’t. I just gave up five of the best people in the world for you.
57) 20) dialog: So what? So what if I slept with them? They matter to me. And I just walked away and destroyed my life because you walked up with all this...
57) 22) dialog: You offered me a role in your fairy tale. That’s all. Sean doesn’t know what to say. So Wendy makes a decision for both of them.
57) 23) dialog: You don’t want me to be your girlfriend. INT. BILLIE’S CAR - DAY 94 Billie sees Wendy in the rearview mirror. Billie smiles, she can’t help it. And she reaches over and unlocks the passenger car door. Wendy gets in.

57) 35) dialog: I love you.

58) 0) text: No sound. Billie and Wendy walk toward the school, Wendy is looking ahead of her, Billie is looking at Wendy. At first we see them close up and then we are inside the school, watching them as they walk towards the front glass doors, and when they finally get there, and they open them, we hear the chatter and background of the school again.
59) 0) text: Billie and Wendy stand in front of Ryan, Aaron and Sean. The milling stops. Everyone stares. There’s a long incredibly uncomfortable pause.

59) 22) dialog: Or how Jonah and Robert have been sleeping together for three years. Or how Ann’s mom tied her hands together so she wouldn’t touch herself when she was six.

Or the time we all got crabs because Price fooled around with some girl over Christmas break. Yeah, we’re one big happy family-- Billie has left the lounge. Wendy turns to Sean.
59) 23) dialog: Burn the box yourself. I don’t need it anymore. Wendy walks out of the school. 97 98 99 100 11/4/05 106.
60) 0) text: Wendy smiles as she walks. For the first time, there is no hesitation.
64) 0) text: Wendy sits on the kitchen counter watching Nathan cook She is holding a wooden spoon and Nathan hands her a mixing bowl, so Wendy mixes. She kicks her legs absently against the wooden cabinet and then kicks her shoes off. The camera pulls back, leaving the room, so we see Wendy framed in the doorway, Nathan walks out and it is just Wendy alone and happy, a dopey half smile on her face, as the credits start to roll.
