14) 76) dialog: (to Ann and Wendy) A little help, here? Instead the girls all sit on Price, and it turns into more of a wrestling match/tickling fight. Price is outnumbered so Robert and Jonah come to his “rescue.” Robert grabs Billie and Jonah grabs Wendy, leaving Ann on top of Price.

A small crowd is gathering, though they try to be casual. Ryan isn’t saying anything, she’s trying to focus on Aaron. And she looks like she might cry.
32) 3) dialog: Thank god. One second. Wendy sits on Price’s bed, flipping through the Magazines. She notices that on some pages there is writing. 11/4/05 51. On one page it says “I’m four inches taller” above a picture of a famous actor. On another page it says, “Get those Abs”. Wendy puts the magazine down. The bathroom door opens but Price doesn’t come out.

32) 28) dialog: Yeah. In a minute. Wendy watches him look in the mirror again. INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 54 Robert sleeps with Ann. Price, his hair still black, is with Wendy. Billie is with Jonah. Wendy touches Price’s hair and pulls her hand away. She looks into his eyes, but he won’t look at her. She pushes Price away, and he doesn’t pursue her. After a minute Price stands up and walks to another room where we hear a TV turn on. Wendy stands up and goes outside. EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE: FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 55 Wendy and Billie get comfortable on the steps, this time Billie wrapping her arms around Wendy, who sits a step below her.
40) 54) dialog: (to Wendy) We can stop if you want to.
40) 64) dialog: (trying for a joke) Break out the mud. Or the jello. Nobody laughs. 11/4/05 76.
40) 76) dialog: Hold on.
40) 79) dialog: She’s cheating on us? There’s a beat as Wendy doesn’t say anything. She isn’t denying it and one by one the group gets it -- she is cheating on them. EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE: FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 71 Wendy stumbles out of the house, crying. As the door shuts we see Billie standing, Ann behind her, the guys behind Ann - all watching Wendy go.
63) 0) text: The House Party, with the porn, the drinking, the girls making out with other girls. Ann is giving a guy a pole dance with a blank look on her face. We track through the same party, and the Tank-Top Girl #1 from the first party pulls Price into a bedroom. INT. BILLIE’S HOUSE: ROOM - NIGHT 102 Billie has the box open in front of her but we don’t see her face, as she sits on the floor of her room. Laid out on the floor, encircling her, are various mementos. She lays each one out carefully, in some order we are not privy to. She smooths a few pictures, she carefully places a lighter next to an old license plate. As we circle the items, we catch a passing glimpse of Billie, who might be crying.
