WENDY BERGMAN (senior, 17, beautiful but not ready to accept it) walks through the “Coop” private school grounds; she leads us under banners that say “WELCOME NEW CLASS” and “DON’T DIS THE ORIENTATION -- HAVE FUN AND WELCOME!” It all feels like it could be the Summer of Love except for the girls are wearing Seven jeans and the guys are wearing vintage and everyone’s hair is done, even the ‘alternative’ kids. Wendy passes by as a group of fifty students does a ‘lap sit’ -- they stand in a circle and then sit down at the same time. Eventually they fall amid general hysterical laughter. If Wendy wasn’t rolling her eyes before, she certainly is now. ACROSS THE QUAD we meet BILLIE (17, short blond hair and vintage clothes, hottest girl in school according to current web polls). She is walking towards Wendy; she is blond to Wendy’s brunette, intelligent enthusiasm to Wendy’s brilliant sarcasm. They are a perfect match for each other. A car pulls up quickly between them as they near the parking lot. It squeals to a stop and SEAN MAYER (17, tall with good looks that skew slightly pretty) gets out of the car. The car squeals away. If it looks like the opening of the Breakfast Club, well, all the better. He skulks towards the orientation festivities but he also steals a glance at Wendy. Billie yells out to Wendy:

3) 5) dialog: I’m new. I figured I could, I dunno, memorize where everything was.
3) 8) dialog: Like irony.
3) 11) dialog: You’re not blowing anything up, are you? Wendy turns back to her leaf.
3) 13) dialog: You couldn’t try it during school?
3) 15) dialog: But She puts her finger to her lips.
3) 17) dialog: (smiles) Your secret’s safe. I swear.
3) 19) dialog: My mom’s a chemist. I would never make fun of you for liking this stuff.

9) 15) dialog: You’re funny.
9) 17) dialog: Yeah. Clever. Funny. Smart. You like science.
9) 19) dialog: You are definitely not ugly. You’re just pretty and smart. Wendy has nothing to say to this. They move closer to each other so that they are almost kissing, but they don’t touch.
9) 21) dialog: Okay.

21) 4) dialog: Oh. (embarrassed) Oh, yeah. (he gets his stuff, fumbles) Sorry. Wendy feels terrible but there is nothing she can do, so she lets Sean leave. SEAN (CONT’D) Sorry. Wendy doesn’t say anything. WENDY’s POV: she watches Sean go into school in the rearview mirror, and she sees Robert and Jonah walk by, completely oblivious to the fact that Sean was in her car a few moments ago. Wendy loses sight of Robert and Jonah until there is a loud bang on the roof of her car. Wendy throws the door open.
