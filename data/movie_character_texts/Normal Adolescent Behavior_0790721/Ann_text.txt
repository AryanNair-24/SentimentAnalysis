WENDY BERGMAN (senior, 17, beautiful but not ready to accept it) walks through the “Coop” private school grounds; she leads us under banners that say “WELCOME NEW CLASS” and “DON’T DIS THE ORIENTATION -- HAVE FUN AND WELCOME!” It all feels like it could be the Summer of Love except for the girls are wearing Seven jeans and the guys are wearing vintage and everyone’s hair is done, even the ‘alternative’ kids. Wendy passes by as a group of fifty students does a ‘lap sit’ -- they stand in a circle and then sit down at the same time. Eventually they fall amid general hysterical laughter. If Wendy wasn’t rolling her eyes before, she certainly is now. ACROSS THE QUAD we meet BILLIE (17, short blond hair and vintage clothes, hottest girl in school according to current web polls). She is walking towards Wendy; she is blond to Wendy’s brunette, intelligent enthusiasm to Wendy’s brilliant sarcasm. They are a perfect match for each other. A car pulls up quickly between them as they near the parking lot. It squeals to a stop and SEAN MAYER (17, tall with good looks that skew slightly pretty) gets out of the car. The car squeals away. If it looks like the opening of the Breakfast Club, well, all the better. He skulks towards the orientation festivities but he also steals a glance at Wendy. Billie yells out to Wendy:

14) 40) dialog: I dunno. That Harry Potter kid probably.
14) 49) dialog: I can do whatever I want. It’s my box.
14) 79) dialog: Billie is drama. Nonetheless they re-order, and not without some giggling. Now Robert is with Wendy, Price is with Billie, and Jonah is with Ann. The three couples start making out at various speeds, but each one is fully engaged with whomever they are with. As the camera pulls up and moves over the three couples they each end up on the floor, Robert on top of Wendy, he starts to take off his shirt; Billie straddles Price, his hands go underneath her pants; Ann holds Jonah’s hands down and slowly kisses him, moving down his chest Condoms litter the floor. We hold above them. 30 31 11/4/05 28. EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE: ENTRANCE - NIGHT 30 Billie and Wendy sit on the front steps of Robert’s house.

We track through the same party, and the Tank-Top Girl #1 from the first party pulls Price into a bedroom. INT. BILLIE’S HOUSE: ROOM - NIGHT 102 Billie has the box open in front of her but we don’t see her face, as she sits on the floor of her room. Laid out on the floor, encircling her, are various mementos. She lays each one out carefully, in some order we are not privy to. She smooths a few pictures, she carefully places a lighter next to an old license plate. As we circle the items, we catch a passing glimpse of Billie, who might be crying.
