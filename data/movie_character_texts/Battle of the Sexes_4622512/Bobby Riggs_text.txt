He turns in time to see a pair of underpants float down towards him.

67) 1) dialog: Larry!...Sleeping? No, no, we got a party going on here! To the victor, the spoils, right? He waves the phone around vaguely in an attempt to create some atmosphere...
67) 2) dialog: You spoke to Jerry? You should. He’s the man. Uhuh, uhuh- of course we'll agree, you know me, I’m a gentleman...Well, that’s just great news, Larry. Great news. Send my love to Billie Jean. He puts down the phone, puts up both arms in victory.
67) 3) dialog: Alright! Alright! An echo. He looks around. BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D) Maybe some dessert? Hello? The hello reverberates around the empty hall.
69) 2) dialog: Bobby's back!
69) 4) dialog: Attagirl! Can I come in?
69) 7) dialog: I’m on top again. I’ve never felt better. Fresh as a daisy. Barbecued Margaret Court and now I’m playing Billie Jean, for a hundred thousand dollars. How about that? ABC is showing it- prime time. It’s huge.

Great kid. He and Junior, maybe, could, y’know, hang out some. Be a family. Priscilla stares at him, considering.
69) 12) dialog: Jerry Perenchio’s puffing it up like you wouldn't believe. I'm gonna be on the front cover of Time Magazine- I won the triple at Wimbledon and I never got the cover of Time- and when I’ve beaten Billie Jean, Jerry’s put a million dollars on the table for a match against Chrissy Evert...

70) 5) dialog: Don’t get me wrong, I love women. In the bedroom and in the kitchen. But now they want to be everywhere. Where will it end? Pretty soon us boys won't be able to have an evening of cards, go to the game, go fishing, have a drink after work...because that’s what Women’s Lib really means. Well, it’s got to stop. And Bobby Riggs is the man to stop it. This, ladies and gentlemen, is Custer’s Last Stand- He turns to Billie and mumbles out the corner of his mout

75) 6) dialog: Worried? Look, she’s got no forehand, she’s a slice-and-net kinda player. Like all women, she’s emotionally fragile. She just won't be able to take the pressure.
