Before we know where we are we shall have the full apparatus of totalitarianism. This young boy is a living witness to these diabolical proposals. The people - the common people - must know... must see! There are rare traditions of liberty to defend. The tradition of liberty means all. The common people will let it go!

A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
