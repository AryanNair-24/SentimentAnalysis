71) 5) dialog: You gotta think about why you went there. Seriously. You don’t think I wasn’t fishing for where you were staying when I told you my hotel. These are the urges we gotta stamp out. Whole reason we’re even here. Gotta control this. He taps his head too hard. Admonishing.

Then, when I got older and discovered booze, I’d get real drunk and I’d let my guard down. Basically I’d wrestle guys and fight just to get the contact ina way that seemed okay. But, you know, people started to notice and talk. Guess I’d go too far too often. (beat) Then, one party, I get real drunk, I mean like super crazy drunk and, while a bunch of people are cheering me and watching me wrestle this kid, I kiss this dude, like full on, on the mouth. (beat) I think in my haze I thought it was okay ‘cause I figured it would look like a domination over a kid everyone was already suspect over. Jared listens, deeply curious.
87) 4) dialog: .- But when I saw it wasn’t working, I had to do something and so -- (He sighs deeply) I really started to whale on this kid... like choked him out and beat his face in... like bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

87) 7) dialog: And I’m committed, I’m not here to waste anyone’s time, don’t get me wrong, but - (beat) - I am what I am. I don’t think there is any changing me and my thoughts and whatnot. But I do know by staying off the drink and making certain choices, I can just choke that side of me away. Put it aside. There is a difference. Whether you can actually change or just choose different things. Jared absorbs this. Jon knows he can’t change. He just believes he can put his desires in a drawer.
