5) 0) text: ON A TV SCREEN: a grainy black-and-white tape, date and t stamped at the bottom. A grungy street, palm trees. The l from the monitor dimly illuminates Carver and Stevens. On SCREEN the CAMERA finds: A MAN in jeans, sneakers and  sweatshirt on a street corner.
5) 2) dialog: You can tell he's a cop?
5) 5) dialog: Then why's he taking him to the room?
5) 7) text: Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed. ON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear  their voices. DEALER: "Here, try some of it." UNDERCOVER  COP: "Uhh... No, I don't..." DEALER: "Why not, you  sonofabitch?" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION. A plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAM wobbles after him.
5) 11) text: He slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's face.
5) 13) dialog: Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.

5) 16) text: Carver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something.
5) 20) dialog: You are. If you want to be. (off Stevens) Most undercover guys don't know what  they're doing because it's a day  gig. (indicates dead cop  on TV) I need somebody who goes under and  stays there; six months, a year,  five years...
5) 22) dialog: Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me  information.
5) 24) dialog: He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A  scumbag. But for the right side. (beat) I want you to come to Los Angeles on  loan to the Justice Department as a  federal agent. Your experience there  will be credited toward your seniority  here. And you'll come back to  Cleveland a P3 or higher.

5) 29) dialog: (tolerant) Come on, a little grass...?
5) 31) dialog: What's to understand? You saw your  father killed when you were ten, and  you decided you wouldn't be like  that. (off Stevens' surprise,  Carver grins) I'm God, I know everything. You wanted  to be a good boy, so you became a  cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's  why you got the hard-on for Taft.
5) 33) dialog: (opening Joe's file;  as if reluctantly) I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're  never going to be a Taft.
5) 36) dialog: (looks at MMPI results) You ever take a look at your  psychological profile? You score  almost like a criminal. (reading) "Resents authority..."
5) 38) dialog: "...Exaggerated moral standards, but  with no underlying value system."  Look at the anger, the repressed  violence, it's almost off the scale...
5) 40) text: Carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just  clusters of numbers. Stevens is upset, though oddly  unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.
5) 41) dialog: Why'd you join the force?

(sits back) There's a man named Ramon Gallegos  who supplies 60% of the cocaine to  the West Coast. He's smart, smooth,  and sufficiently elusive that we  don't even have an adult photograph  of him. However, his uncle is Hector  Guzman, an important Latin American  political figure. Gallegos uses  Uncle's connections to get product  into the country, and everyone we've  sent after him has ended up like  that...
5) 46) dialog: You already are, that's the point... (indicates file, test  scores) You've got the ability and the  personality to go underground and  blend in completely. That's what the  others couldn't. Some part of them  showed. That's why they're dead.  See, there's only one rule in this  game.

21) 6) dialog: Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.
21) 8) dialog: Rush it, please. I want art, John,  not reality. Budget hearings start  in April, and I need Gallegos by  then. They won't give us funding for  three ounce buys.

41) 1) dialog: Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go  grow flowers someplace.
62) 1) dialog: (dismissive) Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20  segment...

97) 2) text: Carver peels away fast. He's very angry, frightened, too, but that's hidden.
97) 3) dialog: Where the hell have you been?
97) 5) text: There's an indifference to Carver's authority we haven't  heard before. Hull isn't even aware of it, but Carver is.
97) 6) dialog: You violated a direct order to stay  away from that bust. As a result, a  police informant is dead, a state  senator was critically injured in  the tunnel pile up and a city  policeman was subsequently murdered.
97) 8) dialog: Don't get smart with me, motherfucker.
98) 2) dialog: Never have, never will. (puts the flask away) I want you to give me your gun. You're  coming in right now.
98) 4) dialog: Your assignment has been terminated.  You're not going out there again. If  I have to, I'll put you in custody.
98) 6) text: Carver says nothing. Suddenly Hull understands.
98) 8) text: Carver snorts: ridiculous.
98) 10) dialog: You violated orders, so you're  through. Don't make a conspiracy  theory out of it.

98) 21) dialog: (continuing) I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a  big deal down there.
98) 23) dialog: Guzman, right. Our government supports  Guzman because he's a moderate. That's  a right-winger who's pro-U.S. (he doesn't like it  either) If Gallegos got busted here, it would  hurt Guzman's political career there.  It's politics, John, not drugs.
98) 25) dialog: I'm going to Washington, John. I'll  bring you with me. We'll have clout,  money...
98) 27) dialog: We tried.

128) 4) dialog: That's the drug game. Plus a change...  I want you to come back to work for  me. You'll beat all charges on a  technicality and go back to who you  were.
128) 6) dialog: Does anyone really know?
128) 8) dialog: Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?
128) 10) dialog: (continuing) I'm God, remember?
