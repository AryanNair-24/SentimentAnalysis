35) 20) dialog: I think that’s what my ex always wanted from me. To accept his belly and all of his quirks. But in the end I was totally repulsed by him sexually. He was kind of terrible in bed. Very clumsy.
35) 22) dialog: Oh, just a sec. Marianne runs in the house and returns with her book of poetry. She hands it to Eva. MARIANNE (CONT’D) It’s my last copy, but I want you to have it.

40) 4) dialog: I tried really hard. He’d go on so many diets and cheat all the time and act shocked when he got fatter. It was so irritating. It almost wasn’t the weight that bugged me, it was his behavior about the weight. Just then TWO FEMALE HIKERS (30's), who are going in the opposite direction, give Marianne a double-take.
40) 6) dialog: Yes.

47) 1) dialog: Crazy morning. I got a wonderful call from Joni Mitchell. She read the galleys for my new collection and loved it.
47) 3) dialog: Yeah, we've been for a while. And I met a nice guy, We went out last night. He’s in great shape, he really takes care of himself. He’s vegan. He actually read my work before he knew me. Isn’t that cool?
47) 5) dialog: We‘re going out again tomorrow. I hope it goes well. I tend to get my hopes up too early. With Albert, it always felt like a bait and switch.
47) 8) dialog: Yes! And he cooked! He made me this dish, spaghetti with eggplant and mozzarella.

51) 5) dialog: (pouring wine) He thinks he should take her to school, not me. We already agreed it would be me. Tess wants it to be me. She told me.
51) 8) dialog: I don’t think so. He’s a wreck about her leaving and she doesn’t need that kind of energy. They sit across from one another at the table.
51) 9) dialog: He focuses so much on her and she can feel it.
51) 11) dialog: Maybe if he had a girlfriend, or something like that, it would balance it out. But I can’t see that happening. Nope.
51) 13) dialog: He’s just - a loser, you know? I hate to use that word, but it fits. Eva nods, her heart sinking.
51) 15) dialog: He just never got his life together. Okay, for instance ~ and this is just typical Albert. When I met him he had nothing next to his bed, like a table or something. Nothing. He’d put everything on the floor. And I thought, this is cute, kind of bohemian or whatever. But when we got married I got us night tables, you know, like normal people. Then I was in his house, I don’t know, a year ago. And I saw all his stuff on the floor again. I mean, I took the night tables, granted, but you'd think he’d get some new ones. Metaphorically speaking, he’s not building a life for himself. You know what I mean? The phone rings and she looks at it. 7

51) 19) dialog: I’m sorry you have to hear this. This is so embarrassing.
51) 21) dialog: (sad) You know, these are all little things. Ultimately, I think I just never felt understood by him. He didn’t understand my poetry. He just never got me. (beat) Have you ever felt like someone got you? Eva thinks and breaks into a bittersweet smile, realizing much Albert does get her. MARIANNE (CONT’D) What about the flabby guy?

59) 19) dialog: Thanks. I’m sure you understand them. Eva mouths “No, I don’t” but Marianne doesn’t see. The fr door slams.
59) 21) dialog: Out here honey. Eva freezes, looking down and away. Tess doesn’t notice h at first.
59) 23) dialog: Honey, I want you to meet -
59) 26) dialog: You guys know each other?
59) 30) dialog: You date Albert?
59) 37) dialog: She gives me massages. We're friends. (looking at Eva, hurt) I thought. Albert looks at them and takes it all in.
