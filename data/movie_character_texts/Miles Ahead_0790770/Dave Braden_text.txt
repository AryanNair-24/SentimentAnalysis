71) 0) text: Dave returns with the stuff finding Miles sitting at his station, full concentration, Junior behind him. Dave sidl in next to Junior. They listen, waiting to hear something resembling music. But it's just disorganized noise so far conversations about music, stops and starts, flirtations concepts but nothing concrete. Dave looks at Junior - "Am I missing something?" Junior's look - "Give it a minute." Miles fast forwards the tape but even at it's sped up tem we can tell he's not running over music. He hits stop. Pl Listens. It's more of the same.
71) 1) dialog: When do you come in?
71) 3) dialog: I don't hear any-
71) 7) dialog: Yeah. It's just like... some practice, right? Their "help", neither solicited nor appreciated, has the opposite effect. Miles looks at his horn, nods gravely an lays it down. There's a long uncomfortable silence as Mil starts to walk away. Junior gently puts his hand on his shoulder.
71) 10) dialog: This is not... are you kidding me? Miles clicks on the TV. Focuses on the fight playing ther Dave nods, laughs a long hollow, “How’d I not see this coming,” laugh.
71) 11) dialog: (quietly to himself) What was I thinking?
71) 12) text: (to Miles) Going back in your hole, huh? Guess I should've expected that. It’s a good thing I came prepared. You mind? 97 Dave pulls out his camera. Snaps a shot. Miles squints, finally looks back at him.
71) 13) dialog: I gotta hunker down too. Got work to do. See, I'm coming out with the fuckin' story, you better believe that. Forget about the comeback piece. It’s dirt time. And I’m coming with it. Dave gestures sprinkling dirt on his grave. Miles swigs a Dave rolls on.
71) 14) dialog: Rolling Stone passes, so what? Have any idea how many people'll want to buy what I got? You may be a fucking quitter, but you're still an earner, baby. He pops off a shot and Miles chucks the bottle at his hea Dave ducks it quick, guffaws. He pops another picture.
71) 15) dialog: That's it! But remember, you're Miles Davis! Don’t be repetitive. Switch it up a little bit. I mean, you already did the self-pitying, junkie, jazz burnout, asshole thing, right? Realizing it’s all falling on deaf ears -
71) 16) dialog: 
71) 30) dialog: So, that’s really in there, huh? Miles peeks at Dave a sec, “guess so...” POV from the staircase, someone or something watches the working out. Frances? We hold on the tableau from this vantage point for a beat. Junior nods, plays another chord, Miles blows too, ragged edges ever so slowly smoothing out. Dave walks up to the piano, grabs a pencil from the stand takes a sheet from the pile of staff paper, flips it over starts feverishly writing the story. Stay here until too becomes.
71) 36) dialog: So what should we tell the folks, that Miles Davis has mellowed with age or that folks are just now listening to what he's been saying or -
71) 38) dialog: You like that, huh? The mystery...
71) 40) dialog: Yeah. Dig it. That was a better answer. I was really drawn in. Beautiful playing, Miles.
71) 42) dialog: I'll say. Great. And is there a way that you can put what you just played into words?" Miles shakes his head, chuckles, rises, puts his trumpet stand, picks up the valise stuffed with staff paper, the record SMPWC tucked in behind the tape cannister, and wal off camera.
71) 44) dialog: Hey, are you coming back?! Black.
