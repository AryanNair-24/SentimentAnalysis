13) 4) dialog: Later. Dave really bangs on the door, when finally it opens -
13) 5) dialog: What the - Revealing an exasperated and slightly out of breath 22-ye old skinny white kid, boxer shorts, severe bed-head: A ja plays on the stereo. A bong and weed on the table, the ki wasn't expecting company.
13) 6) dialog: (especially this company -— in fact the last person he’d expect to see) No, uh-uh —
13) 8) dialog: Who the fuck are you to show up at my - you know what “off the record” means, asshole? Justin tries to close the door, Dave holds it.
13) 10) dialog: So what?!
13) 13) dialog: Yeah, I’m... Come in. They already are in but Justin is a little stunned with o of his idols in front of him. Dave closes the door.
14) 0) text: Inside, a naked blonde co-ed, TAMI, is on the bed, coveri herself with a sheet. She's real cute. Look around the room, state of the art, daddy paid for st system - kind of a loungy pad, old leather couch, couple books strewn about, signed posters on the wall; Coltrane, Jimmy Page, James Brown. Justin can’t take his eyes off Miles.
14) 2) dialog: C'mere a second, man - But it’s Justin who moves in close to Dave - authoritativ and star-struck at the same time -
14) 3) dialog: What is going on? Why is he with you, I mean, why are you with him. What do you -
14) 5) dialog: Oooohhhh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah -— Justin moves to and opens a locked drawer, a scale and cocaine inside. 31
14) 6) dialog: So, what can I do you for?
14) 9) dialog: Quarter. Yes, sir. When Justin scoots off to the stash, Miles pats his pocke the .38 nestled inside. “This can go another way too, you know." Dave tries to keep cool, but this is fucked up. Mi sniffs deeply, clears the pipes as Justin weighs out the dope. He ain’t leaving with a flake less than 7 grams. Justin’s oblivious.
14) 10) dialog: You know who the fuck this is, Tami? Tami half shrugs. Justin’s words come out in an excited w
14) 11) dialog: Wow. What a fucking honor. I have a bunch of your -- (points across the room) -- and not just yours -- I mean, the whole, you know... original experience. Blues, gospel... Black music is where it’s at. Justin looks Miles up and down, seemingly really seeing h in his dishevelled state for the first time.
14) 12) dialog: You... want to sit down, Mr. Davis? In Miles eyes, “fuck you and your pity” - but he covers.
14) 14) dialog: Alright. Justin holds out the bag of coke to Miles - 32
14) 15) dialog: That's eight-hundred even. Miles tosses Justin the short clip. Dave goes in:
14) 17) dialog: What are you talking -
14) 19) dialog: (to Dave) Whoa, whoa, whoa? C’mere, man! Justin goes over close to Dave again. Less sycophantic.
14) 20) dialog: First you fuck me and now you’re gonna fuck me? Dave talks loud.
14) 22) dialog: Fuck you - (makes his case to Miles) - this is the price, Mr. Davis.
14) 28) dialog: Listen, I’m not shystering you, Mr. Davis. Look - (counts the cash, peels off a couple bills, puts them on the table) - This is fine. I’1l give you an eighth.
14) 35) dialog: Wait, w-w-waitwaitwait...just hold on. Listen...I - I’m sorry - (in tight to Miles, confession) Look, I’d go ape-shit if you would sign a couple of these for me. You do that, it’1l cover what you're short. Justin finds a pen, holds it out to Miles -
14) 37) dialog: Yeah, for the quarter, what do you think I’m saying, jerk? Miles “reluctantly” takes the pen. Justin grabs the recor hands them to Miles with reverence. As he signs, Miles looks at the iconic record covers for moment. Been a minute since he’s really looked at any of them.
14) 39) dialog: Yeah, but this is the stuff people dig. Miles chuckles gravely, signs two but stops on "Someday MPWC". Considers Frances on the cover. Dave can tell, thi woman really means something. Miles signs one more, holds out his hand. Justin gives hi his quarter of coke. Miles does a quick bump to test it, at Justin -
14) 40) dialog: Right? - and pockets the coke. Justin holds out the empty money to Miles.
14) 42) dialog: Uh... And exits out the door.
