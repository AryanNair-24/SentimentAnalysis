29) 0) text: Miles and Dave enter, decked out like we first saw them a the top of the movie, drawing stares from the few setting for the show later, BARTENDER, MANAGER, BUSBOYS, etc...
29) 5) dialog: (butting in) Hey, Miles, I heard you put it down on that new session y’all did. Miles flashes him a quick look. 58 BARTENDER (CONT’D) My cousin play with your man Larry Coryell sometime. The guy gives Miles a knowing, insiders wink. Miles half acknowledges it, drawn by the sounds of a quintet warming fucking around, running phrases, chord changes, on the Mi composition, "All Blues" (bootleg version) - the trumpet player is where Miles' ear goes - clear, bright sounds... something... The bandstand just out of sight... Comes round the bend and sees Junior on the bandstand - M is stopped in his tracks, the quintet is great, but he's truly captivated by the virtuosity of Junior. Dave is blo away by the kid, goes to comment to Miles, stops, seeing differently now, ‘Miles appreciating greatness’, somethin new. The band is having a good time, laughing as one or anothe calls out rapid chord changes - trying to one up each oth as the players have to catch on/up to the changes - but n Junior - he's right there, a monster, not only keeps up, anchors the band, bringing the music back around on the s like Kelly Slater killing it on the wave of a Tsunami - .
