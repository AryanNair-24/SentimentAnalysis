5) 0) text: Miles sits back against the rail - what these muthufuckas just made him do. His hip now. Dull persistent ache. Can' escape himself - his music: the be-bop, uptempo "Tempus Fugit" mocks him from the speakers as a collage of Columb covers/artists silently study him. Chief among them is Frances, again - on the cover of "Someday My Prince Will Come". He wants to look at her, but doesn't, won't...but she's looking at him.

NYC THEATRE/GRAND THEATRE — DAY Miles steps into the shadows of the wings, smoking a cigarette, digging the PORGY AND BESS rehearsal; for him all about the lead dancer: Frances. Standing by Miles is his close friend and arranger, GIL EVANS, 40s - white, rail thin, a natty argyle style, contrasting Miles' finely tailored Italian suit. Frances is playing Bess - lusty, steamy in her moves. She inspires Miles, she seems to be looking right at him, dan just for him - it's all over his face, he's falling in lo His inspired eyes drift to the TRIO; he ZOOMS IN ON the p keys, the ways the musician moves, collecting, co-opting and then back to FRANCES, the key to it all -- dancing a pas-de-deux with the chiseled, handsome LEAD DANCER; Mile clouds over. Fran stops the music with a wave of her hand.

15) 0) text: Miles and Frances enter frame arm in arm in the cavernous main room of the dilapidated church. Dusty pews and scary judgemental angels, sun shines through the stained glass windows. Flamenco Sketches plays. Frances scans the room then slowly strides away from Mile down the center aisle, hands lightly touching the pews. A she passes, pirouetting, the ROOM CHANGES, darkness becom light (This effect will be achieved with a series of PHOT from a "locked off" camera position as the room is dresse ala City of God). The final PHOTO; Frances reaches the end of the room and turns back to face Miles. The scene comes to life, the sp transformed, an elegant stairway as its centerpiece, lead straight up to heaven. They both bound up the stairs into the bedroom.

As Miles watches, HER VOICE FADES out - we see he's in lo with her not only entirely, but it's every piece of Franc that he adores; hands, her legs, hair, eyes, etc. Miles focuses on each part, breaking her down, Picasso- esque...deconstructing Chopin -- WE NOW HEAR disparate notes, a chord, then another in the progression; half a tone up, birthing a composition based the nine note scale that bookends the composition, Gone, the sound-track to Frances’ dance. Fran spins, laughs, PU IN. Miles eyes narrow as he focuses on what's forming in mind. Fran spins, closes her eyes, given over to the rapture sh feels. When she opens them, Miles is gone. Fran smiles to herself, slightly high, knowing where he’s headed and tha she’s the elixir he drinks to create. She heads out the d seeing Miles at the bottom of the stairs - calls -
