It’s hard to tell. Not well lit except for ring. In the seats we only ever see small groupings. Folks flow in and out of the aisle, getting beers, but mo hurrying back to see the fight; A BLACK AND WHITE MAN in ring, middle weights, scrappy, not scared to mix it up. R 3, you can see it on the card the girl carries as she cli out of the ring, Ding- Ding... Miles looks left, right. POV back from wide; nobody. Mile looks to the left.
