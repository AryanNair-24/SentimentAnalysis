Malcolm gives Keith a look: "Damn". Kei gives Malcolm a look back: "I told you so." Bit by bit, Sebastian eases into the groove. This isn't so bad... Then -- Keith moves to a LAPTOP. Introduces a DRUM-MACHIN SAMPLE. Sebastian, into the music, is caught off-guard. Uneasy no This isn't him... Keith plays a riff on his guitar. Tom echoes it on bass, Malcolm on trumpet. Now it's Sebastian's turn. He hesitat And then -- finally -- he plays the riff... It doesn't feel so bad. The guys build on the riff. Sebas keeps up with them, trying to let go of his presuppositio After all -- these guys can play... The music builds, the whole thing swelling and finally

It's just Keith Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune. And then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and - BOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic tra Mia is taken aback. But she keeps bobbing her head -- as crowd around her GOES CRAZY... Keith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth sounds. We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been transformed beyond recognition. Not a hint of jazz...

He's not fighting any of this. He sees her. She smiles. But something is changing in her expression... She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebast and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfit She looks at the crowd around her -- their hollers growin more and more frenzied as Sebastian launches into a prolo SOLO...
