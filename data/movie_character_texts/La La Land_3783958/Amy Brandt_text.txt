110) 0) text: Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that w outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all.. This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. A painted- backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when parking on the lot... The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the mos covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Moni Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio- backdrop imagination. We've entered a fully fantastical realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's 50's... A148     Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the stree and the cops and the guards... AMY BRANDT races up to Mia seems to beckon her to audition... We see the audition silhouetted against a wall... We don't hear Mia sing, but music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to... B148     PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia u for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old- Hollywood-movie way... Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The SacrГ©-C and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in br colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretch before us... And then a sign -- "CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE".. C148     We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-li Sebastian plays, on cloud nine... C148pt   We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights a decked in movie-movie glow. We're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell -- D148     -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians fro around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter li all the stars of the galaxy... ...they DANCE. Revision                        84.
