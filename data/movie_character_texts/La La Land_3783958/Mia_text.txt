We've entered a fully fantastical realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's 50's... A148     Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the stree and the cops and the guards... AMY BRANDT races up to Mia seems to beckon her to audition... We see the audition silhouetted against a wall... We don't hear Mia sing, but music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to... B148     PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia u for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old- Hollywood-movie way... Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The SacrГ©-C and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in br colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretch before us... And then a sign -- "CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE".. C148     We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-li Sebastian plays, on cloud nine... C148pt   We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights a decked in movie-movie glow. We're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell -- D148     -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians fro around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter li all the stars of the galaxy... ...they DANCE. Revision                        84.
110) 1) text: This is the last time we'll ever see them dance, and they seem to recognize that, so graceful and poised are their movements... Remember -- this is a romance more perfect t a real romance could ever be... We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam... 16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and poc of light... Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES we move in closer on the imagery: 149   The first home... (16mm) 150   Mia's pregnancy... (16mm) 151   The newborn child... (16mm) 152   The child's first birthday... (16mm) 153   The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies. These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- a yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... The SCORE continuing to sway and taking us right up to... 154   Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mot hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look here is unaffected, just everyday. The MUSIC quiets sligh everything goes more natural, as this happily married cou hit the road... 155   ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam... a side route, winding up in another part of L.A... 156   ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a playing somewhere... 157   ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebas club... They sit down to listen... And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody... ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as and Sebastian look into each other's eyes, lean in and, softly, but with all the love in the world... ...KISS. Revision                           85.

110) 4) dialog: No... We should go. He nods. They rise from their seats and head for the exit Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia and looks back at Sebastian. He looks at her. Their eyes A hint of a tear in both... And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smil It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- b it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized th melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and st thinks of it to this day... Then she walks out the door. Sebastian glances at his fel musicians. Then, he nods, and they launch into a new char
111) 0) text: It's silent outside. You can't hear the music. Mia and Da reach their car. They get in. It pulls out. Passing by Sebastian's club, the car continues on. We sta the jazz club on one side of the frame, the lights of the on the other. Those lights growing smaller and smaller, b finally disappearing into the big L.A. night... IRIS FADE OUT.
