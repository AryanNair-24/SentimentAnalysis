60) 2) dialog: Like it?
60) 4) dialog: Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo included... Reactive armor, twin M240 machine guns, 120mm smoothbore cannon. Guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line.
60) 7) dialog: How about a Marine Corps assault hovercraft?
60) 10) dialog: Stack 'em in the office, if you have to. Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.
60) 11) dialog: ... You weren't downtown tonight by any chance, were you, Tony?
60) 13) dialog: Me either.
60) 15) dialog: White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips. Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No. Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup. Studies them a moment. Shrugs.
60) 16) dialog: You got me.
60) 18) dialog: There a timetable on this, or --
60) 20) dialog: That's what I figured.
68) 0) text: Archie's had the shit beat out of him.
68) 1) dialog: It's Archie.    Bad news.   We got a problem.
68) 3) dialog: ... I did what you said, right? Put it out on the street, trying to get info on the stones. Next thing I know, the Jackson Five here show up... Now, there are three significant elements to notice here. One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're heavily armed. Three, they're gonna beat me like a bongo drum...
69) 0) text: Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor. On screen, Archie surrenders immediately.
69) 1) dialog: ... I mean, hey, I coulda resisted, sure -- and they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever -- but then, see, I'm thinking: How would I be able to tell Tony what happened to the stones? Right? What good am I dead or on life-support. So I threw in the towel. Reluctantly, of course. For your sake. FAIT
69) 3) dialog: What?
69) 6) dialog: Uh... Don't know.
69) 8) dialog: Well... 'Give us the stones, motherfucker.' You know. That kinda thing.
69) 10) dialog: Pretty much.    Yeah.
69) 13) dialog: Look around. Are you crazy? Then again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause I have no idea who you are.
69) 15) dialog: (re: footage) I don't know that, but I know they got great guns. I can't even get those. U.S. Special Forces only.
69) 17) dialog: What?
69) 24) dialog: Let me see that. Archie takes it, reads.
69) 25) dialog: Taiwan. Central Security Bureau. Taiwanese intelligence.
70) 16) dialog: Oh, Jesus...
70) 26) dialog: Oh, Jesus...
78) 13) text: It's no guess... But I could be wrong... We'll hit the club. You gotta see Archie.
87) 0) text: Su and Archie.
87) 2) dialog: Not exactly boxing. More dangerous. No gloves. No rules. Big money. Very illegal... Started holding 'em during the daytime to fool the cops.
87) 4) dialog: I don't. But Chambers owns the operation, so I figure it's a good place to start. (then)
89) 3) dialog: I didn't see his face.   But I'll know his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten carats. Round cut with   square mount. Good color and clarity.   I remember thinking what it would  do to my face if he hit me. OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat help disguise himself...
90) 0) text: Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a gate to the fight arena beyond.
90) 2) dialog: Leave that to me. Then, to the Guard --
90) 3) dialog: Hey, man, how you doing? Got a fighter here I want to enter. Su shoots him a surprised look.
90) 4) dialog: My man's gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there and get all Chinese on 'em -- the teeth are gonna fly, the blood's gonna run... Gonna be fun.
90) 7) dialog: You won't have to. That was just to get us in.
90) 9) dialog: Good day, over a million dollars'll pass hands in here.
90) 11) dialog: Yeah.    Okay. He looks around.      Lotta African-American males.
90) 12) dialog: Could take a little while. As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at han and Su follows...
111) 0) text: Archie still looking for the man with the diamond pinkie-ring. Su still following.
111) 1) dialog: ... By the way, when we do find him, what then?
111) 5) dialog: You're after the stones, too, huh? No response from Su.   Beat.
111) 6) dialog: ... I did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about 'em... Guess who get back to me? My Defense Department connection. Now, I think he's calling me about this surplus F- 14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands on. But no. Turns out he's calling to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan about black stones -- In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as t midget calls out --
111) 8) dialog: (to Su)
111) 11) dialog: They're -- Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --
111) 17) dialog: I know it    wasn't the plan. But if you don't    fight, they're gonna toss us out on    our asses. We might never find the    guy. A long beat.    Su hates this place.   Su hates Archie.
116) 2) dialog: still checking out the hands of African-American men in the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.
116) 4) dialog: Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring.
127) 0) text: It's down to Su and the kick boxer.    The kick boxer spi and kicks and punches, and... Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.    Ties him i pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then... Looks for Archie.     Can't find him. Can't find the guy wearing the ring.     And hurries out of the cage.
130) 0) text: Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird. Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.
130) 2) dialog: Decided to leave early.
130) 4) dialog: Right here. Su looks inside the car.
130) 6) dialog: Good thing I brought my stunner. He ZAPS the air.    Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.
130) 7) dialog: Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?
137) 0) text: Rock bottom. Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off.      D tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help. Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent. Even Archie's quiet for once. The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chine to someone who is obviously his superior.
140) 34) dialog: Doomsday in disguise. All eyes go to him.
140) 35) dialog: They're some kinda new synthetic plutonium. Small and portable, but mega-powerful.
140) 38) dialog: Yeah, he'd need a big operation for that. Why bother? Just demonstrate the stones work and sell 'em to whichever international scumbag offers the highest bid. He makes millions, they make the bombs, then... 'look out, world.'
140) 45) dialog: Hey, yeah. Flight plans show destinations. All aircraft file 'em with the Aviation Administration. If we could get a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale's going down.
140) 47) dialog: I can help with that.
156) 0) text: In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank ma its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.
156) 6) dialog: Shoot back!
156) 8) dialog: Twin .50's some major firepower. How'd that little shit get one?
164) 0) text: Archie aims the cannon.
164) 2) dialog: No problem.   Absolutely... Load. Tommy slides a shell into the breech.
165) 0) text: Archie and Tommy exult.
165) 2) dialog: I did it.   I can't believe it.
165) 4) dialog: What do I know?
167) 16) dialog: That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a helluva team, y'know? (to Su)
167) 22) dialog: Get real?    What's that mean?
167) 28) dialog: What, you're all gonna go straight, just like that?
167) 30) dialog: Me? Are you kidding? I've had straight jobs. You ever had a
167) 33) dialog: Name one.
167) 35) dialog: ... You were an Avon lady?
167) 37) dialog: No, it's just, well, uh...
