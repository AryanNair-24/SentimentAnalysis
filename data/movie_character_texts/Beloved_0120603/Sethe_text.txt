30) 0) text: The sun shines on a warm April day..a day abundant with growth and renewed hope. But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124. It looks mo worn than before...neglected, abused. A broken window...the front door off it's hinge...a front step splintered and dangerous. INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING. Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the hous revealing the same neglect inside; Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder... Camera enters; INT. KITCHEN - MORNING. Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the w She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - wh seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...In her la lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewin when she fell asleep from fatigue. A LOUD CRASH wakes her up. Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED YELL. Her face registers fear. She realizes where she is, what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast... She places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cl and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper, placing them in the sink... She opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except a SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 1/4 full. searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening  cabinets, doors - places that never stored food. She real there is none left. INT. DENVER'S ROOM - MORNING. Denver finished dressing. She has been able to maintain a semblance of order about her person and room.. But as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we se the same disarray as downstairs... She passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers; BELOVED, sprawled across the bed, half naked. Her belly i huge, her body unwashed. She looks, and behaves, like a w animal... A broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg a she shifted in bed. Her feet, overhanging the bed, are st touching the bedside table where the lamp sat. She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sug old quilt.
30) 5) dialog: Morning.
30) 7) dialog: You hungry? Knowing there must be nothing left, Denver answers;
30) 11) dialog: Baby, don't be like that.
30) 13) dialog: Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
30) 16) dialog: Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
30) 18) dialog: Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
30) 20) dialog: That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
30) 26) dialog: Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
30) 28) dialog: Go upstairs I said!! Sethe's harsh tone is only for Denver. Denver exits the kitchen, afraid to leave them alone... As she moves from the kitchen, she hears;
30) 30) dialog: We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
30) 32) dialog: No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies.. Denver walks up the white stairs... INT. BABY SUGGS' ROOM - DAY. Denver has straightened up her grandmother's room. Cleane away the broken pieces of the lamp. Gathered the remnants the quilt.. She holds the quilt as she sits on the bed, facing the headboard. SHE REMEMBERS:
31) 16) dialog: NO!...She wanted me to do it. Sethe continues her work, without even looking at Denver. Denver pauses a moment, realizing she is of no use here - knowing she needs to help her mother somehow. She looks up to the kitchen, where every cupboard door is open revealing empty shelves...SHE EXITS - HEADING FOR TH FRONT DOOR. INT. FRONT HALL - DAY. C.U. - FRONT DOOR. Denver's hands slowly reaches towards the door lock - and OPENS IT. EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. Denver opens the door, then pushes the broken screen door it's hinge. She closes the door behind her. She begins her walk from the porch to the road. The first time she's ever gone alone..not knowing what she will fac beyond the perimeters of her home. She reaches Bluestone Road and stops. She looks in either direction and sees not a soul. She takes a breath. She begins to walk - to get help. A block from the house, TWO BLACK MEN turn a corner and w towards her. Denver stops, frightened, not knowing what to do. The TWO BLACK MEN pass her, tipping their hats, saying;

32) 2) dialog: Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
32) 4) dialog: She likes this dress...
32) 51) text: Now you all know how I felt about the whole thing. I know the rage Sethe felt in that shed that day.  We all do. But what I could not understand, and still don't, was her reaction to it. Prideful. Too damn complicated for a black woman in her position before God. But whatever she done, I don't like the idea of past errors taking possession of the present. I don't cotton to sin moving in on a house, unleashed and sassy. Every day life takes enough, takes all a woman has. "Sufficient unto the day is evil thereof" and nobody needs more. Nobody needs a grown up evil sitting at a table with a grudge. As long as that ghost showed itself from a ghostly place, I respected it. But once it take on flesh and come into this world, well, the shoe's on the other foot now. I don't mind a little communication between worlds. But this here's an invasion. The women agree.
32) 55) text: Mama, I got a job. Working over at the Bodwins at night. Mr. Bodwin coming over now to pick me up on his way back from town. I'll be staying there nights and coming back here for the daytime. We'll have some money, mama..Mama? Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver approaches her from behind and whispers softly;
34) 0) text: The women continue singing as: Sethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's exit the house. The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused the lack of fear between the women. Sethe is holding Beloved's hand. Beloved is smiling brigh at the beautiful singing. Denver looks to her mother; Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The so of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She l to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has miss although up until this moment was not conscious of missin Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees:

34) 4) dialog: No...no...no..
34) 6) dialog: No...NO..NO..NOOOOOOOOOOOO! As Mr. Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him f 124. HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS;

35) 45) dialog: (cries)
35) 48) dialog: She was my best thing. Paul leans down and takes her hand, entwining his fingers into hers...
35) 50) dialog: Me?...Me? EXT. THE CLEARING - A DAY OUT OF TIME. A beautiful, sunny day. The clearing is full. Everyone lo bright and hopeful. Dressed in bright, summer clothes... A robust Baby Suggs is on her rock giving her best Call, camera pans the crowd of faces eager to believe ....
