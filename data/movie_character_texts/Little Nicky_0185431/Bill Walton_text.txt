39) 1) dialog: What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans. A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINT GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle makes the travelling signal.
