48) 39) dialog: Well, thank God for that! I thought you were dead this time, I really did, then I got your call -- (to Diana)
48) 40) text: He was gone for weeks! Not a word. Very unlike him. Etta extends a hand to Diana.    Diana just looks at it.
48) 41) dialog: Hello. I'm Etta Candy.     Captain Trevor's secretary.
48) 43) dialog: Well, it means I do everything. I go wherever he goes. Do whatever he tells me to do.
48) 46) dialog: (to Steve; re: Diana)
48) 49) dialog: We've got our work cut out for us. We FOLLOW Diana in -- 52   INT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO. - CONTINUOUS ACTION Diana examines a CORSET tight on a MANNEQUIN, Etta and Steve with her.
48) 54) dialog: Of a sort. It's fashion.     Keeps our tummies in.
48) 56) dialog: Only a woman with no tummy would ask that question. Etta holds up an OUTFIT for Diana.
48) 57) dialog: Conservative, but not entirely... un-fun. Diana looks at Steve as if to say, "Do I have to?"
48) 59) dialog: Oh, my! Aren't you terribly cold out here where everyone can see... everything? Let's get you into a nice, warm, private dressing room, shall we? Etta leads Diana off, looking to Steve as if to say, "Where did you find this woman?" 53   INT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO. - WOMAN'S WEAR - MOMENTS LA Diana, in OUTFIT #1 -- frilly and silly -- stands in front of the mirror, miserable. It's ridiculous. Diana pulls the dress up, wondering aloud --
48) 61) dialog: We fight with our principles. It's how we got the vote. She winks at Diana, who relates to principled fighting.
48) 65) dialog: Not that I'm opposed to engaging in a bit of fisticuffs when the situation calls for it, mind you! 53A   INT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO. - WOMAN'S WEAR - MOMENTS L Diana in OUTFIT #2 -- a tight skirt and top.   Etta admires it.
48) 66) dialog: There we are.    Very nice. Diana tries to kick, impossible in this dress. It rips. She shakes her head at Etta. This dress won't do. 54    INT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO. - WOMAN'S WEAR - MOMENTS L Diana, in OUTFIT #3 -- almost exactly what Etta wears - yanks at its high collar impatiently.
48) 68) dialog: (exasperated)
48) 69) text: I can't say that I blame it. 55    INT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO. - MOMENTS LATER Steve walks up to Etta.   He's now dressed in his SUIT.
48) 71) dialog: Trying on outfit number two hundred and twenty-six. Diana emerges from the dressing room in FASHIONABLE WOMAN'S DRESS that, on any other woman, would be unremarkable. On Diana, it's spectacular.
48) 77) text: Etta, the whole point was to make her less conspicuous. Steve looks around the store, grabs a pair of GLASSES. He gently puts the glasses on Diana's face. Looks satisfied.
48) 78) dialog: Really, Steve? All it takes is a pair of specs, and suddenly she's not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen? Diana LOOKS into the mirror, takes a deep breath and settles into the dress. She smiles as she fixes her glasses. 56   EXT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO./OXFORD ST. - CONTINUOUS ACT Diana, HAIR UP, in her GLASSES and NEW OUTFIT pushes through the door as DIANA PRINCE. The MAN IN THE SUIT from earlier, holds it open for her.
48) 80) dialog: Right then, I'll take the rest of this. Good luck, I'll take these back to the office and meet you both later. Etta goes for Diana's SWORD, but Diana yanks it back.
48) 81) dialog: It really doesn't go with the outfit.
48) 83) text: I don't think we're going to run into Ares at the meeting. Diana reluctantly lets Etta take the sword along with the SHOPPING BAGS, presumably carrying her armor.
48) 89) dialog: (raising an eyebrow)
50) 12) dialog: I thought you looked suspicious. SM #1 is stopped in his tracks by Etta, wielding the GODKILLER, shopping bags at her feet.
50) 16) dialog: Where do you think you're going? SM #1 runs in the other direction, but Diana retrieves the LASSO from inside her coat and uses it to pull him off his feet, onto his back. As the lasso glows, Diana kneels at his side, compassionately placing her hand on his chest.    In her mind, his actions are not his fault.
58) 44) dialog: There they are. Etta arrives, flustered, a forced smile on her face.
58) 45) dialog: Hello, all! Sorry, I'm late.   I got waylaid by --
58) 47) dialog: That's what I was going to mention. Steve, Sameer, and Charlie STAND out of respect. Steve glares at Etta. She shrugs apologetically, raises a hand: Just listen, you'll see.
58) 59) dialog: (nearly wetting her pants)
78) 0) text: ETTA is on the other end of the call.
78) 1) dialog: Found it. Steve sees Diana standing on the stairs. He picks up an extension and offers it. Diana listens in (it's her first time using a phone):
78) 3) dialog: Not yet, but we've located him. And lucky you, he's only a few miles away -- at German High Command. At first thought, Steve thinks:   That doesn't sound lucky.
78) 5) dialog: Intel reports Ludendorff is hosting a gala -- a last hurrah before the Germans sign the Armistice. The Kaiser himself will be there. As will Dr. Maru.
149) 0) text: Wonderful chaos in Trafalgar Square! CONFETTI, STREAMERS, FLAGS, people embracing with JOY. HORNS and BRASS BANDS. CHEERING SOLDIERS with CROWNS OF FLOWERS in their hair GRAB pretty NURSES for a kiss. DRUMS THUNDER BY. Diana and Etta walk towards the massive, wondrous celebration. Diana is dressed as Diana Prince, hair up, glasses on. Etta is dressed up, like everybody else partying in the streets. They take in the joy.
149) 1) dialog: You saved everyone.
149) 6) text: Steve did that. Charlie, Sameer, and The Chief, cleaned and scrubbed and wearing suits, join Diana and Etta.
149) 8) text: Did Etta tell you? That General whats-his-name, you know --
149) 9) dialog: Haig.
149) 11) dialog: There's a revolution going on. Even Chief's coming. You should, too.
149) 13) text: I don't think so. Etta stops in front of a recently erected wall of WAR MEMORIAL PHOTOGRAPHS. Steve looks dashing, happy, and very much alive. Diana's already fighting tears.
