31) 0) text: Steve uses the Fokker's 12-BARREL ROTARY CANNON to FIRE on Ludendorff's vehicle -- but it gets away. Steve trains the gun on the evacuated military installation's glass roof, whose WORKERS have just evacuated. He STRAFES it, taking out all of the glass panes before dropping HAND-BOMBS into the complex. The factory EXPLODES in a fire ball as he flies off into the sky! END FLASHBACK.
44) 0) text: GENERAL LUDENDORFF marches toward a HANGAR that's become Dr. Maru's new FACTORY. He's followed by a CAPTAIN and his GUARDS. Ludendorff does not look happy, despite the hustle and bustle of workers.
44) 1) dialog: How long until we are operational?
44) 3) dialog: You have until tonight, Captain.
44) 5) dialog: Do you think I've had food or rest, Captain? Do you hear me making excuses? Your men are weak. Complacent. You've spoiled them. You've let them forget that an attack can come at any time -- from any quarter -- so let's you and I remind them, shall we? Ludendorff SHOOTS the Captain, making an example of him. His body THUDS to the ground.
45) 0) text: Ludendorff walks into Maru's new lab in mid-construction. BARRELS of CHEMICALS and EQUIPMENT line the hangar.
46) 0) text: Maru furiously works, looking at the chemicals, her formulas, writing in a NEW NOTEBOOK -- she's at a crossroads. She stops, stuck -- when Ludendorff approaches.
46) 1) dialog: Doctor.   Are you making progress?
46) 8) dialog: Once the Kaiser sees your newest weapon, he will never sign the armistice.
46) 10) dialog: We will get your book. But I believe in you, not it. I KNOW that you CAN and you WILL succeed. (beat)
46) 11) text: It is what you were put on this Earth to do. The way he says it, as if he were God himself. MARU                       LUDENDORFF
46) 15) text: To restore your strength. General Ludendorff takes the capsule, examines it.
46) 21) dialog: And our war will swallow this world... Forever. PRE-LAP -- The HORN and BELLS of a STEAMSHIP.
53) 0) text: TIGHT ON: a GAS CANISTER.   Maru turns a valve on it, adjusting the pressure. She screws the canister onto the side of a small GLASS CHAMBER containing a GAS MASK. She locks the canister in place, then releases the gas into the chamber. Ludendorff and Maru watch as the NEW GAS hisses in, creeping towards the gas mask, enveloping it. The mask begins to disintegrate -- thin cracks in the glass, wear on the straps, corrosion on the metal. It's just as it was before. Maru, filled with anticipation, wonders: Will it work this time? It does. The gas continues, eating away at the mask -- the glass cracks apart, the straps sever, the metal breaks. A sign of the pain and horror it will soon inflict. It is Maru's greatest achievement -- then even the glass chamber itself starts to shudder -- and crack!
53) 4) dialog: Congratulations, Doctor. OFF the steaming, rotting gas mask...
54) 0) text: Steve, Darnell,   Sir Patrick, GENERAL DOUGLAS HAIG, and the BRITISH WAR   CABINET crowd in a room, walls full of MAPS and PHOTOS   of LUDENDORFF and DR. MARU (before her metal implants)   and the notebook. A TERRAIN MAP in the center. Diana stands near the door watching, LISTENING.   She walks to the wall of PHOTOGRAPHS.

65) 11) dialog: (to the council)
65) 13) text: If only you had faith in me. The way Ludendorff says it, he almost expects everyone to simply agree with him, but Von Hindenburg gets to his feet, angry --
65) 15) dialog: One attack and the war is ours. As we speak, my chemist and her team are --
65) 17) text: Twenty-four hours from now this war will end. It is over. Ludendorff looks around, nods.
65) 18) dialog: For all of you. Ludendorff turns and exits --
66) 0) text: Ludendorff nods to Dr. Maru who throws a CANISTER OF GAS in. Maru watches curiously as Ludendorff then tosses a GAS MASK in. Von Hindenberg and the men look at the mask. Ludendorff closes the doors as the canister erupts. A COMMOTION within the room breaks out as the gas spreads. Unable to escape, the men desperately fight over the gas mask.
66) 2) dialog: Yes, but they don't know that.
66) 6) dialog: It's time to stage our demonstration for the Kaiser.
83) 22) text: There's no way to get you in. Let me scout it and report back. Worse case, we follow Ludendorff when he leaves and you can use that magic lasso of yours to get him to tell us where it is.
86) 0) text: Steve walks up the stairs, spotting the KAISER at the head of the RECEIVING LINE atop them. Ludendorff is next to him, talking intensely to Dr. Maru. As much as they try not to, people can't help but stare at Maru.
86) 2) dialog: Soon it won't matter.
86) 7) dialog: We continue as planned. Now go. I have people to tend to beyond you. Maru is taken aback by his firmness. Feels eyes staring at her. She's used to rejection, but not from him. She nods and breaks   off, moving into the GRAND BALLROOM An ORCHESTRA plays,   COUPLES waltz, CHANDELIERS blaze. The room is full of   OFFICERS, their WIVES and prominent CIVILIANS in formal   wear. Maru moves to a FIREPLACE, staring at the fire.
86) 29) dialog: Enjoying the party?
86) 32) dialog: A German victory, of course. He offers her hand to dance.       She takes it, sizing h up.
86) 34) dialog: `Peace is only an armistice in an endless war.' Diana understands, tenses.
86) 36) dialog: (happily surprised)
86) 38) dialog: And in exchange, war gives man purpose. A chance to rise above his petty, mortal little life and be better than he is.
86) 44) dialog: You know nothing about the gods --
86) 46) dialog: My apologies. You'll excuse me. (beat)
86) 47) text: Enjoy the fireworks. Just as he turns his back on Diana, she reaches for her SWORD. She's about to draw it when -- Steve gets between them, facing her! He pulls Diana away from Ludendorff, taking her hand -- dancing with her as cover.

She charges the tower, flipping off her horse and over a BARBED WIRE FENCE -- she takes out more Germans -- slashes through a SECOND BARBED WIRE FENCE -- fights to the tower and -- Diana lassos a soldier on the balcony, yanking him down then leaping up to the tower herself!
94) 0) text: Ludendorff turns as Diana arrives, wielding the GODKILLER. He smirks, scoffing --
94) 1) dialog: Nice to see you again. This is a surprise.
94) 6) dialog: But I have things to do. -- Ludendorff FIRES at Diana! She blocks the bullet with her bracelet, ricocheting it back at Ludendorff's gun! It explodes in his hand! He cries out in pain, shocked! Diana lowers her smoking bracelet, looking him in the eyes -- assuming he knows who she is now after that display of power.
95) 0) text: Diana sees Ludendorff's veins bulging, almost supernatural -- her eyes widen with confirmation. Diana moves quickly, thrusting the Godkiller at him. He dodges it. She strikes him in the face with her fist. They trade blows. He grabs a BAYONETTED RIFLE mounted on the wall. Ludendorff uses the rifle as A GUN, A SPEAR, and A SWORD. He HITS Diana again and again -- but Diana strikes back with such FORCE that he flies backwards through the WINDOW and onto the narrow walkway outside. Ludendorff struggles to his feet --
96) 0) text: Diana CHARGES AGAIN. Ludendorff manages to escape being gored by CLIMBING UP TO THE TOWER ROOF. Ludendorff stands, holding his bayonet, as Diana LEAPS up on the roof to join him -- and the BATTLE RAGES on, SWORD AGAINST BAYONET, both so close to plummeting to the ground with every volley. But then Ludendorff lands a BLOW that sends Diana and his bayonet sliding over the roof's edge. She manages to grip the ledge but loses the Godkiller.

98) 0) text: Diana takes in a breath, SMELLS the CHEMICALS in the air, HEARS the sounds across the AIRFIELD -- she has become hyper aware of the harshness of the world around her. Diana turns, seeing a FIGURE THROUGH the windows looking at Ludendorff's plans. For a brief moment, she thinks it's Steve.
98) 14) text: ... all of this -- I did none of it. Alarmed, Diana reaches for her sword -- but her hand grasps at nothing -- she quickly realizes it's still in Ludendorff! Diana leaps OUT OF FRAME to retrieve it!
