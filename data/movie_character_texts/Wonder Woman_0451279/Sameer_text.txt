The photograph sees our team imbuing a sense of pride and accomplishment. Steve's face is turned towards Diana's, with a look of something more than admiration. Moments later, Diana walks with Sameer. They look back at Charlie, head hung low, shaken. Charlie fumbles with his flask, dropping it.
76) 2) dialog: Not everyone gets to be who they want to be all the time. Me, I wanted to be an actor, not a soldier. But I'm the wrong color.

Steve waves them off.

81) 4) dialog: The villagers gave them to us.
81) 6) dialog: They called us heroes.
81) 11) dialog: Yeah, we know Diana's capable of looking after herself, but I'm worried you wouldn't make it.
81) 13) dialog: We've been paid enough. The Chief nods, but Diana spots Charlie's hesitation.
81) 16) dialog: Ah!   Don't encourage him! Despite Sameer's protests, Charlie starts to SING LOUDLY but joyfully -- as the team moves on. OFF Diana, moved by the continued goodness she's discovering within these unlikely men.
82) 3) dialog: Wait. There's a whole island of women like her? And not a single man among them? (beat)
82) 8) dialog: And she thinks Ludendorff is Ares? The God of War?
