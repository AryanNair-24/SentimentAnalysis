26) 0) text: Diana drags the Pilot onto the beach, his bag around his shoulder. She gently lays him on the sand and gets her first real look at the FIRST MAN SHE'S EVER SEEN. His mouth, lips, jaw, hair, stubble -- captivating. This is CAPTAIN STEVE TREVOR (30s), rugged, handsome. American fighter pilot undercover for the British. Steve wakes, squinting in the sun, surprised to discover Diana's not a hallucination. He takes in the strange surroundings, blown back by her breathtaking beauty.
26) 1) dialog: Wow. She backs away as he sits up, surprised by the timber of his voice. Diana studies his eyes. They're so blue.
26) 3) dialog: Yes, I mean -- (lowering his voice)
26) 6) dialog: Thema-- say it again?
26) 8) dialog: I'm one of the good guys, and those are the bad guys. The wounded battle-cruiser sinks, but her THREE GERMAN LANDING CRAFT steam towards the beach.
26) 9) dialog: Y'know... Germans.
26) 14) dialog: We gotta get out of here.
26) 18) dialog: Where are their guns? ANOTHER WAVE OF GUARDSWOMEN arrive behind Hippolyta on HORSEBACK, aiming ARROWS at the German ships.
26) 19) dialog: Do they only have arrows? We need guns. Because the Germans have guns. Lots and lots of -- A torrent of FLAMING ARROWS sail from the cliff top, over Diana's and Steve's heads, hitting all three landing craft. The Germans FIRE back in retaliation!
26) 20) dialog: Get down! Steve pulls Diana behind a ROCK FORMATION, out of sight of the invading Germans now fanning out across the beach. MORE AMAZONS join the others on the cliff, led by ORANA. Orana shoots a GRAPPLING ARROW into the rock wall of the opposite cliff. She swings down the attached line toward the beach, firing ARROW AFTER ARROW at the Germans. ON THE BEACH:   Diana and Steve watch her, stunned. Diana turns as a soldier lifts his rifle and FIRES. She sees the BULLET leave the gun, heading straight for her in SLOW MOTION -- Steve TACKLES DIANA, pushing her to the ground as the BULLET just misses her.
26) 25) dialog: (to Diana)
26) 26) text: Stay here! A GLINT of a KNIFE in Steve's hand as he leaps on the soldier, dragging him down -- then quickly reappearing, SHOOTING a RIFLE. Diana grabs the SWORD and SHIELD of a fallen sister and joins the battle. She's quickly surrounded, but holds her own, fending off a SWARM of Germans.
26) 34) dialog: Diana! Steve aims at the soldier as he fires, but Antiope steps in front of her niece. TAKING THE BULLET, she falls to the ground. Steve fires and the German falls, too.
26) 48) dialog: They weren't my people.
26) 51) dialog: I -- I'm not at liberty to say.
26) 53) dialog: I can't tell you that, either.

27) 2) dialog: Seconded... to British Intelligence. (re: lasso)
27) 7) dialog: Whoever you are, you're in enough danger as it is. You shouldn't --
27) 12) dialog: (exhales; caves) I'm a spy.
27) 16) dialog: British Intelligence got word that the leader of the German Army, General Ludendorff, was visiting a secret military installation in the Ottoman Empire.
27) 18) dialog: I posed as one of their pilots, then flew in with them.
28) 0) text: Steve follows the others into the warehouse.
28) 1) dialog: According to our intel, the Germans had no troops left, no money, no munitions of any kind...
28) 2) text: Steve discovers this is an immense MUNITIONS FACTORY manned by elderly men, women, and children, all of whom appear to be slave labor for the Germans in the mass production of BOMBS.
28) 3) dialog: ... but our intel was wrong. The Germans had the Turks making bombs for them. And not just bombs...
28) 8) dialog: New weapons. Invented by Ludendorff's chief psychopath. Dr. Isabel Maru. Steve can't help but stare admiringly... until Maru turns her head, revealing METAL PLATES on her face, hiding damage incurred by her own experiments.
28) 9) dialog: Boys in the trenches call her `Dr. Poison.' Maru leads LUDENDORFF to her lab, to a fully-enclosed TEST CHAMBER with a VIEWING WINDOW. In the chamber, Steve sees a gruesome site: A PRISONER, his terrified face covered by a GAS MASK, his wrists and ankles stretched out and restrained by CHAINS. Another CHAIN leads from the top of the prisoner's gas mask. Out of earshot, Steve watches as Maru shows Ludendorff the formulas in her notebook, explaining them. Maru closes the notebook and sets it down, then releases GLOWING GAS into the chamber. Panicked, the prisoner's terrified eyes widen, MUFFLED SCREAMS cry out behind his gas mask. Enraptured, Maru puts a hand against the window, her anxious eyes follow the SMOKE filling the chamber: It has to work this time. Ludendorff watches, waiting. Steve looks on in horror as the prisoner's gas mask begins to show slight signs of disintegration: thin cracks in the glass, wear on the straps, corrosion on the metal -- Maru isn't even aware she's grinning, but then - The prisoner realizes the gas mask is resisting the gas, protecting him. He calms. Maru's face falls. Her eyes dart to Ludendorff who shows obvious signs of disappointment. Steve watches as a frustrated Dr. Maru pulls a LEVER -- and the chain connected to the prisoner's gas mask tears the mask off, exposing him to what's left of the gas! The panicked prisoner screams in pain as he breathes in, dying horribly! Steve can barely watch, he glances away -- and his eyes lock on Maru's notebook.
28) 13) dialog: From what I saw... if Dr. Maru was able to complete her work, millions would die. The war would never end. (beat)
28) 14) text: I had to do something... Steve makes a decision, knowing it could cost him his life -- he grabs the notebook.
28) 15) dialog: Dammit. Maru turns to see her notebook gone! She looks around just in time to see Steve leaving. They lock eyes briefly as he exits --

31) 0) text: Steve uses the Fokker's 12-BARREL ROTARY CANNON to FIRE on Ludendorff's vehicle -- but it gets away. Steve trains the gun on the evacuated military installation's glass roof, whose WORKERS have just evacuated. He STRAFES it, taking out all of the glass panes before dropping HAND-BOMBS into the complex. The factory EXPLODES in a fire ball as he flies off into the sky! END FLASHBACK.
32) 0) text: Steve tries to resist the lasso again, but can't --
32) 4) dialog: I was on my way back to London when the Germans shot me down... Steve's eyes firmly on his BAG at Hippolyta's feet. Diana removes Dr. Maru's notebook.
32) 5) dialog: But if I can get those notes to British Intelligence in time, it might make a difference... (emotional)
32) 8) dialog: ... The War to End All Wars.   Four years, twenty-seven nations, twenty-five million dead -- soldiers... and civilians... Steve swallows hard, forced by the lasso to reveal all. Not just the facts, but also his feelings about them.
32) 9) dialog: (with difficulty)
32) 11) text: ... like the world is going to end. Steve's head hangs low, Diana looks at him with sympathy and sadness.
35) 0) text: Diana enters to find Steve stepping out of a TUB -- his back to her -- NAKED. She studies his body as he towels himself dry. Steve's shoulder has been BANDAGED, but his body is covered with CUTS, BRUISES, SCARS from other battles. Diana touches her own wound, sympathetic. Steve finally turns, startled to see her there.
35) 1) dialog: Didn't hear you come in./Didn't hear you knock. Diana stares at him.   Puzzled.   Steve isn't enjoying th look on her face.
35) 3) dialog: I like to think of myself as... above average.
35) 5) dialog: It's a watch.
35) 10) dialog: My father gave it to me. Been through hell and back with him, and now me, and it's still ticking.
35) 13) dialog: Because it tells time. (off her look)
35) 16) text: You let this little thing tell you what to do? Steve takes the watch from her, covers up.
35) 17) dialog: Do you mind if I ask you a couple hundred questions? Diana shrugs.
35) 18) dialog: What is this place?
35) 20) dialog: I caught that before. I mean what is this place? How come I've never heard of it? Who the hell are you people? How do you know English?
35) 22) dialog: Funny, because I understand even less now than before you walked in. The way Steve watches her makes Diana self-conscious.
35) 26) dialog: Hey, I didn't get to say it earlier... but thanks for dragging me out of the water.
35) 28) dialog: So... Are you here to let me go?
35) 31) dialog: The Amazons?
35) 33) dialog: Can't say I blame her. (off Diana's surprise)
35) 36) dialog: I don't think want is the word, but... I've gotta try. (wistful; remembering his father)
35) 42) dialog: `You see something wrong in the world, you can either do nothing, or you can do something. And you already tried nothing.' Moved, Diana takes that in.   Determination on her face.

40) 4) dialog: We're leaving in that?
40) 6) dialog: (a touch of bravado)
43) 0) text: A BREEZE moves through Diana's hair as she takes a breath, watching the island drift away, and in a SUDDEN FLICKER of fog -- it is gone. Bittersweet. She eyes Steve at the TILLER. He looks at his WATCH, still ticking, then pockets it.
43) 2) dialog: The war? Well, which part? The Eastern Front in France is 400 miles long -- from the Alps to the Atlantic. Then there's the Dolomites in Italy, Turks in Arabia -- there used to be a Russian Front but they quit last year so they could kill the Tzar and have a revolution.
43) 4) dialog: Who's that?
43) 6) dialog: Ares?   As in the God of War?
43) 12) dialog: Look, Princess, I like your spirit, and maybe you know something I don't, but this war is so sprawling, there's nothing the two of us can do about it. But we can try to get to the men who can.
43) 14) dialog: (as she's nuts)
43) 18) dialog: The great books. Those books explain why there are no men on that island? Or kids?
43) 23) dialog: Just you? (off her nod)
43) 26) dialog: Oh. Well, that's not how babies are made where I come from. Diana turns to Steve, moving closer.   The tension betwee them palpable. Diana gets close --
43) 28) dialog: I refer to more than that.
43) 30) dialog: (pleasantly surprised)
43) 33) dialog: All twelve, huh? (off her nod)
43) 34) text: You bring any of them with you? Steve moves closer to Diana.   She grins --
47) 1) dialog: Good morning. (beat)
47) 2) text: We got lucky, caught a ride.    Made good time. Over Steve's shoulder, Diana gets her first eye-popping view of industrialized LONDON (circa 1918).
47) 3) dialog: Welcome to jolly ol' London. Diana, awestruck, takes in the city's skyline.
47) 5) dialog: Eh.    It's not for everyone.
48) 1) dialog: Diana! Steve is working to keep up with Diana. She sees something she can barely fathom -- a MAN and WOMAN holding hands, very much in love. It's captivating.
48) 6) dialog: Well, because they're... together. Diana takes Steve's hand.   He lets it go.
48) 7) dialog: No, we're not together... I mean, like that. Look, we need to go this way.
48) 9) dialog: (points the opposite way)
48) 12) dialog: (pats his bag)
48) 15) dialog: (almost finds that endearing)

48) 19) dialog: I need to change. (to Diana)
48) 25) dialog: (sneaks a third glance)
48) 28) dialog: Because you aren't wearing any. Diana, confused, looks down at her armor, then looks around at the mostly overdressed women on the street.
48) 30) dialog: (how to say it?)
48) 33) dialog: And that one wasn't made out of clay. They move on, both unaware that they're being following by a MAN IN A SUIT.
48) 35) text: It's true! You're alive! 51   EXT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO. - DAY ETTA CANDY, Steve's loyal, cheeky, secretary spies Steve and Diana walking towards her.
48) 58) dialog: At least try it on. Diana, sighs, then starts to take off her cloak. Etta's eyes go wide. She rushes to stop Diana from removing it.
48) 69) text: I can't say that I blame it. 55    INT. SELFRIDGE &amp; CO. - MOMENTS LATER Steve walks up to Etta.   He's now dressed in his SUIT.
48) 70) dialog: Where is she?
48) 76) dialog: (to Etta)
48) 77) text: Etta, the whole point was to make her less conspicuous. Steve looks around the store, grabs a pair of GLASSES. He gently puts the glasses on Diana's face. Looks satisfied.
48) 82) dialog: It'll be safe. You can trust her. (beat)
49) 0) text: Diana and Steve walk down the street, the SUITED MAN from earlier follows them. He's suddenly distracted by the reappearance of the Suited Man from earlier, who confers with A SECOND SUITED MAN (SM #2).

50) 7) dialog: (to Diana)
50) 10) dialog: Or not. SM #2 and SM #3 FIRE! Diana RAISES BOTH BRACELETS, deflecting their bullets. Her technique is clumsy at first as she gets used to the torque, impact and SOUND. Steve takes out SM #1 while Diana grabs SM #3 as his LAST SHOT fires -- and lays him out with a blow. Diana deflects the last of SM #2's bullets as his gun runs EMPTY. Everyone is amazed, especially Steve --
50) 11) dialog: How'd you do that? She smiles as if to say, you ain't seen nothing yet -- The remaining THREE SUITED MEN rush Steve and Diana. Diana slams her fist into SM #2 while Steve takes on SM #4. Diana grabs the dazed SM #2 -- swings him around, crashing him into SM #5 hard -- and they're both down. spilt second later, Steve finishes taking out SM #4. The suited men run off, leaving only SM #1 behind. SM #1 stirs. Diana and Steve turn to see him make a run for it
51) 0) text: Diana follows Steve into an ASSEMBLY HALL, where an unruly group of men, MILITARY LEADERS and MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, shout down SIR PATRICK MORGAN (40s), kindly faced, a CANE at his side. Diana gazes across the hall like a tourist.

51) 6) dialog: (to Darnell; urgent whisper)
51) 8) dialog: (to the Colonels)
51) 10) text: Phillip! Phil! Darnell turns, amazed to see Steve there -- alive! Steve nods toward the door, then realizes the room has gone silent. Every eye in the hall is fixed on Diana, the only woman in a room that doesn't allow women. Diana, oblivious, looks up at Sir Patrick.
51) 12) text: Our only aim at this moment -- must be to achieve peace at any cost. The crowd GRUMBLES again, about a woman's presence there as much as Sir Patrick's rhetoric. Steve takes Diana's arm and leads her out of the auditorium, Darnell follows.
51) 15) dialog: That's why they won't let him speak.
51) 18) dialog: (shakes his head "no")

54) 6) text: Who is this woman? Darnell glares at Steve.   He'd like to know that, too.
54) 7) dialog: She's my... secretary. Having learned what a secretary is, Diana doesn't like being called one.
54) 13) dialog: She's a very good secretary.
54) 24) dialog: (alarmed; to Generals)
54) 32) dialog: Sir, I saw   this gas with my own eyes. All    the men on the front line could   die on both sides unless you   --
54) 35) dialog: Pull the troops out. Send me in. With some strategic support, I could take Ludendorff and his operation out myself.
54) 37) dialog: But, General -- Before Steve can argue further, Sir Patrick speaks up --
54) 43) dialog: Yes, sir.    I understand, sir. Diana blinks, confused, astonished, disappointed.
54) 45) dialog: (warning)
54) 49) dialog: She's with me.     With us.

55) 15) dialog: (speaking the truth)

56) 0) text: Steve and Diana move towards a shady PUB.    Diana squint doesn't like the look of this place.

57) 2) dialog: Relatively good.
57) 6) dialog: Which Prince was that? (grabs Sameer)
57) 14) dialog: Sameer.   This is Diana. Diana studies the man with suspicion. And rightly so. He, meanwhile, is infatuated with her, all charm and smiles.
57) 17) dialog: Sameer's a top undercover man. Can talk the skin off a cat in as many languages as you. Diana speaks Spanish.
57) 26) dialog: Where's Charlie? Sameer points at TWO MEN FIGHTING: a huge BRUISER beating the hell out of a smaller, younger man. Diana looks at the Bruiser and nods approvingly.
57) 28) dialog: That's not Charlie. The Bruiser lands a blow that knocks the smaller guy off his feet. Steve winces, nodding at the smaller guy.
57) 29) dialog: That's Charlie. The two GRUNT at one another in Scottish slang, but the Bruiser sees Charlie's got friends -- and quickly leaves. The surprisingly cheerful CHARLIE (30s) gets to his feet.

58) 50) dialog: I assume you're here to stop us.
58) 57) dialog: If there is another weapons facility, find it and destroy it. Along with Ludendorff and Maru. A dark understanding passes between them.    Sir Patrick nods.
58) 60) text: Run the mission, sir? He slides an envelope to Steve.
58) 63) dialog: Thank you, sir. Diana turns to Steve.
58) 65) dialog: I'll take you to the front, but I can't make any promises about finding `your friend' any more than I can Santa Claus.
59) 4) dialog: Train leaves in a few minutes. But Diana is engrossed with the joy around her. Steve looks around at what she's seeing, then back at her a beat longer than he would expect. Diana watches a MAN and his DAUGHTER walk away from an ICE CREAM VENDOR, eating an ICE CREAM CONE. Steve spots her eyeing the girl eating, curious.
59) 5) dialog: Hungry? Diana nods, smiling. Steve buys TWO ICE CREAM CONES. Hands her one. She examines it, delighted.

61) 1) dialog: We've got to get a move on.   Chief won't wait.
61) 3) dialog: Smuggler.   Very reputable. Diana looks at the ragtag team Steve's assembled, shakes her head.
61) 5) dialog: Careful, I might get offended.
61) 7) dialog: I went undercover and pretended to be something else, I shot people on your beach, and I smuggled a notebook. Liar, murderer, smuggler. (beat)
61) 8) text: You still coming? Diana's confusion only grows as Steve LEADS a reluctant Diana and the group away from the soldiers, down a different path.
62) 3) dialog: In this war?   Every kind.
63) 2) dialog: Chief! He embraces Steve, then nods and smiles to Sammy and Charlie.

IN A DITCH on the side of the road, TWO HORSES pulling a CART OF MUNITIONS (that has tipped) are stuck in the MUD. A SOLDIER whips the horses, trying to get them out.
69) 2) dialog: You wanted me to take you to the war. This is it. The front lines.
69) 14) text: We need to help these people. Steve looks across no man's land, shakes his head.
69) 15) dialog: We need to stay on mission.
69) 23) dialog: There's nothing we can do about that.
69) 25) dialog: This is no man's land, Diana. It means no man can cross it. This is the worst point on the entire front. This battalion has been here for nearly a year and they've barely gained an inch because on the other side are Germany's deadliest soldiers. Pointing machine guns at every square inch of this place. This is not something you can cross. It's not possible.
69) 27) dialog: We are doing something. We can't save every person in this war. Besides, it's not what we came here to do. She steps away from the group, turning away from them. Steve thinks she's upset. But when Diana turns back to Steve, he sees her face of determination, wearing --

75) 0) text: -- Diana lands on a nearby rooftop. Steve watches her run across it as he and the team head deeper into Veld, all in the same direction. Suddenly, Steve and the boys are pinned down from gunfire by a TANK. Charlie motions to a walkway between two buildings in front of the tank. The Chief throws a grenade -- Charlie shoots it, causing it to explode! The walkway falls, blocking the tank. Steve and the team make it to the center of the village to find a TANK surrounded by DOZENS OF SOLDIERS. Sammy throws more grenades, but it's not enough. The tank has them pinned down -- until -- Diana rushes the tank, BARRELING into its side like a bull -- the tank is thrown end-over-end across the town square! The soldiers react in shock.

The team scatters, trying to help the villagers. Steve motions up --

75) 13) text: Bloody scope... lens is cracked. But the lens looks fine. Steve tries to take a shot at the bell tower, but he can't do so without exposing himself to the shooter.
75) 15) dialog: There is if you jump!

The photograph sees our team imbuing a sense of pride and accomplishment. Steve's face is turned towards Diana's, with a look of something more than admiration. Moments later, Diana walks with Sameer. They look back at Charlie, head hung low, shaken. Charlie fumbles with his flask, dropping it.

78) 9) dialog: Actually, that gala's perfect cover --
78) 13) text: You shouldn't be worried about upsetting the peace accord. Ares would never let that happen... Steve motions her to please stop talking about "Ares." Then Diana, a terrible realization.
78) 14) dialog: What is it?
78) 16) dialog: Ares?    You mean Ludendorff. She turns and look at Trevor.
78) 19) dialog: Sir, this is our chance to find the gas and learn how Ludendorff plans on delivering it. Maybe our only chance. Our last chance --
78) 24) dialog: I'm sorry, sir, you're breaking up.
79) 0) text: The tables are crowded with VILLAGERS and all the food the Germans left behind. Beer flows. Tea lights twinkle. A FEMALE PIANIST plays, singing as couples dance. The atmosphere is warm and jovial. Diana and Steve stand at the edge of the crowd, unable to put the urgency of their mission aside and join in. Sameer approaches them with two tankards of ale.   Steve waves them off.
79) 1) dialog: Drinks later, Sameer. I need you to rustle up me a German uniform. Sameer puts the ale in front of Steve and Diana despite his protest.

79) 14) dialog: Interpretive?
79) 17) dialog: Excuse me?
79) 19) dialog: You're not going to the gala.
79) 21) dialog: Because you don't know how to dance, for one thing.
79) 23) text: I would argue that they don't know how to dance. Steve finally smiles and moves out onto the floor to join her. He takes her left hand and moves his arm around her waist. It's the first time they've touched. Which they're both keenly aware of.
79) 28) dialog: That's kinda the point.
79) 30) dialog: It's a snowfall.
79) 32) dialog: You're right. Diana rests her head on Steve's shoulder. Steve can't remember loving anything as much as this feeling.
79) 34) dialog: This and other things.
79) 39) dialog: I don't know.    They... make breakfast.
79) 41) dialog: Read the newspaper. Go to work -- (carefully)

79) 46) dialog: (wistful)
80) 0) text: Steve lays Diana gently down on the bed, brushing her hair from her neck and KISSING IT. Diana's eyes are wide and shocked by the ELECTRICITY of those LIPS ON HER SKIN.

82) 5) dialog: You're not their type.
82) 7) dialog: It's true... every word.
82) 12) text: You don't really believe all this rubbish, do ye? Steve wishes he does, but deep down he doesn't...
83) 0) text: Through the trees, still on HORSEBACK, Diana and the team see the WELL-GUARDED fortress that is German High Command. Steve uses FIELD GLASSES to survey the scene. Chauffeured LIMOUSINES go through a HEAVILY-GUARDED CHECKPOINT at the gate, behind it, a long line of cars delivering well-dressed GUESTS to the ENTRANCE of the chГўteau, a SINGLE SENTRY stationed there.
83) 1) dialog: How the hell are we gonna get in?
83) 6) dialog: It won't look at all suspicious when I come sauntering out of the woods on foot --
83) 8) dialog: You're not going in.     It's too --
83) 10) dialog: I know how to do stealth -- been doing it my whole life. I'll follow them to wherever they're working on the gas or better yet find out where it is.
83) 15) dialog: (beat)
83) 18) dialog: Diana, what you're wearing doesn't exactly qualify as `undercover.'
83) 21) dialog: (to Diana)
83) 24) dialog: You can't go into German High Command and kill anyone! You have to trust me, Diana. Suddenly, a gleaming, ROLLS-ROYCE LIMOUSINE pulls into the forest, The Chief in the driver's seat.
83) 25) dialog: (to The Chief)
83) 29) dialog: (pointedly)
84) 3) text: Steve... Steve in the back, decked out in his GERMAN UNIFORM.
84) 6) dialog: And your head's empty! He wants my invitation, you idiot!
84) 14) dialog: Keep the car running, Sahib.   And no joy riding. Sameer smirks, bows. Steve heads to the chГўteau, watching him bowing and blessing to Germans. Steve shakes his head as he enters...
85) 0) text: Diana, her cloak concealing her armor, watches from the shadows as Steve disappears inside. Frustrated, she searches the exterior of the chГўteau for another way in, but she's distracted by the insistent HONKING of a CAR HORN behind her. Diana turns to find a stunning, exquisitely dressed woman, FAUSTA GRABLES (30) in an extraordinary gown, leaning over her driver and honking the car's horn in a futile attempt to get the traffic moving again.
86) 0) text: Steve walks up the stairs, spotting the KAISER at the head of the RECEIVING LINE atop them. Ludendorff is next to him, talking intensely to Dr. Maru. As much as they try not to, people can't help but stare at Maru.
86) 8) dialog: (to Maru)
86) 9) text: Excuse me. Maru turns to face Steve, holding TWO GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE -- he offers her one.
86) 12) dialog: No, but I've been watching you. Following your career, I mean. You're Dr. Isabel Maru. The most talented chemist in the German Army. I'm a fan. Steve keeps one eye on Ludendorff.    Maru notices.   He covers --
86) 13) dialog: I hope I'm not crossing a line.    I hear you and General Ludendorff are very close.
86) 15) dialog: (flirting)
86) 21) dialog: A man who would show you the appreciation a genius like yourself deserves. Maru stares into the fire, captivated.
86) 22) dialog: I love fire, don't you? It's like a living act of entropy. The ultimate weapon of destruction, reminding us that, in the end, everything returns to the ash it once came from. There's something reassuring about it. (stares into Maru's eyes)
86) 23) text: I see all of that in your eyes. Maru can't help but stare back deeply into Steve's eyes, surprised to find her heart racing. For a brief moment, she's unsure of what she's feeling.
86) 24) dialog: Perhaps you could show me what you're working on. I hear it's extraordinary. Steve's about to get the answers he needs when -- DIANA, in Fausta's gown, MAKES HER ENTRANCE, at the top of the stairs -- her uniform underneath, the GODKILLER peeking out from the back of her dress, the hilt looking like a piece of JEWELRY. Heads turn at the stunning Amazon. Steve's completely torn, does he stay and gets his answers from Maru -- or stop Diana from getting to Ludendorff? Maru makes the decision for him --
86) 47) text: Enjoy the fireworks. Just as he turns his back on Diana, she reaches for her SWORD. She's about to draw it when -- Steve gets between them, facing her! He pulls Diana away from Ludendorff, taking her hand -- dancing with her as cover.
86) 49) dialog: You agreed to wait.
86) 51) dialog: You can't kill Ludendorff inside German High Command. The Armistice won't be signed.
86) 53) dialog: What if you're wrong, Diana?    What if there is no Ares?
86) 56) dialog: I can't let you do this.
87) 1) dialog: Diana! Diana starts running towards it when -- the sound of a MISSILE launching from the guardhouse. Then another. And another.
87) 2) dialog: The gas. Their eyes follow the PATH OF THE MISSILES -- she understands, horrified, see the target is --
88) 7) dialog: It was Ludendorff.
88) 10) dialog: Wherever he goes you follow him. Steve chases after Diana!
89) 2) dialog: Diana. Diana walks out to see -- Steve arrive, dismounting. Diana points at Steve, her blisters HEALING before his eyes.
89) 5) dialog: Diana, I'm sorry --
89) 10) dialog: (reaching out for her)
89) 15) text: But I see the truth now. It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted. It's you, too. It's all of you. Steve is rattled --
89) 17) text: I will find Ares and I will kill him. Steve sees a TRAIL OF SMOKE in the sky in the distance.
89) 18) dialog: It's a signal from The Chief. They followed Ludendorff -- Diana rides off in a fury.
89) 19) dialog: Diana?! Steve starts to get his horse, then sees an abandoned MOTORCYCLE on the road into town and changes his mind.

She heads towards Charlie, Sameer, and The Chief -- who are all at a FIRE Chief has set, used to create the SMOKE SIGNALS. He points to the top of a hill. She rushes past them and up the hill! Cresting the hill, we see an AIRFIELD -- she heads down towards it. Steve isn't far behind her, racing past the team!
96) 13) dialog: Diana! Steve is on the balcony below.
96) 14) dialog: Diana? Relieved she's okay, Steve sees Ludendorff's body on the edge. Diana turns to him, lost...
96) 16) dialog: Right... Then we've got to do something about it. She leaps down to Steve, eyes wide with shock.
96) 18) dialog: Diana, I'm sorry... I know you thought -- I hoped it, too -- but I knew --
96) 20) dialog: That it might not be that simple.
96) 25) dialog: Because maybe people aren't... just good, Diana. Ares or no Ares. Maybe it's... just them. She looks out at them. The truth slowly sinking in as she tries to understand -
96) 27) dialog: Diana, sometimes people are complicated -- Diana's disbelief begins to turn to anger.
96) 29) text: That's why she left. They don't deserve our help. Steve knows they're out of time.
96) 30) dialog: It's not about whether they deserve it or not. It's about what you believe. You think I don't get it? All I've seen out there? I wish I could tell you that there was one `bad guy' to blame. Maybe we're all to blame. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to do better. (beat)
96) 32) dialog: If we don't, they're going to kill thousands more.
96) 37) dialog: (beat)
96) 39) dialog: Please. We gotta go... (beat)
96) 40) text: I have to. It kills Steve to release her hand, but he has no choice. He has to. He does and can only look back, hoping she'll follow. Diana's left alone, everything she ever believed in destroyed. She watches as Steve runs off --

97) 3) dialog: We're on our own. Despite their hesitation and confusion about that, the team follows Steve towards the hangar --
98) 0) text: Diana takes in a breath, SMELLS the CHEMICALS in the air, HEARS the sounds across the AIRFIELD -- she has become hyper aware of the harshness of the world around her. Diana turns, seeing a FIGURE THROUGH the windows looking at Ludendorff's plans. For a brief moment, she thinks it's Steve.

MARU approaches the plane for inspection with MORE SOLDIERS. They retreat to the shadows!

120) 4) dialog: But we can stop that plane.
122) 2) dialog: No, if it crashes, it'll wipe out everyone for fifty square miles. We gotta ground it.
122) 4) text: Steve looks over at Diana then the plane -- and he realizes what he has to do...
122) 5) dialog: Is it flammable, Chief?
122) 7) dialog: I need you guys to clear me a path to that plane.

125) 14) text: If we go in there, we're not coming back. They share a look -- and then go anyway -- Steve leaps onto a ladder on the wing of the bomber, climbing up as the plane moves down the runway.

146) 33) dialog: No. It has to be me. I can save today, you can save the world. (beat)
146) 36) dialog: I love you. Diana looks down in her hands at Steve's watch. END FLASHBACK.
148) 0) text: The rain washes away the blackened smoke from the sky, DAWN breaking through the clouds. Diana looks around, the soldiers rousing, as if they were waking up from a nightmare, the better side of man returning. They pull their gas masks off. Dr. Maru has vanished. Diana gazes out over the battlefield, looking at the team, the Germans -- the last of the ASH swirling around her as the SUN RISES. The sunlight hits Diana's face... Diana looks at Steve's watch -- it's finally stopped ticking.
149) 6) text: Steve did that. Charlie, Sameer, and The Chief, cleaned and scrubbed and wearing suits, join Diana and Etta.
149) 13) text: I don't think so. Etta stops in front of a recently erected wall of WAR MEMORIAL PHOTOGRAPHS. Steve looks dashing, happy, and very much alive. Diana's already fighting tears.
150) 5) text: So I stay and I fight and I give for the love I know can be. This is my mission now. Forever. Diana takes Steve's watch from her pocket, turns it over in her hand twice, feels its smoothness. The watch has stopped -- and has been stopped since the moment Steve died. She places the watch beside the photograph. AT HER COMPUTER: Diana is typing an e-mail, BRUCE WAYNE's name the recipient: "Thanks for bringing him back to me." Just as Diana presses SEND, a news alert pops up on her screen. A fire has broken out in a downtown building, people trapped.
