4) 13) text: As if he heard, PHILLIP REID rounds the corner. He's kind faced, late thirties, dressed in an old-fashioned brown suit-and-vest. He's got the makings of a slight gut.
4) 15) dialog: Lynn, some of these new pieces are amazing! You've been doing great work lately. Fabulous stuff.
4) 18) dialog: It's my pleasure. (takes on an aristocratic air) You know how prestigious it is to once again be showcasing the great Lynn Blodgett at my gallery.
4) 22) dialog: If Picasso were still alive, I'd turn him down to get you.
4) 28) dialog: What do you think? Should we expect a crowd tonight?
6) 5) dialog: Here she comes!
6) 11) dialog: Your new admirer just purchased your most expensive piece, my dear.
6) 16) text: Phillip doesn't get it for a moment. Then he sees the blu on Lynn's cheek. He gets it.
6) 18) dialog: Oh. Oh...of course.
6) 27) dialog: I'm just, uh, I've got to get some tape from the other room.
11) 7) dialog: Lynn?
11) 12) dialog: You've had me worried sick. I've called ten times since eleven o'clock.
11) 16) dialog: You leave the exhibit with some strange man you don't even know, and you wonder why I'm worrying?
11) 20) dialog: Where have you been all this time?
11) 31) dialog: What? What happened?
11) 35) dialog: Lynn? Hello?
12) 2) text: Phillip, Amanda, and MR. PARRISH turn from one of Lynn's paintings toward her. Mr. Parrish is a distinguished olde man, dressed very well and holding a cane, though he does appear to need it.
12) 26) text: Lynn's expression says it all. How strange. Lynn looks to Phillip or Amanda for support. Neither says anything, but they're smiling. Like something else is coming.
12) 31) text: She's speechless for a moment. Even Phillip and Amanda ar shocked. They knew the guy was loaded, but that's more th even they expected.
12) 46) dialog: Lynn, could we speak to you for a moment?
12) 50) text: Phillip pulls her into the other room, leaving Mr. Parris gaze at her paintings.
12) 54) dialog: Make the time. You can't be too busy for that kind of money.
12) 58) dialog: You've got to think this through, Lynn. Can you imagine what this is going to do for your other paintings? For your reputation? Once people hear Mr. Parrish paid twenty thousand for one of your paintings, it will open the flood gates. You won't be consigned to showing your paintings in my gallery...you'll be all over the country.
12) 63) dialog: Of course you can.
12) 78) text: Neither Phillip nor Lynn know what she's talking about.
12) 84) dialog: What happened last night? I called the police but wouldn't tell me anything.
15) 7) dialog: What happened when I called you?
15) 15) dialog: You need to take it easy, Lynn. And I don't think that includes leaving with strange men at night.
15) 30) dialog: What exactly is supposed to happen at this mediation?
34) 2) text: Phillip's at the front desk doing paperwork. He sees her rushes over.
34) 4) dialog: Oh Lynn, I'm so sorry.
34) 9) dialog: You sure?
34) 13) dialog: About an hour ago. Some detective came by to ask questions.
34) 17) dialog: Yes. That was him.
34) 21) text: Phillip's concerned.
34) 23) dialog: Why would a detective be following you?
34) 27) dialog: That's strange...Oh, hey.
34) 29) dialog: I didn't show this to the detective. I hope I won't get in any trouble.
34) 33) dialog: Amanda sent us all an email last night.
34) 36) dialog: It's about Mr. Parrish. His father wasn't just a clown; he was a convicted child molester. One of the children disappeared, but they could never prove he had anything to do with it.
34) 40) dialog: The second page has some pictures.
34) 44) dialog: I'm sorry, I should have waited to show you--
34) 48) dialog: If you don't want to paint for him, I understand.
34) 51) dialog: He can't do that...
34) 54) text: The PHONE RINGING interrupts her. Phillip answers it.
34) 56) dialog: Flinner Gallery. Oh, hello Mr. Flynn...
34) 59) dialog: No, I haven't seen her today. (beat) I'll tell her you called when I see her. Bye bye.
34) 62) dialog: What's that all about?
34) 66) dialog: Well...I don't think so.
34) 68) text: She puts up a finger to Phillip to give her a minute, and moves off to talk.
49) 1) text: Lynn, Phillip and Mr. Parrish are staring at a painting t is propped on an easel in the middle of the room. Mr. Par stares in wonder.
49) 7) text: Phillip takes the painting off to wrap it. Mr. Parrish pu his checkbook out and begins writing. He finishes, signin his name with a flourish.
49) 17) text: Mr. Parrish walks to the front door to where Phillip is waiting with his painting.
49) 22) dialog: Wow. Home run, Lynn.
49) 27) dialog: What?
49) 30) text: The PHONE RINGS. Phillip gets it.
49) 32) dialog: Hello? Mr. Flynn?
49) 35) dialog: Hold on please.
50) 1) text: Phillip is busy in the kitchen making what looks to be an elaborate meal. He checks in one of his cabinets for nood none there. He begins to go downstairs to get some but something in h backyard catches his eye. There's someone out there stand in the shadow of a tree.
50) 2) text: Phillip frowns. From his vantage it's hard to see anythin
50) 4) text: He's got a slightly better view, but it's still not great The person almost looks like...a clown. Phillip draws bac away from the window, frowning.
50) 6) text: Has to blink once. The clown is gone. Unless...Phillip tr to peer around to see if the clown is behind the tree, bu doesn't look like it.
50) 7) text: Phillip leans back again and doesn't see the clown starin the side window at him.
67) 7) dialog: (weak, barely audible) Lynn...Lynn...
67) 8) text: The line goes dead. Lynn looks at her car clock: 3:32 Lynn has a terrible thought. What if the clown went to Phillip's like he did to Julie's? She dials the phone, ge a BUSY signal.
67) 11) text: She turns down a side street, headed toward Phillip's.
68) 1) text: Not many lights on at Phillip's house. Lynn looks at Nick still asleep, then back to Phillip's. Nothing looks amiss Phillip could be asleep. Maybe it was nothing...
68) 12) text: She moves in, completely expecting to find Phillip's body the phone in her hand forgotten. Bracing herself for what she's about to find.
68) 14) dialog: Lynn?
68) 17) dialog: I heard it on the police scanner.
68) 20) text: Phillip turns, but the face that meets her is nightmarish His face is roughly painted, like he did it himself. He l like the shark-toothed clown from one of her paintings. L recoils, confused.
68) 23) dialog: He didn't kill you. I had my doubts; he wasn't the brightest bulb, was he? I think he actually believed it was his parents that your dad drove off the road.
68) 26) text: Phillip strolls into the kitchen.
68) 28) dialog: I'm not one for long explanations. Suffice it to say I've been keeping my eye on you for a long time now. Over twenty years. There was a time I thought I could simply forget what you did...
68) 31) dialog: Of course, that didn't last. And now...now, you're going to move away? You think you can get away from me now?
68) 36) dialog: I see it like it was yesterday. I was twelve. Sitting on the bench in the waiting area. Doctors rushing around...hurt, sick people everywhere. That awful smell...
68) 38) dialog: And what I keep remembering--it haunts me in my sleep--was those policemen who walked by. (mimics one) "The little girl, she distracted him. Drove right into them."
68) 41) dialog: I knew Bert, you know. He treated me for years. That's how I met Doug--the clown. He was so nuts that it didn't take much to convince him that killing you would make him all better. Of course, he was a loaded gun. He came after me tonight, but...I straightened him out.
68) 44) dialog: Don't worry, you can ask your dad what I'm talking about when you visit him in hell.
68) 47) text: Lynn's trying to stay cool even though she's deathly frightened of the way Phillip looks, the clown makeup covering his face.
68) 51) dialog: Do you?
68) 55) dialog: Then please...let me stab you.
68) 60) dialog: Stop calling me that. My name is Shane.
68) 63) dialog: Would you like to know why you're so afraid of clowns?
68) 66) dialog: At the hospital, some vapid nurse told you your parents were never coming back so you started crying. There was a clown at the hospital trying to cheer up the kids that day and...he came up behind you and touched your shoulder. I guess he was trying to make you smile. But...you saw him and wouldn't stop screaming bloody murder. (beat) Isn't it interesting how that one moment has shaped the rest of your life?
68) 70) dialog: Yes.
68) 75) dialog: FUCK you, Lynn! What about my parents? What about ME?
68) 86) text: Phillip bursts out the door, furious. He sees her car, th she's not in it. He turns to look the other direction as stands up with the right key in her hand.
68) 89) text: Phillip slides off and hits the driveway painfully. Lynn braked her car short of the road. She puts it in park. St at Phillip as he slowly stands up.
68) 91) text: Phillip is walking toward the car now. Twenty feet away.
68) 93) text: Phillip is fifteen feet away and closing.
68) 95) text: She stomps on a pedal and her car surges forward. Phillip time to raise the knife before the car hits him, tossing back into the yard like a rag doll.
68) 96) text: She checks on Nicky--still buckled up and unbelievably st asleep. Back to front where Phillip lies in an unmoving h
