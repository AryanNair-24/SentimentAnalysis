10) 17) dialog: Yeah, of course. You think I’m gonna give Sunglass Hut another thirty dollars for these? You crazy? Hey, how you doing?
10) 20) dialog: This? This was a gift. We watching “Downton Abbey” later? 27.
10) 22) dialog: What? Listen I’m watching it tonight. Cause I’m not going to practice in the morning and all the guys are talking about it and I’m left out.

24) 7) dialog: My boy got intimate. Sexual intercourse.
24) 9) dialog: My boy’s got a girlfriend. It’s been forever.
24) 11) dialog: It’s been like six years since Sheila and that only lasted like five weeks.
24) 13) dialog: Debbie didn’t even tell you where she lived.
24) 15) dialog: What I’m saying is you gotta go for it. Focus if you wanna take it to the next level. You got to give it everything if you want this one. When I lost the championship in 2011, I worked on my game twice as hard. Worked on my post-up game. And we won the championship. Twice.
24) 17) dialog: You gotta take a risk. Like when I decided to go back to Cleveland, I wasn’t totally sure they were gonna welcome me back. But they did. They welcomed me with open arms and an open heart.

24) 35) dialog: Two Cokes.
24) 37) dialog: I told you the refills weren’t free. 60.
24) 39) dialog: Why do I have to pick up the check?
24) 41) dialog: Don’t look at me different just cause I got a little money. I don’t how long this could last. Anything could happen. I’m not gonna end up like MC Hammer. You owe thirty two dollars and forty three cents.
24) 43) dialog: No. Just pay your part. It’s better for our friendship. Equals forever.
24) 46) dialog: I think I left my wallet in the car.
24) 48) dialog: It’s right in the car.
29) 2) dialog: Hi, I’m LeBron James and welcome to the Big Apple Jam Fest! Are you guys ready to have some fun? We hear an announcement over the speaker “And now the Kni City Dancers!” Infuriatingly tiny, hot dancers take cente court and do a dance. Amy is grossed out.
29) 16) dialog: Thanks. But seriously, what’s the deal here? What are your intentions?
29) 18) dialog: With my boy. What’s your plan?
29) 20) dialog: You get butterflies when you hear his name?
29) 22) dialog: When you look in the clouds, do you see his face? Do you hear his name when you listen to the wind?

35) 5) dialog: You?
35) 7) dialog: You using protection?
35) 9) dialog: Condoms? I’m talking protection. About a lawyer, non disclosure agreement. No penetration without representation. He dunks on Aaron again.
35) 11) dialog: Because you don’t want a baby mama. Next thing you know you’re paying for her Ferrari, a mansion. She’s gonna want to start a jumpsuit line and you’re gonna have to pay for it. Do you wanna go through that? Convince one of your friends to say he’s the dad and raise the child. Who wants to go through that? Kid ends up being six seven, your friend’s only five two. Eighteen years later the kid comes and writes a book about you saying how big of a jackass you are. Eighteen years. Your baby momma’s car and crib is bigger than his. You can turn on the TV any given Sunday, win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai. She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money, then she went to the doctor to get lypo with your money.
35) 13) dialog: It’s Kanye.
35) 15) dialog: Damnit.
57) 18) dialog: Aaron? It’s Lebron. I’m at the gym. I think I pulled something. I need you to come down. It hurts like a mother.

58) 33) dialog: Aaron.
58) 36) dialog: Yeah, if things would’ve went better. EXT. KIM’S HOUSE - DAY Amy knocks at the door. Kim opens it. INT. KIM’S SUNROOM - DAY Amy and Kim sit on Kim’s couch.
