No athlete wants to go under the knife. But when you do, you feel comfortable with Dr. Conners. He's not just changing professional athletes and the way they look at medicine. He’s changing the world and he’s helping everybody. From pandemics to war torn regions to extreme poverty situations, they feel safe in his hands. To our MVP and to my good friend, Dr. Aaron Conners. Everyone applauds. Aaron kisses Amy.
