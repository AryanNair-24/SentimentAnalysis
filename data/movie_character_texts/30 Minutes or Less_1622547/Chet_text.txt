8) 1) dialog: What the hell? Have you just been sitting there?
8) 3) dialog: Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure me on a weeknight, in her car no less...I'm not gonna make her feel like an untouchable. I'm gonna make her feel like a lady.
8) 6) dialog: By the way, she said she had a friend. Maybe we can go on our first double date since you tried to talk Jackie Fortunato and her cousin into having a four-way with us.
8) 14) dialog: I choose sleep. I gotta teach a class at eight.
8) 18) dialog: Come on, man, you know I got promoted to full-time last month. You bought me a laser pointer.
8) 23) dialog: I also get healthcare and my summers off. It's not perfect, but it's a career.
8) 31) dialog: I just got head. I'm totally Riggs. Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.
9) 0) text: Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couc His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a por Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazine to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover - It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions e a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of t glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young. Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet a high school graduation, looking just as young. They have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Wi and the girl look very high and very happy. Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee ta debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.
19) 10) dialog: Maybe you should pace yourself. It's noon on a Saturday.
19) 17) dialog: Yeah, he used to kick our asses.
19) 21) dialog: I hope he chokes on a dick. I never liked him.
19) 26) dialog: What the fuck are you talking about? I don't want that shit in my head.
19) 30) dialog: You two were swapping stories about getting fingered? That's pretty cute.
19) 35) dialog: Whatever. Why the fuck are we talking about who my sister goes out with?
19) 38) dialog: You sneaky son of a bitch...you want to fuck my sister, don't you?
19) 42) dialog: My twin sister!? Which is basically like fucking me!
19) 46) dialog: We look exactly alike!
19) 50) dialog: This is so fucked up I can't even begin to process it. How long has this been going on?
19) 54) dialog: So all those sleepovers, they were just some kind of opportunity for you to peek in Kate's bedroom?
19) 58) dialog: You're a peeping Tom. You realize that, don't you? You're a sexual fucking deviant.
19) 62) dialog: You? An adult? Sort of stretching the term.
19) 66) dialog: Take back? Will, you got kicked out of junior college for punching a professor that made fun of some poem you wrote.
19) 70) dialog: That is, literally, the saddest thing I have ever heard. Like retards playing freeze tag sad. No wonder you deliver pizzas for a living.
19) 74) dialog: Whatever. I only started hanging out with you because you had a Nintendo.
19) 79) dialog: Okay. You wanna do this?
19) 83) dialog: Well, you know who I saw naked? Jenny Rifkin. While I was nailing her. The week after she dumped you.
19) 87) dialog: Why do you think every time you wanna bet on whose cock's bigger I'm always willing to go in? 'Cause I know mine's bigger. 'Cause she told me!
19) 91) dialog: My grandpa left me that ball in his will! You helped me look for it for a month!
19) 99) dialog: Not quite yet. There's actually a mystery I wanna solve for you.
19) 105) dialog: Krav Maga, bitch. I bet your poetry professor didn't know this shit.
19) 109) dialog: You threw the first punch! 25.
19) 113) dialog: Try it!
19) 118) dialog: My knuckle in your spine! No holds barred you backstabbing fuck!
19) 122) dialog: Good!
19) 127) dialog: Let me tell you something. And it's the truest thing you'll ever hear, from the person who knows you best in the world...you're not good enough for my sister. And you never will be. You're the lowest common denominator, Will. You're the square root of fucking zero.
19) 133) dialog: Get out of my house. You're a shitty friend.
28) 4) dialog: This whole region here, about 830 thousand square miles, was part of the initial Louisiana Purchase.
28) 11) dialog: Take out your workbooks. Chapter 3.
28) 14) dialog: What do you want?
28) 18) dialog: I'm working here. Do not mess with me at work. 34.
30) 3) dialog: You wanna apologize, don't you? You look like shit. You've probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were. Well, it's gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling -
30) 8) dialog: Then what do you want? Because we don't have anything left to say to each other.
30) 14) dialog: You're hysterical. Got me. Great joke. I'm going back to work now.
30) 17) dialog: What the fuck? Is that real?
30) 21) dialog: Stay away from me! What the fuck are you involved in!? Terrorism!?
30) 25) dialog: Yes! One of the dumb ones! The ones they convince to wear the bombs!
30) 29) dialog: Seriously?
30) 33) dialog: And your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children?
30) 37) dialog: Just back the fuck away from me with that thing.
30) 42) dialog: Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe? There's no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design!? 36.
30) 46) dialog: For what?
30) 51) dialog: Damn it! (takes a breath) I'd like to tell you to get fucked, but you know what the problem is...I'm a better man than you. And someday, I might actually forgive you. So if I let you blow up, or whatever, that shit might come back and eat at my conscience, and totally affect my relationships with other people. Like my wife and kids and shit.
30) 57) dialog: Are you sure that thing isn't gonna blow at any second?
30) 60) dialog: Could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while?
31) 3) dialog: Yes, I'm still here. I really am this stupid. Just pay attention to where you're going.
31) 7) dialog: These floors get waxed once a week. On Tuesday, which today is. You hit a slick patch, trip and fall, and I got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out.
31) 11) dialog: Obviously.
31) 16) dialog: Do you really want to debate this?
31) 21) dialog: You're an asshole.
31) 28) dialog: Kristi Evans. Why?
31) 32) dialog: Oh, come on. Just keep walking.
31) 37) dialog: Fuck you. She's in the eighth grade.
31) 41) dialog: She doesn't call me "Mr. Chet." She's not a foreigner.
32) 3) dialog: ...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll call you after I talk to the doctor.
32) 6) dialog: So, this is it?
32) 10) dialog: Once I step inside this car, I'm basically in a steel coffin with you and...that thing. And if it goes off, all they're gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb. They'll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up. It'll be all over the news. Next thing you now, some militia or Islam group is claiming us as members. My family will be humiliated.
32) 14) dialog: Exactly!
32) 20) dialog: This is the world's biggest favor, you motherfucker. You didn't even help me move last winter.
33) 3) dialog: Given the situation, I think you should obey all traffic safety laws.
33) 10) dialog: I have no idea. I just got in your car. I thought you had a plan. 40.
33) 14) dialog: No plan. I can't say I'm surprised.
33) 19) dialog: Maybe we should turn on the radio. See if the signal sets the bomb off. That would be an interesting experiment.
33) 22) dialog: Listen, let's just go back to my place. Figure out our options. Maybe you can get the vest off or something. I just don't want to do anything stupid.
33) 27) dialog: Holy fucking shit!
33) 33) dialog: Okay. Okay. Fuck!
33) 36) dialog: I'm cool now.
33) 41) dialog: Do what?
33) 45) dialog: It's in case I have to jump out.
33) 49) dialog: And if abandoning ship saves my life, then that laugh will be mine.
34) 10) dialog: What if we try to separate your shoulder? 42.
34) 14) dialog: Well, all these sites say different shit. There's not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community.
34) 20) dialog: I agree. We gotta call the cops, have them fly in the bomb squad or something.
34) 27) dialog: I don't know, Will...I guess you gotta rob the bank.
34) 32) dialog: It's gonna be okay.
34) 41) dialog: Pull yourself together!
34) 46) dialog: Sorry. Shit. I didn't mean to do that. But just listen to me now. You're not gonna die. You wanna know why? Because you know exactly how to rob a bank.
34) 50) dialog: Point Break.
34) 54) dialog: Yes. That movie is like a how-to guide for bank robberies. You just bust in. Masks. Guns. Move fast. Stick to the tellers and don't bother with the vault.
34) 58) dialog: Really? I applied for a job there like a year ago. 44.
34) 62) dialog: Yeah, so what? It's a good job. You get benefits.
34) 66) dialog: What kind of benefits do you get? Free toppings?
34) 70) dialog: Not exactly. They didn't hand me the security schematics with the application. But I sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes. I know what the place looks like.
34) 74) dialog: One. I think.
34) 78) dialog: It's a great start. You can do it.
34) 83) dialog: I was actually gonna stick to giving tips, ideas...motivational speeches. More of a consultant or advisory role.
34) 87) dialog: Are you gonna cry again?
34) 92) dialog: I should make you blow me.
34) 99) dialog: We're gonna rob a bank for 100 grand? Just leave the rest of the money sitting there? Why?
34) 104) dialog: I'm putting my life on the line for 100 grand...what does 100 grand even buy these days?
36) 5) dialog: Handguns.
36) 25) dialog: We'll pay cash.
38) 5) dialog: Are you really worried about your upholstery right now?
38) 12) dialog: It says it's fast drying.
38) 16) dialog: How would you know? You do a lot of graffiti? 50.
38) 20) dialog: We don't have time to sit around and literally watch paint dry. Aren't we going straight to the bank?
38) 25) dialog: What? No way! We've got a car.
38) 29) dialog: Well, I can't hotwire a fucking automobile, and neither can you.
38) 33) dialog: I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun. Let's steal a car from your parents' friends.
38) 38) dialog: You never should have told me! I was 13 years old. I couldn't process that kind of information. I had to tell someone else. (shakes his head) Fuck. I really am sorry about it. Okay? Despite what I said before. I was just a kid, but I messed up.
38) 43) dialog: That's it? You're not gonna apologize for selling my Cal Ripken ball?
38) 47) dialog: Thanks. Now I feel even worse.
38) 52) dialog: I appreciate that you tried to buy it back. So, thanks.
38) 55) dialog: We should probably get going.
38) 59) dialog: Fuck! Fuck! I just want this goddamn day to be over!
40) 6) dialog: Yeah. When we were teenagers. This is fucked.
40) 11) dialog: Sorry.
40) 14) dialog: You hear that?
40) 19) dialog: Mr. Fisher is coming!
40) 22) dialog: Oh shit, oh shit. Are the keys in there?
40) 27) dialog: What are you doing?
42) 3) dialog: That old man's got a heart condition! You could have killed him!
42) 8) dialog: Awesome. I'm stuck inside an even smaller car with you and a bomb.
42) 13) dialog: Could you just take it easy, we're doing fine on time.
42) 17) dialog: Do you have to take a piss first? Because I do.
42) 22) dialog: Are you for real? Did you really just ask me that? You salt-in-an- open-wound motherfucker!
42) 26) dialog: You're really gonna turn this into some sort of dying wish bullshit? 56.
42) 30) dialog: I don't think you are. I mean, apparently, you love my sister so much that you're willing to put her life in danger by going to see her with a bomb strapped to your chest.
49) 3) dialog: Did you tell her how you saw her naked when she was 13? That always works.
49) 7) dialog: Shut up. She was freaked out.
49) 11) dialog: By you. 62.
49) 15) dialog: I don't want you in the family. You bring very little to the table. I want her to be with someone awesome. A pro quarterback. A war hero. At the very least, someone I've never watched porn with.
49) 19) dialog: Not if I set that bomb off myself.
50) 6) dialog: I'm not feeling so good. I drank like three of those 5-Hour Energy drinks.
50) 12) dialog: What should I call you in there, like if I need to ask you to do something?
50) 16) dialog: I can tell you're not a black guy through the ski mask.
51) 6) dialog: No, get on the ground!
51) 26) dialog: All of you, back away from the counter and get out here! Anyone pushes a button and one of these people gets totally shot!
51) 41) dialog: Are you guys working together?
51) 64) dialog: This is fucked. That dude is gonna bleed out and we're gonna go to prison.
51) 92) dialog: Oh, shit. Sorry, Cruz.
51) 95) dialog: Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably scared right now, but if you go grab us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out of here. This will all be over and you'll be fine. You trust me?
51) 110) dialog: What the fuck was that about, Sandra? I thought we had something going! What happened to trust?
51) 117) dialog: Okay. That should be enough.
51) 135) dialog: Let's just get the fuck out of here.
52) 6) dialog: Don't shoot us!
52) 14) dialog: That was awesome.
55) 3) dialog: Shit! This is not cool!
55) 6) dialog: Maybe we should pull over and surrender.
55) 11) dialog: You don't do anything like this for a living! I am not a pizza, I am a man!
57) 8) dialog: Go! Go! Go!
57) 11) dialog: Stop! Stop! Stop! 71.
60) 9) dialog: 
60) 14) dialog: I thought you were gonna blow up.
60) 19) dialog: Awesome.
62) 5) dialog: What!?
62) 10) dialog: Ah! Get it out!
62) 14) dialog: Do it now! 73.
62) 19) dialog: Is it rusty? Am I gonna get tetanus?
62) 22) dialog: Why are you moving so slowly?
66) 5) dialog: I thought you hated this car.
67) 5) dialog: I told a bunch of people I was gonna shoot someone. I was like "you fucking move, and I will kill you where you stand!"
67) 10) dialog: I know. But shit did get pretty crazy.
67) 18) dialog: Me, neither.
67) 22) dialog: I messed up, too. I'm a dude who slept with his best friend's ex- girlfriend, and destroyed his parents' marriage, and sat on the sidelines watching his downward spiral. I'm a shitty human being. But I'm glad you know that now, because you can accept me for who I am.
67) 27) dialog: Woah! You still got a bomb on you.
68) 11) dialog: You were driving! I'm just an accomplice!
68) 14) dialog: I bet he had like eight kids. We have to find them and support his family forever.
74) 5) dialog: They tried to screw us. You're a liability. They were just gonna let you blow up.
76) 23) dialog: Don't tell him to push the button! Pull over! Pull over!
77) 3) dialog: Get me out of this car! 84.
78) 3) dialog: That was colossally stupid!
78) 7) dialog: Sure! That seems like a perfectly logical pattern of thought! I bet that's exactly what he'll do!
82) 3) dialog: It's been half an hour.
82) 7) dialog: In another 30 minutes I'm calling the bomb squad.
82) 10) dialog: These guys obviously aren't watching you anymore.
82) 14) dialog: I'll take the heat with you, Will.
82) 18) dialog: Thanks, man. 90.
82) 21) dialog: You offered.
82) 23) dialog: To fuck myself?
89) 3) dialog: Look at the upshot, while you're behind bars you can finally finish your degree. If I was there, too, it would just be a distraction.
90) 42) dialog: What happened?
90) 46) dialog: What the fuck does that mean!?
90) 50) dialog: Damn it! You had to go see her!
90) 54) dialog: We gotta get her back, Will. These guys are crazy.
94) 127) dialog: Not now. We gotta take off.
96) 6) dialog: Yeah, that was totally Will's fault. In case you want to factor that in while you're mulling over the whole relationship thing.
96) 10) dialog: This man has spied on you in the nude before!
96) 14) dialog: He's lying. He's trying to build a relationship on a foundation of lies. And it won't stand.
98) 6) dialog: Hurry up! He's already on us!
102) 7) dialog: "His time was up?" Were you thinking that up the whole day?
102) 11) dialog: 
102) 20) dialog: Yeah, Will. What does the future hold?
102) 27) dialog: Fucked up. Why does she get a share?
107) 4) dialog: Fucking nine dollars to use the internet.
107) 8) dialog: Police think it was that black guy. They found some kind of map in his car. And I'm sure racial profiling played a part.
107) 12) dialog: Nope. Guess it's time to head back.
107) 16) dialog: Why? So you have more time to delude my sister?
107) 21) dialog: You really think she's into you?
107) 27) dialog: You're gonna go fuck my sister now, aren't you?
107) 31) dialog: At the very least...be a considerate lover. Give pleasure, before taking pleasure.
