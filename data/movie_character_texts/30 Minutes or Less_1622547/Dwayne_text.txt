11) 4) dialog: Fruit motherfuckin' salad! 8.
11) 9) dialog: Boy, if you weren't such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something.
11) 13) dialog: I hear that. I taught myself how to eat pussy. And cut my own hair.
11) 16) dialog: This one's all me. (makes "radio" sounds) Mr. President, we have enemies at the gate. Give me the order. (more "radio" sounds) Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate with terrorists!
12) 3) dialog: Wanna make sure I get enough calories.
12) 7) dialog: It's obvious you don't know shit-all about physical fitness. You gotta bulk up first, then you slim down. I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I told you to watch Pumping Iron like a month ago. If you'd listened to me, maybe you'd know what the fuck I'm talking about.
13) 8) dialog: Check it out. I ain't afraid of Jason. I'm fucking him.
13) 18) dialog: Dad, we're watching a flick. We got 45 minutes and a potential 3D sex scene left. You're sorta coming in at the worst possible moment. 10.
13) 22) dialog: You gotta learn how to share the common space.
13) 27) dialog: Let's get outta here. This movie sucks anyway.
13) 32) dialog: 
13) 37) dialog: That's pretty fucking disturbing!
14) 3) dialog: Fuck The Major!
15) 5) dialog: - and he thinks he knows me. He don't know shit. I got ideas he could never dream of. I got plans bigger than his fucking house.
15) 11) dialog: She passed on.
15) 15) dialog: I wouldn't mind nursing on them titties, mamacita.
15) 19) dialog: I wish I could forget about that asshole for good. I'm just waiting around for him to drop dead. Don't wanna mess with my inheritance.
15) 24) dialog: When my dad got outta the service, he started buying lotto tickets. He'd play his dog tag numbers. In '91, the fucker won five million bucks. INSERT PHOTO: The Major holding a giant cardboard check.
15) 25) dialog: He had some health problems a few years back, and since then he's been burning through the money like an NBA draft pick. Probably only got a million or two left. But it's mine as soon as he kicks. Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narr mind working. She straddles Dwayne, tightly.
15) 27) dialog: That's right. And maybe I'll make you my queen. Let you polish my royal scepter.
15) 30) dialog: Hate him like the Steelers.
15) 36) dialog: Do what?
18) 6) dialog: What we have here is a classic "lesser of two evils" debate. You got one evil: me shaving a few years off The Major's shitty life. Then you got the other evil: The Major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser.
18) 11) dialog: You know, there's a reason I sleep 'til noon everyday. And it ain't 'cause I'm lazy. It's on account of me having so many goddamn dreams. Big ones. And once that money's mine, they're all gonna come true.
18) 14) dialog: Like I had this one dream last night. I was cruising through town in a Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was blowing through my hair, ruffling my open shirt. There was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me. And in the back seat, Jay...was you. Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys.
18) 18) dialog: It was only this once, Jay. To be honest, I didn't know what to make of it. So I consulted my dream book, and found out it means this: you're my road dog. You got my back.
18) 22) dialog: That's why I want to make you my partner.
18) 26) dialog: In crime. And business. You see, it ain't just about the inheritance money. It's about what I'm gonna do with it.
18) 29) dialog: I'm about to clue you in on something. And then you'll understand the true magnitude of what's at stake here. Are you ready?
18) 33) dialog: Then answer me this...what's this town missing? I'll give you a hint. It's a cash business, crawling with sexy bitches.
18) 38) dialog: No. A tanning salon.
18) 42) dialog: It's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring.
18) 46) dialog: Yes. And because of the bitches.
18) 50) dialog: I'm starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you. Maybe you sitting behind me doesn't mean you're my road dog. Maybe it means you're plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass.
18) 58) dialog: Here's a fact: they don't build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots. Shit, they got three different types of CSI on TV, just laying out how the police do their business...and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself.
18) 63) dialog: I was presented with an opportunity. I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal.
18) 67) dialog: Now we're addressing the real problem: how do we get the 100 grand? 'Cause once we get that, we get the million.
18) 71) dialog: And once we get the million, we will literally own this town and every single thing in it.
18) 75) dialog: Again, not quite thinking like a millionaire.
18) 80) dialog: Fuck hiring them, we could just force someone to rob a bank for us. Like with blackmail, or death threats, or -
18) 85) dialog: I was gonna say hypnotism...but I like that. It's out of the fucking box. We just strap one to some motherfucker's chest, like we did to those watermelons. Think you can you build some kinda bomb vest?
18) 89) dialog: I'm pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it. And the beauty of it is: we don't lose any sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.
18) 93) dialog: Yeah. The Major dies. But no one gets hurt.
18) 96) dialog: There's just one problem. Where do we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a kidnapping, then we're right back where we started...doing shit that's gonna get us caught.
18) 104) dialog: Sometimes fate just takes out its cock and slaps you in the face with it.
25) 19) dialog: Stop! We got a gun, you asshole!
25) 22) dialog: Fuck! Get him!
25) 30) dialog: Step one.
26) 3) dialog: You thought we were gonna rape you.
26) 7) dialog: Just shut up. The tape is there for a reason. 'Cause this next part is gonna take a measure of calm. Are you with me? Can you be calm?
26) 10) dialog: Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever- The-Fuck Street, right now you are wearing an explosive vest.
26) 13) dialog: Calm the fuck down!
26) 16) dialog: Now stay still and my associate will show you.
26) 22) dialog: For a fucking bomb. So don't trip over your shoelaces or anything. That thing's full of C-4. And the C is for chaos.
26) 26) dialog: Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy?
26) 32) dialog: You know where you are? You might as well be in space, motherfucker. Nobody can hear you scream.
26) 36) dialog: Not yet. But you're gonna go get us some.
26) 40) dialog: I want 100 thousand.
26) 44) dialog: The Donner-Wells National Bank on Charles Road. 30.
26) 48) dialog: Yeah, the one across the street from the Olive Garden.
26) 53) dialog: No, I don't have an account! You're gonna rob it!
26) 57) dialog: Figure it out. You got a bomb strapped to your chest. That's a start. It'll scare the fuck outta people. Maybe use your brain and go get a gun. Borrow one from a friend for all I care. It ain't rocket science.
26) 61) dialog: I would, but I'm already wearing this gorilla mask and you're already wearing that bomb.
26) 67) dialog: And it's on speed dial. So do what you gotta do, but we'll be watching.
26) 71) dialog: You go anywhere near a police station, and Fourth of July comes early this year.
26) 74) dialog: It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours.
26) 77) dialog: Once you have the money, call this number and you'll be given instructions on where to drop it. You do good, we give you the six-digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go back to delivering pizza, the mail, whatever the fuck you want.
26) 81) dialog: Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that? You don't have the money? It was too tough to rob the bank, so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch? Well, guess what my stuffed friend...time is up.
26) 85) dialog: I liked that bear. I don't even know you.
26) 88) dialog: Go on. Get outta here.
26) 92) dialog: Yeah, of course we can.
26) 95) dialog: Be careful!
26) 98) dialog: That's right! Get the fuck out of here! You're wasting time!
26) 103) dialog: It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50 bucks to put a firing pin in it. Now it goes boom.
26) 108) dialog: Don't you ever question me. I'm fucking this bitch. You're just holding the camera.
26) 113) dialog: Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines. This is cash money. You hesitate, you fuck up...and I will leave you behind.
26) 116) dialog: Let's go get some breakfast. 33.
37) 3) dialog: You really fucked up this mix tape.
37) 6) dialog: We're not speed freaks knocking off a 7-Eleven. We're masterminding a heist here.
37) 11) dialog: I wish he would hurry his shit up. 48.
37) 15) dialog: No, man. He picked him up at a school. So long as there ain't any cops, he can take the whole town with him. I just want my money.
37) 20) dialog: If you had any vision, Jay, you'd know exactly what I'm thinking about right now. And it's not a sandwich.
37) 26) dialog: I've been thinking about it, and I want you to start off working the counter. Sounds like a demotion, I know, but it's an important position. Because we're gonna be using code words and shit. For example, if a customer walks in and says he wants a tan, that just means he wants a tan. But if he says he wants a "deluxe tan," that means a blow job and you gotta get one of the girls in there to suck him off. You with me?
37) 30) dialog: There's gonna be codes for everything: missionary, anal, black chicks. I got it all written down back home in my files.
37) 34) dialog: I'm not gonna bother getting into it with you right now, because you're supposed to be on lookout and you're no good at multitasking.
37) 39) dialog: Fuck.
44) 3) dialog: Where the fuck is he going? What's in there? Some sort of FBI headquarters? I told that guy not to fuck around!
44) 6) dialog: Maybe I should give that bomb a call.
44) 11) dialog: I was just fucking around. Are you gay for this guy or something?
44) 15) dialog: All right. Then man up and go check it out.
44) 18) dialog: Don't even tell me you're about to do a reconnaissance without a cover. What's you cover?
44) 22) dialog: Yeah, nice fucking uniform.
44) 25) dialog: You're a personal shopper. You're delivering the latest fashions to Mr. Quilby in marketing. Got it?
44) 29) dialog: "He's got the whole world in his hands. He's got whole fucking world in his hands..."
48) 3) dialog: So?
48) 7) dialog: Getting one last blow job in case he don't make it. I kinda like this guy.
53) 0) text: Dwayne watches as the cars speed off into the distance.
53) 1) dialog: Holy shit! Our boy is causing some serious mayhem!
53) 3) dialog: Shut the fuck up! If you jinx this with your negativity, I'm gonna strap a bomb to your chest next. Jay massages his shoulder, pissed.
53) 7) dialog: You are!
65) 4) dialog: You hear what happened to the guys they were after? 74.
68) 3) dialog: This who I think it is?
68) 5) dialog: You know, you're a pretty funny guy.
68) 7) dialog: Now wait a second, you're the murderer.
68) 9) dialog: One of those cops who wrecked his car chasing you...he ain't breathing no more. Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet -
68) 19) dialog: I'm just messin' with you. You didn't kill anyone. How'd a moron like you manage to rob a bank?
68) 23) dialog: There's a boarded up gas station out on Commerce Avenue, past the highway. Be there in 30 minutes.
68) 27) dialog: Then you'll be standing around with your dick in one hand, and my money in the other.
68) 30) dialog: Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy. Money's on its way.
70) 3) dialog: I remember the summer after my mother passed was the first year they had the Monopoly game at McDonald's. I musta come here three times a day trying to collect all the game pieces. Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from all the grease. The Major said I was the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care, I just wanted to win the money and get the fuck out of there. So, one night, I followed this skinny register kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling on him, asking him where they were hiding the Park Place piece. The million dollar prize. But he didn't know shit. A year later, The Major won the lotto. I asked him for a Sega Genesis. He bought me one of those paddles with the ball attached. 78.
70) 6) dialog: I'm not ashamed to admit that I've gone through some dark times since then. Depression. Addiction to a variety of shit, which I won't go into. I know you must think that's pretty silly, especially since you manage to get through the day and you don't got shit going on as compared to me. But that's just the way it is. That's life.
70) 11) dialog: No. I don't. My whole point I was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past. 'Cause I did it. I finally pulled it off.
70) 15) dialog: Are we? Would you do anything to protect me, my money, my empire?
70) 21) dialog: Would you push the button?
70) 25) dialog: It's just a question, Jay. Would you? If I asked you?
70) 29) dialog: I mean, it's no different than those watermelons.
70) 33) dialog: Yeah, they are. Not the ones you blew up, though.
70) 38) dialog: Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part.
70) 41) dialog: Anyway, he hasn't even made the drop yet. I'm gonna go take a shit. Stay away from the bathroom. Someone could get hurt.
75) 4) dialog: Never comes out this nice when I do it myself. You might wanna take some more off the top, though. I wanna look real professional when I go down to the morgue to identify the body.
75) 7) dialog: You drop the money yet?
76) 10) dialog: I gave him the code. He told me he committed it to memory.
76) 14) dialog: He was probably just embarrassed that he forgot it. I'll call him up and -
76) 18) dialog: Hold on there, big man. You got a bomb on you. I got a cell phone that detonates it. You're not exactly negotiating from a position of leverage.
76) 26) dialog: Why don't you watch what the fuck you say! I own you! I tell you to rob a bank, and you rob a bank. I tell you to give me the money, and you give me the goddamn money and hope I show you some mercy.
76) 31) dialog: That piece of shit hung up on me!
79) 3) dialog: Does this guy know who the fuck I am!?
79) 8) dialog: We're not amateurs. He was a loose end. I let him live, someday I woulda been walking out of my mansion and... bam! FBI, CIA, NSA, all converging on my front lawn, 'cause a loose end turned state's evidence and they got what they need to put me away.
79) 11) dialog: Fuck it, Jay. I'll just kill The Major myself.
79) 17) dialog: You know what they say about a tree falling in the forest? Maybe the same thing applies to blowing up some motherfucker across town. Maybe it doesn't even make a sound.
79) 20) dialog: Boom.
79) 26) dialog: Who did I just call, Jay? 'Cause she sounded cute for a bomb.
79) 31) dialog: Where's the number for the bomb?
79) 35) dialog: I'm in perfect control!
79) 40) dialog: You asshole...I make you my partner and you pull this shit...
79) 42) dialog: Fuck you...I'm gonna piss blood, aren't I?
79) 44) dialog: Go on. Get it out for me. I can barely move. Jay pulls the cell from Dwayne's pocket...opens it and pu it to his ear so he can answer -
79) 45) dialog: Glad you came to your senses.
80) 10) dialog: That guy's not my boy. He's a dick. I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion. 87.
80) 14) dialog: I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking him. You gotta understand, you're like a pawn in a much larger game I'm playing here.
80) 18) dialog: I didn't mean it like that. I'm just juggling a whole lot of shit.
80) 22) dialog: That may not be possible.
81) 3) dialog: That's it. The assassin's gonna kill me now. I'm gonna die. Game fucking over.
81) 8) dialog: Why? So he can fuck around again, and I wind up dead, anyway? No. I'd rather just sit here. I want to die right here on this couch.
81) 12) dialog: How do we do that? Pizza boy's obviously got some kinda death wish.
81) 18) dialog: That's actually...that's a great fucking idea, Jay. It's the best idea anyone's had all day.
81) 24) dialog: Ok. Then let's do it right. We leave nothing to chance. Because if we go to prison for this, I won't be able to watch out for you.
81) 29) dialog: You should probably bring the flamethrower, buddy. There's gonna be some evidence to dispose of.
84) 9) dialog: What's the quietest way out of the building? 'Cause I might get excited in a confrontation, and you might wind up shot in the face.
90) 3) dialog: 
90) 8) dialog: That's the point. I want you on a short leash.
90) 12) dialog: Yeah, I'm sure. You just wanna go back to your fantastic life. Your great job. And that blonde bitch with the sexy voice.
90) 23) dialog: There are no lines! There's just me and you and 100 thousand dollars. Once we get that shit in order, you can have her back, and your life, too. So you're gonna show up where I say, when I say. Alone. And if you try anything stupid, the two of you will be delivering pizzas to Saint Peter.
90) 27) dialog: You got ten seconds.
90) 37) dialog: She's just really gonna die if you fuck this up.
94) 6) dialog: How much time you got left? 97.
94) 11) dialog: Damn. Maybe we should just wait around for the money shot.
94) 14) dialog: That the money?
94) 19) dialog: In the van. Maybe.
94) 30) dialog: This is a fucking tearjerker.
94) 34) dialog: I will. But you should know, my associate over there is packing a flamethrower.
94) 40) dialog: Unless either of you can outrun a 25- foot flame. (gestures to gun in his belt) Or a bullet.
94) 45) dialog: I gave you the girl. Now give me the money.
94) 49) dialog: Fair enough.
94) 52) dialog: 
94) 57) dialog: 
94) 62) dialog: It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?
94) 67) dialog: Okay, you can get out of here now.
94) 71) dialog: They say great minds think alike. And in this case, so do we.
94) 76) dialog: Do I look that dumb?
94) 84) dialog: Son of a bitch. Well played.
94) 98) dialog: It's all good. We got your money.
94) 103) dialog: Hold up. You don't have to do this. I just paid you.
94) 109) dialog: I don't know what you're talking about. Just take the money.
94) 113) dialog: I'm not a loose end!
94) 144) dialog: No!!
94) 150) dialog: Goddamn it, Jay!
94) 153) dialog: Stop, drop and roll!
94) 159) dialog: You didn't hesitate back there, Jay. You did good.
94) 162) dialog: I'm gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money. Think you can get outta here?
100) 3) dialog: I own this town.
106) 5) dialog: Dad?
106) 8) dialog: Dad, are you -
106) 13) dialog: What happened to you?
106) 17) dialog: Dad, I...I'd never... 107.
106) 21) dialog: I am a man! I killed you, didn't I? Now I'm gonna use your money to open a tanning salon where they let you fuck the chicks.
106) 27) dialog: Those were great bedtime stories.
106) 32) dialog: Sure thing, pop.
106) 39) dialog: Get up, you pussy! Come on, soldier!
107) 61) dialog: 
108) 3) dialog: Here at Major Tan, our specially trained technicians are hard at work developing new technologies that harness the power of the sun, to ensure a cutting-edge tanning experience.
108) 6) dialog: How's it looking?
108) 12) dialog: Hey, don't just take this scientist's word for it. The proof...
108) 15) dialog: ...is in the tan.
108) 18) dialog: But Major Tan isn't just about looking good. It's also about feeling good.
109) 3) dialog: So come on down to Major Tan...where we're proud to be a family business.
