40) 8) dialog: Call him back.
40) 10) dialog: HeвЂ™s five years old. They hate phones. Eliza, when you were that age youвЂ™d never talk on the phone.
40) 12) dialog: HeвЂ™s not a girl youвЂ™re trying to trick into dating you.
40) 14) dialog: It's always stiff after I've been sitting.
40) 16) dialog: It's my back.
40) 18) dialog: I don't have time to see a doctor now.
40) 20) dialog: I know what it is, OK?
40) 22) dialog: It's...I...I mean I basically KNOW.
40) 26) dialog: And call your son! Matt hesitates and slowly gets up to make the call.
40) 51) dialog: She texted you?
40) 54) dialog: Paul Epstein? I always liked Paul. Man, he's gotten older.

42) 1) dialog: Do we kick the shit out of him?
42) 3) dialog: That's true. Or hurt him very badly.
42) 5) dialog: That's for sure. (starting toward the room) I'm going to spit on him.
43) 2) dialog: Shit, this is MaureenвЂ™s dead exhusbandвЂ™s cane. Matt chucks the rock, cracking the windshield. the car repeatedly. They're loving it. They smash

47) 12) dialog: Well, he didn't have dementia when he molested Jean.
47) 14) dialog: (losing steam) But let's not minimize it, Jean. What he did was shitty and damaging and I don't know...that same asshole is in there somewhere... Right? Beneath the dementia.
47) 16) dialog: Do you want to take a swing?
47) 20) dialog: This toast is really stressing me out. Danny appears and hands Matt a champagne. Danny wears his leather jacket over a shirt and tie and khakis with a hummus stain on the fly. Jean passes by on her way to the bar.
47) 21) dialog: Jean, you sure you don't want to say anything? Fuck no.
47) 24) dialog: What will it do to me?

47) 30) dialog: What about Marcus?
47) 32) dialog: How do you know that--
47) 35) dialog: She's walking over here. Matt runs his hand through his hair. I look OK?

47) 50) dialog: Thanks, L.J. L.J. How's he doing? Where is he? coming to visit.
47) 51) dialog: (releasing L.J.) He's kind of in a coma in Pittsfield right now. L.J. (tears running down his face) I don't give a shit. Let's go tonight. I'm 126
47) 53) dialog: He'd love if you came even if he'll have no idea.
47) 55) dialog: (eagerly looks around) Where's Loretta? L.J. Her son got chicken-pox and she had to stay in town! She was very disappointed.
47) 56) dialog: (disappointed) That's too bad.
47) 58) dialog: (resolute) I'm going to. L.J. You'd like her boyfriend too. He's a good man. A screenwriter.
47) 61) dialog: I should never have left that opening at MOMA. It was just...Dad... I felt obligated.
47) 63) dialog: You would've stayed.
47) 65) dialog: No, he can't, Matt. That's why he's where he is now. (beating himself up) I should've been able to tell something was wrong. I just thought he was getting old...
47) 67) dialog: Do you think he's going to die?
47) 69) dialog: (shaking hands) Nice to meet you.
47) 71) dialog: Oh...OK. (to Eliza) You speak highly of me?
47) 73) dialog: Eliza, you've had two wines already, don't have a beer too.
47) 75) dialog: Eliza, it's not good to mix wine and beer. You'll feel cruddy tomorrow. I'm telling you.
47) 78) dialog: Please, just...stay out of this.
47) 80) dialog: I'm telling you, you're going to feel like crap. Eliza takes a swallow. Danny grabs the beer from her, and chucks it. Robin looks scared.
47) 83) dialog: Stop interfering with my parenting, Matt.
47) 85) dialog: This is something I do and I'm quite good at it, OK? She and I have a very good relationship when you're not around. So, stop... ganging up on me. Matt reaches out and takes Danny's shoulder.
47) 87) dialog: Yeah? Me too. You know, I've wanted to apologize for a long time. For what?
47) 89) dialog: I'm pissed at myself because when Dad kicked me out of the house and I moved back with my mom, you really made an effort to hang out and I kind of blew you off. And I feel like I fucked that up. I think it's really my fault that we're not close. Danny hugs Matt strangely.
47) 90) dialog: It was hard for me to be around Dad and your mom at that time too. They were so critical of me and I was just FAILING.
47) 92) dialog: (oddly) Are you disappointed in me?
47) 94) dialog: I know Dad is. But I felt like you maybe also were critical of me for quitting piano and-MATT No, no, no. You were my big brother, I looked up to you.
47) 95) dialog: I quit because it was my protest.
47) 99) dialog: And also...because it was like...it was like walking barefoot through broken glass to get to a milkshake. I loved the milkshake but, you know, my feet were...bleeding.
47) 101) dialog: Can you? Cause my feeling about you is you can't. It's not your fault but like Dad, you make me feel really bad about myself. I'm sorry.
47) 103) dialog: I said it's not your fault.
47) 105) dialog: Can I ask you something?
47) 107) dialog: A few years ago, when Karen and I had you over to our house when you were in town and I never heard from you afterwards. Maybe you didn't like the food or Karen or I insulted you in some way. Karen maybe had too much grappa-MATT No! That was nice. I went back to LA, I don't know.
47) 108) dialog: Were you bored? Most people seem to find us interesting enough, we've had no complaints.
47) 110) dialog: Well, even in life, you can make an effort. Write an e-mail from one of your phones. But, I guess you're fine making no effort with family. You say you have guilt, but...
47) 112) dialog: (emotional) It shouldn't come to that! And if Dad survives, you'll go back to LA and I'm going to be taking care of him for a very long time.
47) 114) dialog: No...we won't ALL. It'll be me. And Jean. And mainly me.
47) 116) dialog: That's what you said when you ate dinner with Karen and me. (walking away) You've made your priorities clear.
47) 118) dialog: Ptolemy asked me why you never talk Dad's work up to your wealthy clients. He says you could be really helpful, that it's all perception. You know, he's a good artist and there's no reason he isn't as well known as L.J.!
47) 120) dialog: No, it's what you DO.
47) 122) dialog: Why are you so angry at him anyway. He loves everything you do. Does he?
47) 124) dialog: He tells ME. I should be angry at him. I should hate him for treating me and Jean like second class citizens. 133
47) 127) dialog: Dad said this was a family discussion! Wait...did this...did this happen already? Yes.
47) 129) dialog: He told me weвЂ™d decide together. And you do this when he canвЂ™t say anything... He told me, Matt. You werenвЂ™t there.
47) 131) dialog: I donвЂ™t care about money. That house, that work MEANS something to me.
47) 133) dialog: Then why donвЂ™t you?
47) 138) dialog: Ptolemy said you guys make yourselves indispensable to vulnerable rich people.
47) 143) dialog: (now, just shouting insults) And you're doing with Tony just what Dad did with me and Jean. 135 Matt slaps Danny hard across the face then slips on the grass and lands on his ass. Danny tackles him and they topple onto the lawn hitting each other awkwardly. People emerge from the gallery. them. College kids surround

48) 4) dialog: Yes, thank you, Matthew. He holds out the mike for Danny to take. anticipating a punch. Danny flinches, 137
48) 6) dialog: Oh, I see, OK. Danny takes the mike. Eliza and Jean help Matt to a bench Now, Danny, also bloody, clothes torn, looks petrified. H hums an indecipherable tune. He leans on the back of a chair for support.
48) 7) dialog: You'll have to bear with me as I'm not a good public speaker and also I've never done it. It's something I've gone to great pains to avoid. When I used to perform music in front of an audience it was just too excruciating. The reward was just not worth the self-hatred. Not to mention, unlike my brother, Matthew, I find this particular piece painful because it was during a time I wasn't really speaking to my Dad. He had left my mother and Jean and me, gotten remarried to Matt's mom whom we did not like. Again, unlike Matt, I was NOT included in the art-making process, it wasn't MINE too... This piece is NOT called Danny. In fact, there are NO Danny's. Or Jeans!
48) 9) dialog: (nods) For me, it's a symbol of what I will NEVER be able to do. A club I will NEVER be admitted to. But Dad and I have gotten to spend more time together as adults and that's been good, I think we have gotten closer. We've certainly watched a lot of Mets games. Some of you know, my Dad is in a hospital in Pittsfield and we don't know how it's all going to go. Our doctor's in China and the only really good nurse got reassigned to a different floor. Maybe I need to believe my Dad was a genius because I don't want his life to be worthless. (MORE)
48) 11) dialog: If he's not a great artist, that means he was just a prick. I think he's good, though. I think he deserved more attention than he got. I think that's true. Matt? Matt, eyes bloodshot, face splotchy, shrugs.
48) 12) dialog: I wish he'd had more success because it would have made his life easier. Even if that kind of thing doesn't ultimately mean much. I don't know, L.J.? L.J. (shrugs) I don't know either. I'd tell you. If I did,
48) 13) dialog: Also, I'm really proud of my daughter, Eliza, who is a freshman here and a really talented filmmaker. Eliza's friends WHOOP. Eliza smiles, embarrassed.
48) 14) dialog: Thank you. (awkwardly) Peace. Danny drops the mike like a rapper.
49) 2) dialog: Hey, honey. She moves over to Danny's bedside and hugs him. Hi, Robin.
49) 3) dialog: 
49) 11) dialog: I'm bionic now. That's a reference for Jean only.
49) 18) dialog: And we can't find the doctor.
50) 2) dialog: That's you with the rabbit.
50) 4) dialog: You were so good.
50) 7) dialog: It's wonderful, honey. I don't know that I've seen a sex scene shot quite like that before.
50) 9) dialog: Well, that's difficult.
50) 11) dialog: Wonderful mise-en-scene.
50) 13) dialog: Yours had wonderful mise-en-scene as well, Jean. Thanks.
50) 15) dialog: And this is the best yet, Eliza.
50) 88) dialog: Hey, my broth-a.
50) 90) dialog: Thanks for paying for this. private room is...it's not necessary. The
50) 92) dialog: How is Dad?
50) 94) dialog: I said goodbye to him so many times in my head, it's strange, in a way, I wasn't prepared for him to survive.
50) 96) dialog: I just don't want to have to speak publicly again. You know, sometimes I wish Dad had done one horrible, unforgivable thing. Something specific I could be angry about. But it isn't one thing. It's tiny things every day. It's drip, drip, drip... 149
50) 98) dialog: (shrugs) I'm over it. I'm not.
50) 101) dialog: (takes them) I thought they were yours.
50) 103) dialog: No, I think you're right, they're mine.
50) 105) dialog: (pulling them away) They look like a pair I probably had. Danny puts them on. Matt regards him.
50) 107) dialog: Can you help me walk? The nurse is supposed to be here to do it, but I get antsy. Matt helps Danny climb out of the bed.
50) 109) dialog: It's good, right.
50) 111) dialog: Thanks. You know, I'm glad she likes you so much... Danny holds Matt's arm as he slowly walks.
50) 113) dialog: Oh...hmm...I love Los Angeles. I haven't been there, but I love it.
51) 2) dialog: Yeah, go be with your boy. (pause) Thanks for...you know, taking care of me.
51) 8) dialog: The famous blueberry pancakes. Danny does the flourish.
51) 10) dialog: How's her drinking?
51) 12) dialog: (unsure) Uh huh.
51) 14) dialog: You should have seen Matt, Dad, when you were sick. He was there the whole time, he really whipped us into shape. Harold gets up and walks into the living room. male nurse's aide who is cleaning up.
51) 16) dialog: You know, we were all there the whole time. Harold sits on the couch and presses the remote.
51) 18) dialog: It was rough there for a minute, we thought we might lose you.
51) 20) dialog: (giving up) Not really.
51) 23) dialog: You know, Matt invited me to LA.
51) 25) dialog: Have you ever been to LA?
51) 27) dialog: I know. I lived here while you were in the hospital. (MORE)
51) 29) dialog: (helps with a pillow) You'll have a nurse with you-HAROLD You know, I really need you to stay with me. I'm asking you to do this, please. You know I donвЂ™t like asking for things. I need you, Danny. OK.
51) 30) dialog: (hesitates)
51) 33) dialog: OK, thanks. He picks up the plate of cookies-HAROLD (O.S.) Pick a day. Except for next Saturday, L.J. is coming up for lunch, so you'll need to find something to do, but you can go to a movie or, I think there's bowling. Danny throws the plate of cookies onto the ground, startling everybody including himself.
51) 34) dialog: (to the nurse's aide) Sorry. Danny!
51) 36) dialog: Sorry, Dad, I didn't think that would be so loud. 154
51) 38) dialog: I'm leaving now, Dad. I'm going to drive back to the city-(again to the aide) You'll be here, right? Yes.
51) 40) dialog: I'll clean this up, don't worry. (back to his Dad) And then I'm going to LA to see Matthew. (and to himself) "I love you." "I forgive you." "Forgive me." "Thank you." "Goodbye."
51) 45) dialog: The flight leaves at 4:30, you think we'll be OK?
51) 47) dialog: I've never flown business class. I've never done business. My brother had miles. He removes the Vuarnet sunglasses from his pocket and put them on. He gazes out the window. Loretta, in a sweater and jeans, walks briskly down the street, holding herself against the cold. 155
51) 48) dialog: (suddenly) Can you stop the car!
52) 1) dialog: Loretta's mouth widens into a big smile. Danny emerges from the town car wearing his big Vuarnet sunglasses and holding a cane.
52) 3) dialog: Just going for a ride with my chauffeur. No, I'm kidding... Um, I'm on my way out to the coast. The coast?
52) 5) dialog: (embarrassed) Los Angeles.
52) 7) dialog: Yeah, thus the town car. Matthew got it for me. I usually take the A train. (removing the glasses and indicating the car) This is not representative of where I am in my life. Loretta laughs and touches his arm affectionately.
52) 8) dialog: I'm going to stay with Matthew for a while...
52) 10) dialog: Yeah...I don't know. weather. I like
52) 12) dialog: Oh...it's this affectation, I'm trying...NO, no...new hip.
52) 14) dialog: Yeah...better. I did my best to ignore it, but the hip won out.
52) 16) dialog: He's OK. He's out of the hospital.
52) 18) dialog: Yeah...he's better...health-wise, otherwise...the same.
52) 20) dialog: Yeah. He's still waiting for his life to begin.
52) 22) dialog: (honestly) I don't know, has he? 157
52) 24) dialog: (realizes) Yeah. (suddenly) There's so much I believed without knowing I believed it. They both smile silently.
52) 26) dialog: L.J. mentioned you were seeing a screenwriter-LORETTA Oh yeah...that didn't take. You know, after my divorce, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm single now.
52) 27) dialog: (abruptly) I won't be leaving New York for good. I'll be back.
52) 29) dialog: See you in twenty years. Ha.
52) 31) dialog: No, I have to come back for Eliza's freshman film festival anyway in a month.
52) 33) dialog: Yeah, it's at Bard.
52) 35) dialog: It's, uh, not un-pornographic, I'm warning you.
52) 37) dialog: She's really talented, I think. You know, I think she's got something...
