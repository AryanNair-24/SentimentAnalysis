And it's a disturbing commentary on the culture that truly ordinary work, made mostly by his assistants, gets reverent reviews by critics who ought to know better.

22) 26) dialog: It was originally untitled, but I'm going to call it "Matthew."

22) 30) dialog: You were also very musical like Danny. 63
22) 32) dialog: He was chubby as a kid but surprisingly dexterous. No, that's true, Danny was quite gifted. I don't know why he didn't pursue it. I know he raised a child, but in this day and age, it's possible to do both.

22) 97) dialog: It's so brazen. What?
22) 99) dialog: This jerk placed his glasses on our table.
22) 101) dialog: No, he knows exactly what he's doing.

22) 104) dialog: Before she dried out, Maureen drank half my wine cellar so I haven't had any good wine in a while. But she's been sober now for six weeks.
22) 106) dialog: SheвЂ™s doing it her own way. Maureen is made uncomfortable by AA which I can understand. It's quite infantilizing giving away your control like that.
22) 108) dialog: I tell Maureen, I don't like you when you drink. You become a different person, I say. (exasperated) Do we look like we need two ketchups?
22) 110) dialog: This son of a bitch just put his ketchup on our table too. The ketchup bottle is now next to the glasses case at the end of their table.
22) 111) dialog: Before you know it, he'll be sitting in my lap. The man balls up his napkin and puts it next to the ketch and glasses case on their table.
