26) 1) dialog: You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
27) 1) dialog: Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
27) 3) dialog: Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock. They have reached a table holding a covered body.  Winter unceremoniously throws back the cover.  There lies the pale naked body of the Raincoat alien.

27) 6) dialog: No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.

During this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over -- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his face.  He leans closer, examining the palm carefully. Then he peels back the alien's upper lip. Jetson frowns anew, with concern this time.  He looks around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER. Jetson motions him over.  Jetson begins questioning him using the alien language.  Sykes and Winter nearby, remai oblivious.
27) 14) dialog: Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one. (hands Sykes a polariod of dead alien's face)
