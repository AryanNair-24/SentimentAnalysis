Framing her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a mane as she undulates to the MUSIC. Sykes watches with fascination.  The MUSIC ends and Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up.  Sykes and Jetso quickly intercept her as she heads backstage.

52) 0) text: Cassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now. She takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her facial ridges.  She shudders with pleasure.  Sykes begins to perspire.
52) 2) dialog: I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together? (coos)

60) 2) text: Fire escape!  End of the hall! Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges t get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff around a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and charges down the corridor.
92) 0) text: Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second floor.  Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top of the stairs waiting for them.

101) 0) text: She leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets them enter ahead of her.  A couple of them smile at her lasciviously as they brush past.  She is about to enter herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, coverin her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door. It is Jetson.  He had been hiding behind some crates stacked here in the corridor.  He pins Cassandra powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth. She struggles until she sees who it is.
101) 2) dialog: In there.
102) 21) text: Except you. Harcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall. Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen. Jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosse it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it. All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.
102) 25) dialog: You... you killed Strader? Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket.
102) 26) dialog: Where's Todd?!  Did you do something to Todd?! Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.

102) 35) text: Do it! Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger. There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then look up. Quint is blown backward away from her. Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the Casull smoking in his hand. Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He crashes through it.
