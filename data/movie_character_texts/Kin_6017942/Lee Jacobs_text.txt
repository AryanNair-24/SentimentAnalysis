A half-odd dozen of them or more -- All in ADVANCED, MENACING, OTHERWORLDLY ARMOR -- lying st about the space in varying configurations of carnage. Eli has somehow wandered into the aftermath of an O.K. Co scenario. Only we can’t be sure the players are from Eart HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. This was an ugly fight too. Eli turns. Half expecting sir or some adult to burst into the room and take charge... Only silence and frozen wind call back. Eli hesitates. Wa even closer... ..-- from the look of these ARMORED BODIES, there were TW DISTINCT SIDES. ONE has sleeker-looking ARMOR, the SECOND rough-etched. Utilitarian beneath bits of battered garb. Both sides WEAR MECHANIZED HELMETS. Concealing their feat Eli sloooowly approaches the closest MOTIONLESS BODY, sp out across a pile of RUBBLE -- he stares at the helmet an carefully wipes away a thin layer of frost from the visor -- and slows. At Eli’s feet: IS SOME KIND OF METALLIC DEV One of theirs. Its contours sleek and other-worldly. Eli leans down... grips it. Cautious. Lifts it to INSPECT -- -- and the gesture ACTIVATES something.

Eli’s using th TARGETING SYSTEM to take aim at different objects -- -- Eli's hand grazes the trigger a moment. Doesn't pull. Curiosity growing. Eli eyeballs THE WEAPON in his hands. What are you?
