59) 19) dialog: Well, fine, but, make an appointment.
89) 3) dialog: ...she's rail thin. She's a blond. I would not have known who she was if she hadn't come up and introduced herself to me. She looked totally different... and... (notices Brooke increasing the machine's resistance) You're going straight to level six don't you think you better pace yourself a little bit?

89) 16) dialog: You want me to guess?
89) 23) dialog: 
89) 28) dialog: Did he write the check?
89) 33) dialog: Why not?
89) 37) dialog: We don't lie to each other, Brooke.
89) 42) dialog: 
89) 47) dialog: What about your father's head- where he cut his head and the pain that he's hiding in his stomach and, now (starts to tear) For some reason that's way to complicated for me to understand, there's no money for a routine gift? Does that seem a little strange to you?
89) 51) dialog: So tell me what's happening. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 79.
89) 56) dialog: No. You have to do what's right for you. Not him, not me, not anyone. This is your life.
89) 64) dialog: 
104) 9) dialog: You spoke to Brooke?
104) 14) dialog: No. She didn't have to.
104) 18) dialog: ...you explained, did you?
104) 23) dialog: Everything? (off his silence) Lift up your shirt.
104) 27) dialog: Lift up -- your shirt.
104) 33) dialog: Did you tell her about that?
104) 38) dialog: Oh, don't treat me like an idiot. You've been sneaking off to see her for months. You don't think I know that?
104) 42) dialog: I never cared, really, about your secretaries, your- gallerists, whores, whatever you wanna call them. I cared about our home. And now you have brought this to our door.
104) 46) dialog: No you did what was necessary for you, Robert, for your interests.
104) 50) dialog: Yes.
104) 54) dialog: This isn't about your business, this is our life! Where do you think we're going tonight? Why do you think I've even tolerated this for so long?
104) 58) dialog: I'm glad you find that funny. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 98.
104) 62) dialog: I didn't ask you because I didn't want you to lie.
104) 67) dialog: But I thought that we had an understanding. And you broke that understanding when you brought Brooke into it.
104) 71) dialog: When you made Brooke complicit-- when you risked her future-- and I'm done.
104) 76) dialog: Read it.
104) 81) dialog: You're not following. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 99.
104) 85) dialog: (like talking to a child) Okay, uhm, the police have been trying to talk me. I assume they want to know where you were that night. And you know what? I'm not gonna lie for you anymore. Not unless you sign that.
104) 90) dialog: I think you'll find a way to manage. I'm sure you have all kinds of things offshore for a rainy day.
104) 95) dialog: 
104) 100) dialog: Well then... I'll have to tell them that you came home at four-thirty bruised and bleeding...
104) 105) dialog: I think we call it negotiating. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 100.
104) 109) dialog: You know what, it'll cause just enough trouble- the kind of trouble that you don't want-- In fact, according to my lawyer
104) 114) dialog: It's enough to give them probable cause and then they can subpoena your cell phone, GPS, DNA,
104) 118) dialog: And whatever else they can think of. So really Robert what you have is a choice: you can spend the next three years in court and in the tabloids or-- you can be at your business.
104) 123) dialog: Just try me.
104) 126) dialog: 
104) 131) dialog: I do, but she didn't.
104) 135) dialog: (turns and heads out) Then you're gonna need a warm coat.
