52) 15) dialog: Okay.   So what'd I miss?
54) 0) text: As Max and Julie walk through...
54) 2) dialog: Bad moods after a bad round of golf... I had blonde hair, then.
54) 4) dialog: Sex addict.     Coke addict. Redhead.
54) 6) dialog: Only for two days. It wasn't even a phase.
54) 10) dialog: Oooh. Bad loser and bad, bad blonde. Farrah, frosted kinda big bad blonde. Oooh. Max laughs.
54) 11) dialog: But that's my point. I remember my hair phases more than I remember the men. (playful, sarcastic)
54) 14) dialog: A favor?
54) 16) dialog: (rolls her eyes)
54) 19) dialog: Yeah, right.     You're in love.
54) 21) dialog: Well, I don't date cops. They never have enough money and they're always too tired to screw.
55) 0) text: Upon arrival, the door is opened to Max and Julie by Eddie Dominguez, instantly recognizeable from the heist. Eddie's pouring champagne into a glass.
55) 5) dialog: Not happy. Stuck at the Biltmore with a Scarface wannabe. She looks over at Max. Let's get outta here.
55) 6) dialog: Excuse me?   I need to use the bathroom. Julie crosses to the bathroom.
56) 0) text: Where she's silently cursing Max for getting her into this lame-ass party when she hears MUFFLED VOICES outside the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through the louvered shades.
58) 0) text: Instant horror. Julie saw Max killed and retreats to the opposite side of the bathroom in total fright.
62) 0) text: Dark. Twisting. We MOVE WITH Julie as she races through it, heart in her throat. She comes upon some old metal stairs, a sliver of light at the top, and clambers up...
63) 0) text: High atop the Biltmore, this is where the passageway leads out to. A door flies open and Julie appears. Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie sprints as best she can across the Spanish-tiled roof. Turns to see --
64) 0) text: Noah and Casper appear in the Bell Tower. Noah scans the roof, takes aim and FIRES, but he's too far away -- and Julie disappears behind a rise in the roof.
67) 0) text: Julie breaks water like a dolphin, gasping for breath. She's dazed and confused, but alive -- for the moment.
80) 0) text: This small place is a typical, party girl pit  stop. Very little furniture, but closets overflowing with  clothes. Magazines, beer bottles, unmade bed. Wet and   frightened Julie scurries around with a cordless phone at  her ear, locking all the doors and windows.
80) 1) dialog: I need to talk to Detective Lowrey!
80) 3) dialog: You can get me Detective Lowrey!
80) 5) dialog: No.     It's another murder case.
80) 7) dialog: Listen! I just saw my best friend murdered. I'm soaking wet. I'm alone, I'm scared and I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey!
82) 4) dialog: I don't want to come downtown! I don't want police protection! If you can't gimme Detective Lowrey I'm just gonna blow town!
85) 3) dialog: Who's there?
86) 1) dialog: How do I know it's Detective Lowrey?
86) 3) dialog: Yes! I wanna see it now! I'm not letting you through the fucking door until I do. Hold it up to the peephole! Burnett shows his shield.    Holds it up to the peephole.
86) 4) dialog: Anybody can get one of those.
87) 0) text: But as Burnett enters the house, all he notices are that two DOGS start YAPPING HYSTERICALLY. He can't see her. But she can see him. From behind the door, she comes out swinging a bat. Burnett ducks and Julie smashes the hat stand instead.
87) 4) dialog: You're not Mike Lowrey!
87) 6) dialog: The way Max described you was different.
87) 9) dialog: Prove it!
87) 11) dialog: Wrong. Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off.
87) 16) dialog: I saw it all... I watched him shoot her. Like she was nothing. (trying to hold it together)
87) 20) dialog: You're not what I expected.
87) 23) dialog: No.   Nobody.
87) 25) dialog: Where are we going? (as she stuffs the dog into the tote)
87) 30) dialog: (pulls away)
87) 34) dialog: Luke?!   Where's my other dog?!
88) 0) text: Julie leads him down a metal stairway.        BULLETS RIC left and right.
89) 0) text: FOLLOW Burnett and Julie as they race through the grungy alley to his station wagon --
90) 0) text: The cafe is between Julie's front door and the Volvo. Casper appears, FIRING his GUN. People scatter and scream. BULLETS RIP all about.
91) 3) dialog: All I remember is one of them had really bad hair. Where are we going?
91) 5) dialog: (cuts him off)
91) 10) dialog: Believe me, it's not a new thing. Especially when my life is at stake. I read the newspaper you know, people disappear all the time.
91) 13) dialog: I didn't really think about it. I guess it's your place or a plane ticket. Your place is cheaper. So you choose.
91) 18) dialog: Wrong?
95) 2) dialog: Nice... very nice. All this on a cop's salary?
95) 4) dialog: Right. What was your last pick? A horse in the number two race at Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you an inside tip.
95) 7) dialog: I'll ask you this only   once, Mike. Are you on the take?    And if you say no and I discover   you're lying to me, I'll walk. Are    we clear?
95) 15) dialog: Where are you going?
95) 18) dialog: You mean, you're going to leave me alone? In your place. With all your stuff?
95) 20) dialog: Of course not. And I'm not a call girl, either.
95) 22) dialog: I know you didn't. I just thought you should know.
95) 27) dialog: Just one more thing. Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett. It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.
95) 28) dialog: Thank you.   For everything.
95) 30) dialog: Aren't you going to --
95) 34) dialog: You don't have to explain. Finally, they've reached consensus.     Burnett grins and is out the door.
105) 0) text: Julie's fresh from a shower, towel about her and drying her hair.
105) 2) dialog: That you, Mike?
105) 4) dialog: At least your timing's good. Can you bring me the lotion on the nightstand? Burnett enters.    Julie has a towel wrapped around her body.
105) 7) dialog: Thanks.   So I was thinking... Julie, obviously free with her body, suddenly drops the towel and starts applying lotion. Burnett averts his eyes, turning around a full one-eighty, but finds himself facing a mirror. Oops. Looks left, another shiny surface.   Shit.
105) 10) dialog: The guy who killed Max. Now, he was looking for the heroin that Eddie stole from him... Max went to the party as a favor to you. You're a dope cop, right?
105) 12) dialog: So this isn't about Max's death at all. It's about dope.
105) 14) dialog: There's some powder in there, too. Can you hand that to me? (waits for an answer)
105) 21) dialog: Mike? I borrowed a T-shirt and some boxer shorts until we can somehow get back over to my place to pick up some clothes.
106) 0) text: Burnett exits the closet to find Julie   brushing out her wet hair, wearing nothing but what she   described, a T- shirt and pair of Lowrey's boxers tied   up with a shoe string. This ensemble never looked so    good.
106) 2) dialog: Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all the pictures? Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of Lowrey. All ego.
106) 6) dialog: Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta guys. And I've seen a good number of their bedrooms, okay? But I've never seen... I mean, look at it. It's like a shrine to him.
106) 11) dialog: Saved your life?
106) 13) dialog: Okay, but Mike. This is like a lot of pictures. I mean, this isn't something by the bedstand. This is a whole wall... And I know Max said you were just friends. That's why I was thinking, maybe... you could be... gay. Burnett reacts, then recovers with...
106) 15) dialog: I didn't mean to offend you.
107) 0) text: Burnett and Julie are sitting at the computer looking at mug shots dialed in from the police database. She fiddles with, but does not eat her salad, while stealing sideways glances from the computer screen to the nasty, bologna sandwich Burnett is eating.
107) 5) dialog: Somethin' weird. Sounded like three angels... He wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something. I didn't get the rest. (back to the mug shots)
107) 8) dialog: I don't wanna take a break. Then we'd have to talk and I got nothing to say to a cannibal.
107) 10) dialog: That was a living, breathing consciousness. It felt joy. Sadness. Maybe it even had a name.
107) 12) dialog: That flesh you're shoveling into your mouth.
107) 15) dialog: It was alive. Some farmer  fed it. Got it to trust him. Then  blew its brains out, dumped it in a cement mixer with a ton of carcinogens and now you're   eating it.
107) 19) dialog: No. At least finish it so I won't have to look at it. (back to the screen)
107) 22) dialog: Wait. Hold it. Go back... That's him! That's one of 'em.
110) 0) text: Burnett is cleaning up dog shit    from one of Lowrey's Persian rugs. The stain won't     come out. So Burnett tries a can that he's grabbed.     It foams. Julie appear with a pile of clean laundry in    hand.
110) 2) dialog: And you used Pledge to clean it up?
110) 5) dialog: Well, that makes a big difference. You just varnished that into the fabric. I'm sure it works great. Burnett doesn't quite know what    to do with the wad of dog poop in paper towels still    in his hand. Julie snatches it from him and heads    for the bathroom. Burne follows. He suddenly realizes     that the clean clothes his.
110) 9) dialog: I just threw them in with mine.
110) 12) dialog: (shyly)
110) 15) dialog: Sorry. As Burnett starts to walk away...
110) 16) dialog: Listen, Mike. I don't have any of my clothes. I wanna go back to my place to get some.
110) 18) dialog: I need apparel. That and I need some food that's something more than a cold, slab of fear.
110) 20) dialog: All you got in the place are frozen steaks.
115) 0) text: The CAMERA STARTS ON a beautiful SHOT of Julie sleeping in the bedroom, then PULLS BACK AND SWIVELS to reveal Burnett on the couch. Gun laid across his chest. He lays awake while Luke and Duke sniff at his feet.
122) 0) text: Keys in the door and Burnett and Lowrey enter the apartment. Julie's DOGS run up to them, YAPPING.
122) 2) dialog: I'll be ready in just a minute. I thought I'd have you tell -- She stalls at the sight of Lowrey, a little spark of interest passes between them.
122) 3) dialog: Hi. I'm Julie. You must be Marcus. (hand outstretched)
122) 7) dialog: He said we were going to a club tonight.
122) 11) dialog: Oh,  that's fuckin' swell! And you call  this protective custody? I'm here  all day. I'm alone and scared. And  all I got to protect me is Chet the  doorman --
122) 13) dialog: It was my babies, Luke and Duke. They get nervous in new surroundings. I offered to pay for the cleaning, but Mike wouldn't hear of it -- Lowrey spots rings from glasses on the table.
122) 15) dialog: She might be catching on here.
122) 16) dialog: Marcus, you act like it's your place.
123) 16) dialog: (to Burnett)
123) 19) dialog: I feel safer now. She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door- way and gets into his face.
125) 0) text: Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and sits back down at the computer. She plays with the keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death replaying itself in her mind. Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and exits.
129) 0) text: Julie pulls up in Lowrey's Porsche. Before the valet can get to the door, she's opening Lowrey's glove box. In it there's a pistol. Julie mulls it over before removing it and stuffing it in her purse.
137) 0) text: He's watching Ferguson and Noah moving in for the kill when Fouchet's POV SHIFTS from the dance floor TO Julie.
138) 0) text: Lowrey meets Julie halfway. He's got her by the arm and is shouting over the loud music.
138) 2) dialog: The guy who killed Max.   I remember something he said!
138) 7) text: Each moving through the crowd toward Lowrey and Julie. Guns with silencers held tight to their sides.
138) 9) dialog: Three little angels! The guy who killed Max said 'three little -- Julie sees Noah and freezes.
140) 0) text: Julie pulls the gun from her purse, shuts her eyes and starts FIRING wildly.
142) 0) text: The room clears around Julie. Noah is back on his feet, once again with the gun. But...
142) 4) text: Julie?
142) 6) dialog: as she grabs Lowrey.
142) 7) dialog: That's him!
149) 1) dialog: Just getting out of the car as the station blows.    They shield themselves against the explosion.
149) 3) dialog: That's it. That's it.   You're both crazy. Julie takes a few steps away before she decides to give them the other barrel.
149) 4) dialog: Protect and serve. Sound familiar? Isn't that what you're supposed to do? 'Cuz I'd like to know whose butt you're protecting.
149) 8) dialog: All you care about is getting your dope back. No, that's not all, you care about getting it back in a way that shows how fucking macho and tough you are. It's all some big testosterone contest. Well, fuck that. As Julie walks in one direction, Burnett blows off in the other.
149) 12) dialog: That's what I'm afraid of. Once again, Julie pulls away. But Lowrey's got her tight... and close. He digs deep.
149) 14) text: I need you. Magic words.   Julie's swayed, despite herself.
149) 17) dialog: Do they teach charm at the academy?
150) 0) text: Police units surround  -- flashing lights. Julie is shaken, waiting in the  back of a police unit. Meanwhile, Ruiz and Sanchez join  Burnett and Lowrey at the trunk of the toasted car. The   fire crew crowbars open the lid. The trunk gives way to  a ghastly, toxic smell. Everyone gags.
153) 0) text: Burnett crawls into the bed, fully clothed. This is awkward. Julie calls out from the bathroom.
153) 1) dialog: I'm really sorry about the dog pee. They must be traumatized by the new surroundings. I'll pay for new cushions.
153) 5) dialog: So, Mike.   Can I ask you something?
153) 7) dialog: Do you always come to bed with your clothes on? Or just when there's a woman in it?
153) 9) dialog: Really. You think Marcus would wear clothes to bed while on protective duty?
153) 11) dialog: Oh, I definitely have a cop thing, too.
153) 13) dialog: Well Marcus. He's very   something ... sexy. And the way I   came in tonight, he was throwing  everybody this way and that and he  took control.
153) 15) dialog: I know.   You drove well.
153) 19) dialog: That's right, you did. And it was exciting... But Marcus... (bites her lip)
153) 22) dialog: I'll bet Theresa is takin' care of business right now.
153) 24) dialog: You know, relieve his tension. A woman'll do anything to keep a man like that. You know what I mean? Tonight... made me a little bit horny, I guess. I think, maybe. It was the car chase. Or the guns and everything. I've never shot a gun before. Maybe it's the steel or something. I'm feeling a little... funny.
153) 26) dialog: I don't know.    Do you feel a little funny?
153) 28) dialog: Not that kind of funny.
153) 30) dialog: You know... (rubs him)

156) 1) dialog: Usually the guy throws me out after he fucks me.
158) 0) text: GRINDING GEARS, Burnett stops around the corner from his house. He turns OFF the IGNITION and turns to Julie.
158) 2) dialog: You prick! First you don't want me. Then you drag me out...
158) 6) dialog: (then she gets it)
176) 0) text: It pulls out and drives right past the sedan.    Julie in full, animated view.
181) 0) text: Burnett enters with Julie in tow. He looks defeated, grass stains on his clothes, mussed hair. And here comes Chet.
183) 0) text: Julie's handcuffed to the steering wheel again, semi- draped in the front seat. She can't believe it.
183) 1) dialog: I'm getting really tired of this shit!
187) 0) text: Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey. Each is clearly tired of the other. The silence is deadly until Julie breaks the silence.
187) 1) dialog: So where's the coffee and donuts?
187) 3) dialog: I thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout. A little caffeine for the heart. Some sugar-coated dough fried in day old grease.
187) 5) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All     these hours on the case, you must    miss Theresa's home cooking. (near Lowrey's ear)
187) 8) dialog: I imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed --
187) 32) dialog: Guess we know the answer to that one. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94
191) 0) text: Coral Gables stakeout. Julie's passed out and, once again, sleeping in the rear of the car. In the glow of the faltering streetlights and the approaching dawn, she couldn't look more beautiful. And from his post in the driver's seat, he's looking at her with a longing that goes well beyond lust. Then Burnett breaks the silence.
195) 3) dialog: Wha...? Lowrey has the keys in the ignition and is stomping on the gas.
200) 2) dialog: So what am I gonna do?
200) 4) dialog: What?
201) 0) text: Typical pandemonium. Theresa is making/serving breakfast while the TV BLARES. Quincy is channel surfing on the TV when he comes up with the news footage of the explosion, followed by more footage of Lowrey, Julie, and Burnett at the scene.
201) 6) dialog: Where you going?
204) 0) text: Julie is framed in the bedroom doorway, somewhat sadly watching Burnett and Lowrey scramble to get ready for the bust.
204) 1) dialog: So, I guess when you get back, it's gonna be over.
204) 4) text: Hey, Julie. Do me a favor and see who that is. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94                                98
205) 0) text: Julie looks through the peephole, then opens the door. And there's Theresa. Julie's hip.

208) 0) text: Julie's inside. She hits the close door button.    But Lowrey's there to catch it.
208) 2) dialog: You think I didn't know? God, you are so stupid! And to think I let you use me like you did, Max. Why?
208) 4) dialog: Wait. I know why. Because you said you needed me. Jesus, who's the stupid one now?
208) 6) dialog: Fuck you! Julie slams a fist into Lowrey's face. The elevator doors shut. Then Burnett comes hauling down the corridor with Theresa at his heels. He pounds the elevator button.
209) 0) text: The elevator doors open and Julie makes for exit. She sees a cab parked outside, slips back on her spiked heel and starts to run for it when --
209) 13) dialog: On floor.    In the middle.   Crawling for cover when --
211) 0) text: Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car. All three bad guys pile in and the CAR PEELS RUBBER just as Lowrey makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear, he appears from the building, turns the corner out the door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.
215) 0) text: Turns the corner, running up over car roofs and hoods. He lowers his gun and tries to draw a bead on Fouchet and the gang. They've got Julie and now they're running.
219) 0) text: Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before. He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.
237) 0) text: Ferguson is seated and staring across at Julie. Across his lap is a shotgun. She may be bruised and abused. But she's still got some bite.
237) 4) dialog: I forget the formula. Big gun, big dick? No. Little gun, big dick? No. Big gun, little dick? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it.
264) 2) dialog: Michael! Her VOICE ECHOES.
265) 0) text: He's handcuffed himself to Julie, dragging her deeper and deeper into the hangar. The smoke is getting thicker and swirling with the burning cash.

269) 7) dialog: He threw it in the --

273) 6) dialog: You got a real way with kids, Lowrey.
