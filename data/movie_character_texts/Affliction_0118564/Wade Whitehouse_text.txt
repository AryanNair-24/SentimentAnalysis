4) 17) dialog: Well, I guess I am. I planned this,  I planned all this, you know. I mean,  it's sort of pathetic, but I planned  it. You shouldn't have called your  mother. (takes her arm) C'mon, we're gonna call her before  she leaves.
5) 0) text: Wade leads her to a frosted-glass door reading "POLICE",  enters. Inside, he flips on flourescent light, dials the  desk phone. More utility room than office. He waits. There's no answer. Jill looks down.

5) 3) dialog: That's all you got to say? "Yes".
5) 5) dialog: She won't be here for a half hour.  Think you can stand it that long?

8) 1) dialog: Lillian!
8) 3) text: LILLIAN, 40, attractive in an ankle-length hooded coat.  Whatever pose Wade strikes, she strikes the opposite. Her dress and demeanor set her apart.
8) 4) dialog: Me and Jill, we just had a little  spat. She felt kind of left out, I  guess, from not knowing some of the  new kids --
8) 7) dialog: She told me she wanted to wait for  you. Inside.

Straight as a statue, Wade holds back traffic. Cars and t are backed up on the unplowed road. Horns honk and bleat; woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day!" Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. Obli or just plum contrary. A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic o the shoulder. A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in fron two children in back. Whitehouse waves for it to stop. The BMW accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wa and the traffic. It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is  quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust. Wade slips one knee. Honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes. Wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls in. LUGENE BROOKS, 60, school principal, rushes over:

21) 5) text: Wade and Jimmy head out.
22) 0) text: Wade, shivering in the open grader, plows a narrow windin road. He lights a cigarette, exhales steamy smoke. LaCoy' laugh triggers a memory:
