101) 4) text: Y-yes. OFFICER TURLINGTON
101) 6) text: Yes -- I -- I just pulled over.     I was -- looking for a bathroom. Morning sickness, you know... OFFICER TURLINGTON
101) 12) dialog: Holy shit. (clicks the safety off)
101) 14) dialog: Hands up where I can see them. Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.
101) 15) dialog: Nice and slow, start talking to me. And make it good. Tell me just exactly who that is. A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock. Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive. But just barely.
104) 10) text: Notice, Counselor, how I'm not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer. Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to Turlington.
118) 2) dialog: We're here on Miranda Grey detail. The Guards shake their heads, chuckle.
118) 4) dialog: Thanks, guys. The Guard points at the bank of monitors.
118) 7) dialog: Looks perfectly harmless, doesn't she?
122) 6) dialog: Officer Turlington, ma'am. We're supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey's cell all night.
128) 0) text: Officer Turlington runs down the corridor, searching frantically with his flashlight --
130) 0) text: Officer Turlington looks inside Miranda's cell. Empty. And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her: Seated by the elevator. Holding a biting block in Shelley's mouth as her seizing subsides.
130) 3) dialog: Sorry, we thought you might have made a run for it.
131) 11) dialog: One of your patients is holding the Sheriff at gunpoint. She's in the cafeteria. Pete glances at Miranda.      She knows exactly who it is
133) 0) text: Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser. He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her --
133) 5) dialog: Sir, not now --
133) 7) dialog: Sir, please --
137) 0) text: WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol car and drive off. WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station...
147) 0) text: Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues.
148) 0) text: Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it.
148) 1) dialog: Sheriff Ryan? No sight of the man.  That's odd. Maybe he's in the bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction.
149) 0) text: Turlington peeks in.      checks the stalls.
149) 1) dialog: Sheriff? Nobody. He notices the back window is open because raindrops are blown in by the wind. He looks out to the parking lot for a moment before shutting it.
150) 2) text: Is the Sheriff here or isn't he? OFFICER TURLINGTON (reaching the scene)
150) 4) text: We're here to see Miranda Grey. OFFICER TURLINGTON
150) 7) text: Better get the Sheriff out here. Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused. OFFICER TURLINGTON
150) 9) text: Officer, unlock the goddamn door to Miranda's cell or I'll break it down myself. Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way, certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open. The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.
151) 4) dialog: Jesus H. Christ. Teddy Howard has to look away. Pete places his hand on Parsons' shoulder. Parsons simply glares at the dead man, eyes filled with hatred. No sign of Miranda anywhere.        Vanished.   Like Houd
