3) 10) dialog: (Whispers) Every week --
3) 13) dialog: Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by  his intransigence. If I didn't know  better, I'd swear Massey had some  personal investment in my ruination.
3) 15) dialog: Well, if he continues to maintain  this position -- we're in court.
3) 17) dialog: Get this! He called and invited me  to dinner.

3) 70) dialog: You just haven't met the right person.
3) 73) dialog: All right, Miles. Let me tell you  everything you THINK you know. I was  married to Rex for a long time. I  was an excellent wife, a partner, a  lover, a hostess and a friend. There  was only one thing I did wrong during  the five years we were together. I  got five years older. Think he should  be able to ditch me for that?
3) 75) dialog: See the tape. Then we can discuss  reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I  nailed his ass. Now I'm going to  have it mounted and have my  girlfriends over to throw darts at  it. Then I'm getting on with my life.  That's all I'm after.
3) 77) dialog: What is it you're after, Miles?

And he's in court, and he looks into  the spectators gallery, and sees his  Brother. They brought the brother  from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a  word. He can't testify. That's what  it was like seeing Pat in there. I  couldn't even have Ruth cross examine  her.
4) 3) dialog: (Shrugs) Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA.  Maybe they offered her money. Massey  is very seductive. Who knows.
4) 6) dialog: They bought her speech. If I was  only in it for Rex's money, he  shouldn't have to give me any.
4) 9) dialog: Nothing specific, but I'll have my  own place soon.
4) 11) dialog: Probably. Every woman in my life was  divorced at least twice. What was I  supposed to say. Anthropologist?

9) 41) dialog: Howard and I are here, Miles, because  I have learned through bitter  experience that when it comes to  matrimonial law, you are the very  best.
9) 43) dialog: As you are well aware, my previous  marriage ended with an unjustified  strain on my reputation My motives  were questioned. I was slandered in  court.

Write a book about table linen?  Because that's what wives do when  they get dumped, and frankly, I'm  not quite ready for that.

15) 9) dialog: (Reproachfully) You really think I engineered the  whole thing. You think the marriage  and the divorce was part of some  scheme. You came here to celebrate  because you think I'm without morality  or soul. You -- (With difficulty) sound like my mother.
15) 12) dialog: Yes, I -- well, I'm not really...

18) 1) dialog: I just cried when I got home. Somehow,  your disdain for me -- I'm pretty  tough Miles, but I'm human. All my  life people have been ascribing these  terrible motives to me. I used to  think they were jealous, or they  didn't understand, but... I dunno.  Maybe others see something in me.  Something I'm not even aware of.  Anyway, thank you for letting me  come here. I guess I was a little  drunk.

18) 16) dialog: You look like you were a very  sensitive child. You have expressive  eyes.
18) 19) dialog: And your mother was very beautiful.  She must be proud of you.
18) 21) dialog: She didn't love you?
18) 23) dialog: She held that against you?
18) 25) dialog: Boy. Boy, oh boy.
18) 26) text: Marylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can se how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of some genuine crosses her face.
18) 27) dialog: And here I thought my mother was...
18) 29) dialog: Oh right. You met Patricia.
18) 31) dialog: We're damaged goods.
18) 33) dialog: We are, Miles. You know I'm right.  There's something "off" about you  and me Miles. And maybe it isn't  because of these women -- maybe they  were just extremely insightful and  recognized our "deficiencies" very  early on. Maybe...
18) 35) dialog: I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen  to me. I'm sure you have a very  fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm  depressing.
