1) 0) text: Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm.
1) 1) dialog: The problem is that everyone is  willing to compromise. That's the  problem with the institution of  marriage -- it's based on compromise.  Even through its dissolution. One  attorney will try to score some  points, the opposition will try to  impeach. The process will find an  equilibrium point determined by the  skill of the opposing lawyers, and  then each party will walk away with  their portion of the "goodies." Some  say, "Life is compromise." But at  Massey Myerson we believe life is  struggle and the ultimate destruction  of your opponent.
1) 4) dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will  continue this at the Associates  Meeting next Friday. In the meantime,  I want you to consider this... Ivan  the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila  the Hun -- what did they have in  common?
1) 8) dialog: Mr. Rexroth.
1) 10) dialog: Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and  consider this office your office,  your haven, your war room -- for the  duration of the campaign.
1) 12) dialog: Now Rex.

1) 17) text: Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return.
1) 19) dialog: That's her job. You have to respect  that.
1) 21) dialog: Mm.
1) 24) dialog: Time marches on. Ardor cools.
1) 26) dialog: Ah.
1) 28) dialog: Gotcha. No need to get anatomically  correct with me, Rex.
1) 30) dialog: Well, with the expanding global  population -- Let me ask you this --  your wife. Has she pursued the  opportunities which must present  themselves to the "knock-out, sexy  woman" you described?
1) 32) dialog: Not in court you can't. Has she  retained counsel?
1) 34) dialog: And your wife is aware of or has  evidence of your activities?
1) 36) dialog: Mmm... And to cut to the chase,  forensically speaking -- is there a  pre-nup?
1) 37) text: Rex hangs his head. Miles sighs sympathetically.
1) 38) dialog: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars, but in ourselves. Well,  let me ask you this: what kind of  settlement do you seek? What are,  for you, the parameters of the  possible?
1) 40) dialog: Nothing?
1) 42) dialog: So, you propose that in spite of  demonstrable infidelity on your part,  your unoffending wife should be tossed  out on her ear?
1) 44) text: Miles smiles at him.
2) 44) dialog: Nothing.
2) 46) dialog: Video.
2) 48) text: Miles turns to Wrigley with a look of indignation. He ges to their surroundings.
2) 49) dialog: Wrigley!
2) 51) dialog: Sometimes I have serious doubts about  you.
2) 53) dialog: Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
2) 55) dialog: I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer  clerked for Scalia.
2) 59) dialog: Anyway, I need a challenge. This --
2) 61) dialog: -- is not a challenge. I need  something I can sink my teeth into,  professionally speaking.
2) 64) dialog: I'm sorry, your honor, I was just  conferring with my associate...
2) 66) dialog: Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know  a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?
2) 68) dialog: (sadly) Accountant.
2) 70) dialog: We would like to offer these  photographs into evidence...
2) 74) dialog: ...Ruth!
2) 76) dialog: -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth.  And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
2) 83) text: Miles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and  smiles shyly. He snaps out of it.
2) 84) dialog: So, Ruth. How's Sam?
2) 86) dialog: A yert. (To Rex) Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a  time when most women are in Boca,  having early bird specials -- she's  working so her husband can be in  Montana. In a yert.
2) 89) dialog: What?!
2) 91) text: A tight, terse smile from Miles.
2) 92) dialog: How nice.
2) 97) dialog: At this point my client is still  prepared to consider reconciliation.
2) 99) dialog: My client is prepared to entertain  an amicable dissolution of the  marriage without prejudice.
2) 101) dialog: My client proposes a thirty day  cooling off period.
2) 103) dialog: My client asks that you not initiate  proceedings pending his setting  certain affairs in order.
2) 105) dialog: (conceding the point) Heh heh.
2) 107) text: Miles lays a hand on his arm.
2) 108) dialog: Please -- let me handle this.
2) 110) dialog: -- So much for the icebreakers.  What're you after, Ruth?
2) 112) dialog: Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why  not ask for a hundred percent?
2) 114) dialog: Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
2) 121) dialog: Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
2) 125) text: She looks at him like a concerned parent. Miles and Ruth  watch the interaction.
2) 128) dialog: Are you familiar with Kirshner?
2) 131) dialog: Please -- let me handle this. Okay,  Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your  bottom line?
2) 134) dialog: Shhh. Please. Let me do my job. (To Ruth) Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten  about Kirshner?
2) 137) text: Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back.
2) 138) dialog: Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.
2) 140) dialog: I think that went as well as could  be expected.
2) 142) dialog: And she had private investigators  assisting her.
2) 144) dialog: In anticipation of making you sick.
2) 146) text: Miles looks at him. Shakes his head, sadly.
2) 147) dialog: A superficial display of marital  solicitude, and you lose your resolve?  Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm  your attorney, and if you choose to  reward her for that mediocre charade  of spousal concern...
3) 30) dialog: Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming.
3) 34) text: Miles glances at the wine list.
3) 35) dialog: French? (She smiles) Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57.

3) 39) text: Miles regards her.
3) 40) dialog: Your husband told me you were  beautiful, but I was unprepared.
3) 42) text: Miles leans back, props his chin on one fist, and conside her.
3) 43) dialog: Simon &amp; Garfunkel?
3) 45) dialog: Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
3) 47) dialog: Not yet.
3) 49) text: A waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sip and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses.
3) 51) dialog: What does your lawyer think?
3) 53) dialog: But you don't agree?
3) 55) dialog: Why would you be here?
3) 57) text: FLAP a menu enters frame. It is handed to Marylin; anothe is handed to Miles.
3) 58) dialog: I'll have the tournedos of beef. And  the lady will have the same? (To Marylin) I assume you're a carnivore.
3) 62) text: Miles looks at her with appreciation.
3) 63) dialog: "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at  first sight?"
3) 65) dialog: Not really. You're not my client.  Freedom of association. Big issue  with the First Amendment fans. Want  to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
3) 67) dialog: No.
3) 69) dialog: As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
3) 71) dialog: No. I haven't. Have you?
3) 74) dialog: He wants a reconciliation.
3) 76) dialog: Gotcha.
3) 78) dialog: Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking  for an ass to mount.
3) 89) text: Miles glances over and hisses:
3) 90) dialog: Shut! Up!
3) 99) text: Miles soberly rises.
3) 100) dialog: Mmmm --
3) 101) text: He paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be  lost in thought. Marylin watches him. Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims:
3) 102) dialog: "Dismiss your vows, your feigned  tears, your flattery, for where a  heart is hard, they make no  battery..."
3) 103) text: Marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of sta irritation. Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with faint smile.
3) 104) dialog: Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?
3) 109) dialog: Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how  high is that wall around your heart?
3) 114) dialog: Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you  ever been in love?
3) 117) dialog: And you've always loved him?
3) 118) text: Smiles slips out:
3) 120) text: Miles returns a fleeting smile.
3) 121) dialog: And you hoped to spend the rest of  your life with him?
3) 125) text: Miles almost smiles. She's good.
3) 126) dialog: That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please  forgive me for causing you additional  anguish. (To the Judge) Thank you, Your Honor. No further  questions.

3) 136) text: An attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be swo She was a beauty, but her glory days are past and she's n taking it well. She looks tense and slightly hypo-manic. speaks in a breathy, giggly voice, and smiles frequently no apparent reason.
3) 141) dialog: Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your  relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
3) 145) dialog: And how would you define your  relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You  know -- you are her...?
3) 149) dialog: Her Mother?
3) 150) text: Patricia smiles coyly. Gives Marylin a silly little wave way of greeting.
3) 152) dialog: Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you  are frequently mistaken for sisters.
3) 154) dialog: Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
3) 156) dialog: You were never invited to meet your  son-in-law?
3) 160) dialog: Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
3) 164) dialog: Who's "Patty."
3) 166) dialog: I see. And what were you going to  tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

5) 13) dialog: It was a gift from a client.

5) 22) dialog: I should be in therapy.
6) 0) text: Miles addresses BONNIE DONOVAN, a client.
6) 1) dialog: Yes. Your husband did show remarkable  foresight in taking those pictures.  And, yes, absent a swimming pool,  the presence of the pool man would  appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie,  who is the real victim here? Let me  suggest the following. Your husband,  who on a prior occasion slapped you --  beat you --
6) 3) dialog: Your husband, who has beaten you --  repeatedly --
6) 5) dialog: Please -- was at the time brandishing  your firearm, trying in his rage to  shoot an acquaintance -- friend of  long standing --
6) 7) dialog: So he says now! But if not for your  cool headed intervention, his tantrum  might have ended this schmoe's life  and ruined his own... As for the  sexual indiscretion which he imagined  had taken place, wasn't it in fact  he who had been sleeping with the  pool man?
6) 9) dialog: Am I going to far here?
6) 12) text: Miles is surprised.

9) 40) text: Miles flashes Marylin a "you are KIDDING" look, but she  assiduously avoids eye contact.
9) 42) text: Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.
9) 50) dialog: Oh, for the love of...
9) 52) dialog: That is correct. Not to blow my own  horn, but they devote an entire  semester to it at Harvard Law.
9) 54) dialog: I just want to make sure that you  both --
9) 56) dialog: -- understand what you're asking for  here. The Massey pre-nup provides  that in the event of a dissolution  of the marriage for any reason, both  parties shall leave it with whatever  they brought in, and earned during.  No one can profit from the marriage.  The pre-nup protects the wealthier  party.
9) 58) dialog: And without it, that party is exposed --  a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
9) 60) dialog: (slightly sickened) -- and we are sure...
9) 62) dialog: -- we are both sure that's what we  want?
9) 67) dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could  just borrow your charming fiancee  for a moment.
9) 69) dialog: I'd just like to have a word with  her.
9) 71) text: Miles drags her to the side as Doyle checks his Sports Pa
9) 72) dialog: What are you doing?
9) 75) dialog: To him? He's a sick freak.
9) 77) dialog: Passionate! He's a pervert. He should  have to register when he moves.
9) 79) dialog: Marylin! Listen to me.
9) 81) dialog: But why him?
9) 84) dialog: The Massey pre-nup has never been  pene -- successfully challenged.
9) 86) dialog: No, that's not all.
9) 88) dialog: You fascinate me.
9) 89) text: She deftly slides out of the way. Miles watches her as sh heads down the hall. As she gets on the elevator, Howard  grabs her butt with one hand, while giving Miles a high s with the other.
10) 0) text: Miles stares at the chessboard.
10) 1) dialog: Do you think I'm going to end up  like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy  bag instead of a family?
10) 3) dialog: Yes. The inability to experience  pleasure.
10) 5) dialog: What?
10) 7) dialog: She can't really love that idiot,  can she?

11) 18) dialog: Argh.
11) 19) text: Heads turn. Miles bites a knuckle. Birds twitter.
11) 24) dialog: What are they?
11) 26) dialog: Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm  surprised at you. What is this? Some  Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are  the most cockamamie things I've ever --
11) 28) text: Miles sounds wistful:
11) 29) dialog: Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?
11) 42) text: The crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a  smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild cheers. Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his ha together, nodding comprehension.
11) 43) dialog: Brilliant.
11) 46) text: Miles' hand-clapping accelerates.
11) 47) dialog: Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating  the pre-nup.
11) 54) dialog: I'd like to offer my congratulations.  That was a beautiful gesture of  Howard's.
11) 56) dialog: Yes. He's a diamond in the rough.  And I have a feeling that someday  soon you'll be taking that diamond  and leaving the rough.
11) 58) dialog: I am thrilled for you, but tell me  this... How'd you get Howard to do  it? I've addressed enough juries to  appreciate the power of suggestion,  but it seemed like he thought it was  his own idea.
11) 60) dialog: Well, when this goes south -- promise  you'll have dinner with me?
11) 62) dialog: I figure a couple of months. That's  how long it should take for the ink  on the settlement to dry.
11) 65) dialog: Although knowing you as I do -- there  will be no settlement. This time it  will be complete and total  annihilation.
14) 1) dialog: And of course we shall have to  litigate. Sentence. Paragraph.
14) 3) dialog: -- Naturally the first concern for  both parties is the welfare of little  Wendell junior. Nevertheless, we  question whether the continuing  expenses for his special ed classes  are truly justified given the great  strides --
14) 6) dialog: (Delighted) HA!
14) 8) dialog: Ah, but is she richer than Mrs.  Croesus?
14) 10) dialog: She deserves every penny. They pay  great athletes a fortune. Well,  Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the  peak of her power.
14) 12) dialog: Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
14) 14) dialog: She owes me a meal.
14) 16) dialog: I know you would, Wrigley. But would  Kramer?
15) 0) text: We move in on one of the tables where Marylin and Miles s as a waiter pours them champagne.
15) 2) dialog: Thank you. I'll take care of it.
15) 4) dialog: To victory.
15) 6) dialog: More pictures? My God, Marylin. You  can open an erotic art gallery.
15) 8) dialog: No. Just to comfort you, and  appreciate you --
15) 10) text: The Waiter hands Miles a menu.
15) 13) dialog: Not hungry, huh? Neither am I.

17) 26) dialog: You shouldn't be driving. Where are  you?
17) 28) dialog: I live right near there. The 800  Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin --  come here right now before -- just  come here.
17) 30) dialog: No. Don't stop.
18) 4) dialog: Thank you.
18) 6) dialog: Yes. I just got that, actually. It  was a gift.
18) 8) dialog: No. No. I don't have a... no. It was  from a client.

18) 17) text: Miles walks over to look at the picture.
18) 18) dialog: Hmmm...
18) 20) dialog: She never particularly cared for me.
18) 22) dialog: No. She loved me. She would never  not love her son. She just didn't...  I wasn't her "type." She said I was  a very, colicky baby. You know?  Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't  eat well? We got off to a bad start,  and she never seemed to recoup --
18) 24) dialog: Apparently she was very disappointed.
18) 26) text: Marylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can se how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of some genuine crosses her face.
18) 28) dialog: Your mother was.
18) 30) text: She takes a sip of coffee. Regards Miles.
18) 32) dialog: No, we're not!
18) 34) dialog: That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch  and yours is a psycho. I can't believe  you're saying this, Marylin! There's  nothing wrong with us. We're  attractive and charismatic and  successful and... I like us.
18) 36) dialog: No.
18) 40) dialog: Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
19) 2) dialog: I have to say -- I'm speechless. No.  I'm never speechless.

19) 10) dialog: No... That wasn't right. I want YOU  to be MY wife.
19) 12) dialog: Yes. I am. What else could those  words mean? I believe we belong  together and we can make one another  happy. And we should be happy because  happiness is better than the  alternative which is -- just jump in  any old time, Marylin. You have more  experience at this than I do.
19) 14) dialog: Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
19) 16) dialog: You do?

23) 1) dialog: For the first time in my life, I  stand before you naked...  vulnerable... and in love. Love. A  word matrimonial lawyers shy away  from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have  been frightened of this emotion which  is, in a sense, the seed of my  livelihood. But today, I am here to  tell you: Love should cause us no  fear. Love should cause us no shame.  Love... is good. (He lets it sink in) Let me ask you a question. When our  clients come to us confused, angry,  hurting because their flame of love  is fluttering and threatens to die --  should we seek to extinguish that  flame, so that we can sift through  the smoldering wreckage for our paltry  reward? Or should we seek to fan  this precious flame -- this most  precious flame -- back to loving,  roaring life?

24) 9) dialog: Here's my card. Spend as much as you  want. We get mileage.
24) 11) dialog: Good. (Beat) Are those foods?
24) 13) dialog: Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not  right away -- There's a room right  off the bedroom -- It would be perfect  for a nursery. (He takes her hands) It's a walk in humidor right now --  but if I took out the refrigeration  unit --
24) 15) dialog: I think a nursery should be right  off the master suite. My parents put  mine in the guest house. Apparently  they did have a Fisher Price intercom,  but my mother turned it off when I  was seven months old because I was  so --
