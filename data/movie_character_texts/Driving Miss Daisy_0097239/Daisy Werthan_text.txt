The whole place gives off scent of well-being and not too much religious warmth. . We are approaching the end of the Saturday morning servic The RABBI, who prefers to call himself DR. WEIL, is condu the service in a morning coat. There are no yarmulkes or other Jewish paraphernalia in sight. The sanctuary is sparsely populated this (and every) Satu morning.
