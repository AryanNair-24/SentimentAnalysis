Everyone sings (silent) "Happy Birthday"... CHILDREN follow the cake, in dresses and suits, gathering round NICHOLAS VAN ORTON, 7, guest of honor, who wears a  blindfold.  MOTHER comes to remove the blindfold and Nich ogles the cake, laughs.  He reaches for a sparkler. STEP PRINT: Mother intercepts, fussing, fixing his hair.. Nicholas' FATHER sits near, smoking, nodding.  He's inten thin, wearing a party hat.  He notices the camera without mugging for it, bends to snuff his cigarette in an ashtra SPLICE-JUMP TO/STEP PRINT: a Harlequin CLOWN ties balloon animals.  Nicholas assists, distracted by the inattentive children who look into the camera and pull hair and stand their chairs... Men are drinking, storytelling, laughing.  A fraternity.. The women are elsewhere, doing movie-vamp poses for the  camera, blowing cigarette smoke, brightly dressed, eyelid blue and green, lipstick perfect... Servants clear the table.  Father holds a piece of untouc cake.  A man talks to him, but Father stares off, lost in thought.  He's forgotten the party hat on his head... STEP PRINT: Mother puts her arms around Father and makes face the camera.  He leans in, posing dutifully. SPLICE-JUMP TO: a nanny in uniform, ILSA, holds an INFANT (CONRAD) to the camera, places the baby in Nicholas' arms STEP PRINT: Nicholas is gentle, overwhelmed by cradling h tiny brother. SPLICE-JUMP TO: children play tag.  Across the lawn, Fath heads to the house.  He looks back, walks backwards. STEP PRINT: he gives a small wave, continuing away... Kids chase past.  Nicholas and two other kids huddle, arm locked, spinning round and round, till they stumble diffe directions, falling, laughing, dizzy...

9) 32) dialog: Yeah.
9) 34) dialog: No.
9) 36) dialog: I don't need anything from you.  I  was laying on a beach somewhere in  Spain, naked, and, it hit me --  Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am,  four layovers, twenty-seven hours  flying and one donkey ride later.   Not necessarily in that order. Conrad drops an envelope on the table.

9) 75) dialog: It doesn't matter...

26) 2) text: This is Conrad.  Leave a message.
71) 8) text: That you've involved Conrad... is  unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
81) 12) dialog: Meet me out front! Conrad ducks away, moving on.
82) 5) dialog: Just drive, man. (slumps low)
82) 8) dialog: Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait... Conrad flips the sunshade, looks behind it, feels the fab of the roof and the seam of the door. He grips the interior LIGHT, breaks it open, pulling the  bulb and wires.
82) 10) dialog: They're methodical.  They're nothing  if they're not that.
82) 12) dialog: C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H.,  thank your lucky charms.  To think  what I almost got you into.
82) 15) dialog: You dodged a bullet.
82) 17) dialog: They fuck you and they fuck you and  they fuck you.  And then, just when  you think it's done, that's when the  real fucking begins.
82) 19) dialog: It doesn't stop, Nick.
82) 23) dialog: I paid the bill, I gave 'em their  money, but it all started again.   They won't leave me alone...
82) 25) dialog: Everything.  I'm a goddamn human- pinata...
82) 27) dialog: You think I know?  I paid them more  to make it stop. BOOM! -- the wheel jerks in Nicholas' hand, TIRES SCREAM.
82) 28) dialog: What the hell... !?
82) 31) dialog: It's them.  They did this.
82) 33) dialog: How do you know?

82) 39) dialog: Really?
82) 41) dialog: No.  Do you? (off Nicholas' frown)
82) 45) dialog: You're part of it...
82) 47) dialog: No!  You're one of them.  Of course,  it makes perfect sense!
82) 49) dialog: You're behind this, aren't you?  You  and your sick friends.  Well, make  it stop!
82) 53) dialog: Because you hate me.  Because you  had to be here, when mom died.   Because you had to do it alone. (near tears)
82) 56) dialog: I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How  many more times do I have to say I'm  sorry before you forgive me... ?
148) 72) text: Someone call an ambulance! Conrad's eyes are closed.  He's motionless.  He's dead. Christine lets out a hysterical sob, hands to her mouth.
148) 79) text: Why?!  I told you... I told you.   Why didn't you listen? Feingold releases Conrad to the floor, rising, bloody...
149) 6) dialog: Happy Birthday, Nickie.  Happy fucking  Birthday...
149) 10) dialog: Ladies and gentlemen... (pause)
149) 16) dialog: Count on it. Ilsa reaches to straighten Conrad's hair.  She regards  Nicholas with affection, kisses his cheek.
149) 20) dialog: In a hotel.  Ordering room service  and watching pay-per-view.  She was  a real sport. BUSINESSMAN 1 and HEAVY MAN come thru the crowd to Nichol
149) 25) dialog: Baby, they were all over the house  with metal detectors.  They switched  your gun with a look-alike, rigged  barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop- gun.
149) 27) text: Mister Van Orton... ? Nicholas and Conrad both turn to face a C.R.S. ACCOUNTANT nebbish who holds a CLIPBOARD and gives an amused look.
149) 31) dialog: Yeah... ? Conrad steps aside with the accountant.  Nicholas takes a swig off his champagne, nods in response to C.R.S. WORKER who slap his back as the pass. Nicholas realizes something, begins searching the crowd a Elizabeth arrives with HUSBAND and DAUGHTER hand in hand.
