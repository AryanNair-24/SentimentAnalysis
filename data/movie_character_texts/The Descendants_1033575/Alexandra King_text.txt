40) 8) dialog: What's up, Dad?
40) 14) dialog: (to Matt) What's happening? Why are you here?
40) 16) text: Alexandra hears this, takes a few strides, flings her gol club into the night.
40) 17) dialog: Fuck Mom!
44) 10) dialog: I'm pretty sure it's after eleven.
44) 17) dialog: I have gotten my act together. I was just drinking. I've been doing really well, but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better, and how I was in that stupid play you guys didn't bother to see. Do you even remember the name of it?
44) 21) dialog: That's what I thought. So what if I got drunk on the ONE night you happened to drop in? So the fuck what?
44) 26) dialog: How long do I have to stay?
44) 28) dialog: (getting up)
44) 31) dialog: Good times.

45) 12) dialog: A really good friend from Punahou.         We were in school together for years.
45) 14) dialog: He wants to be there for me with all this shit happening.
45) 17) dialog: No.   He might stay over too.         Is that cool?
45) 19) dialog: What the fuck? Get out of my underwear, you freak.
45) 29) text: That's part of why I brought you here. You have to help me. I don't know what to do with her. Alexandra slides into the water, swims to the other side props herself on the edge, floating her lower body. Matt lowers himself into the water too. ALEXANDRA
45) 32) dialog: Obviously. MATT
45) 40) dialog: Why'd you have to tell me in the goddamned pool? Matt climbs out and approaches her, arms extended.
45) 42) dialog: What do you want? Matt drops his arms, crestfallen.       Alex scoffs, walk into the house.
46) 0) text: They sit together now on sofas.       Alexandra appears d from crying.
46) 2) dialog: You want me to go around with you and tell everyone that Mom's going to die? What's the point of that? Breaking the news, watching them cry, dealing with their emotions. How depressing is that going to be? Just call them.
46) 4) dialog: I don't want to talk about Mom with anyone.
46) 9) dialog: I can't drop it.
46) 11) dialog: You really don't have a clue, do you? Dad, she was cheating on you.
46) 13) dialog: That's what we fought about. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with some guy. It made me sick to see her near you. I went back to school thinking that was it, I was done with her. I was going to call and tell you everything. But then the accident happened, and I was waiting until she woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't even suspect. Right? (off his silence) That disgusted me too. You're always so busy.
46) 15) dialog: Brandy and I were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool, and suddenly I see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house. His house, I guess.
46) 17) dialog: He had his hand on her ass.      It was gross.
46) 22) dialog: Then nothing. She went into the house. A few days later I told her I knew what she was doing.
46) 24) dialog: First she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Like I'm blind. Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it. That's when I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her.
46) 26) dialog: I don't know. Some guy.
46) 28) dialog: Dark hair. Matt stands up, walks in a little circle -- he literally not know which way to turn. Then he knows.
53) 0) text: Wandering up the driveway, Matt finds Alexandra sitting w Scottie and SOME GUY. Scottie now wears an oversized t-sh reading, "She's fat. I'm drunk. It's on." They stop laughing when they see Matt.
53) 2) dialog: Dad, this is Sid.
53) 11) dialog: Sid's coming with us, okay?
53) 13) dialog: Dad, I told you he was going to be with me. I'll be a lot more civil with him around.

56) 19) dialog: You suck, Sid.
56) 25) dialog: (noticing his anguish)
56) 28) dialog: Don't forget -- I know where he lives. Matt thinks a moment, then --
57) 2) dialog: I haven't surfed in years.
57) 4) dialog: At first I stopped because I got my period and didn't know how to use a tampon.
57) 6) dialog: So I wouldn't go for, you know, five days or so, and then I guess I just stopped.
58) 4) dialog: I didn't even tell her I got my period for like a year. She was always pushing me to look older and act older, so I just...
58) 6) dialog: The first time I got my period I thought I shit my pants.
58) 8) dialog: Sid, shut up.
59) 1) dialog: Do you know anything about him? Like what he does or if he's married?
59) 3) dialog: Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark?
59) 5) dialog: Why not?
59) 7) dialog: We'll google him later.    Okay, there it is. Stop.
59) 13) dialog: Well, I can't say for sure he lives there. That's just where I saw them.
59) 15) dialog: Sadie was driving. We both saw it.
59) 18) dialog: Sid, please be quiet.
59) 20) dialog: I don't know. I'm just showing you the house.
59) 22) dialog: Should I go ring the bell?
59) 25) dialog: It's not like we're stalking him exactly.
59) 29) dialog: What would you do if you saw him, anyway? Talk to him or punch him or what?
59) 32) dialog: Whatever, Sid.
59) 34) dialog: Depends on how you treated me.
59) 36) dialog: And we're not getting married.       Jesus.
60) 1) dialog: Dad, stop!
60) 3) dialog: Go back.
60) 8) dialog: Just go back a couple of houses.
60) 10) dialog: There he is.

60) 17) text: Alexandra climbs out of the car to grab a FLYER and take photo of Brian Speer with her phone.
64) 11) text: Alexandra approaches the bed slowly, startled by the chan in her mother's appearance and knowing the end is near.
64) 13) dialog: Hi, Mom.
64) 15) dialog: I guess it's in the genes.
64) 17) dialog: Hi, Mom. Sorry for being bad. For wasting your money on expensive private schools. Money you could have used on facials and massages and sports equipment. Sorry for everything. (looking at Matt) Sorry we weren't good enough for you -- especially Dad.
64) 30) text: Now! As Scottie runs outside -- ALEXANDRA
64) 33) dialog: I have every right to speak this way. I'm mad at her. How can you be so forgiving? Matt considers this. Of course she didn't see his recent outburst, and he's not about to let on. MATT
64) 38) text: And don't say that stuff in front of your sister. Don't ruin her for Scottie. Say something else. ALEXANDRA
64) 44) text: Wow. You're beautiful. (to Alexandra)
64) 71) text: No, I should go. I'll see you at the club. Hope your mom gets better. Exit Reina. ALEXANDRA
64) 73) text: She didn't believe Mom was sleeping. ALEXANDRA
64) 81) dialog: Hello? No, you've got the right number. This is his assistant Sharon. How may I help you? Alex listens.       Scottie has no idea what's going on, sure is fun.
64) 83) dialog: Oh, I see. And for how long? Uh-huh. Okay. So one or the other. I'll tell him. Mahalo. Alexandra hangs up, proud.         Matt's proud too.
64) 84) dialog: That was Bonnie Tanaka, a realtor. She says Mr. Speer is on Kaua'i till the 18th, but she'd be happy to show you the house or you can stop by the open house on Sunday.
68) 1) dialog: You've lost your mind.
69) 1) dialog: You mean him? Tell him to say goodbye?
69) 6) dialog: Drop it, Dad. You've got way bigger fish to fry than confronting fucking Brian Speer. Are you recording this?
69) 8) dialog: How can you work?
69) 10) dialog: To get Scottie out of the house. And you're going to tell him to come back and see Mom.
69) 12) dialog: Just call his office and say it's an emergency.
69) 15) dialog: Then I want to go too.
69) 17) dialog: Fuck that.     Let's all get out of town.
77) 15) dialog: Down there is where Mom and I would camp.
77) 18) dialog: We do. We still do. (to Matt) Do we really have to sell?

83) 10) dialog: What do you mean? You mean considering Mom's... circling the drain?
83) 12) dialog: No, Jesus, I'm not using.
83) 14) dialog: That's Sid.
83) 16) dialog: Look, Dad, it's no big deal. Kids do drugs and they stop. Unless they're like super-ghetto. And you sent me to boarding school, remember? I couldn't get anything anymore. So no, I'm not doing any drugs. But I still think they're fun. Okay, maybe a little pot once in a while.
83) 20) dialog: Mom's dying.
83) 25) dialog: Not much to be proud of.
83) 27) dialog: You want to know what really pisses me off? That she wouldn't end it. Not even when she knew she was busted. How are we supposed to feel about that?

83) 31) dialog: (getting up)
84) 7) dialog: I don't know. Take them out, stupid.

85) 10) dialog: Can we drop this? Jesus. (mimicking) "What do you love about Mom, Daddy?" Shut up, already. (to Matt) And stop babying her.
86) 5) dialog: When was that?
86) 7) dialog: Yeah?
87) 8) dialog: Why are we still talking about this? (then --) I like how she's not afraid of anything.

88) 12) dialog: I mean the earlier me, when I was mean to you and yelling at mom all the time.
88) 14) dialog: Well, Reina's going to be a meth-head, and she's going to get used by stupid guys. She's a twat. Say it.
88) 17) dialog: It'll go away.
93) 7) text: Matt gets to his feet, brushes off sand, and walks casual toward Mrs. Speer, maintaining a comfortable distance. Alexandra watches.

97) 0) text: Zero hour. Matt and Alexandra approach the cottage from t road and start to walk around it toward the beach.
97) 1) dialog: Are you ready?
97) 6) dialog: You'll think of something.          You're a lawyer.
97) 8) dialog: I'm the one who sucked you in.          I'm the one who knew.
97) 10) dialog: Don't be a pussy.
97) 16) dialog: (mouthing) Howdy?
97) 35) dialog: Do you need help?
97) 42) dialog: We're not here to hurt you. We just thought she'd want you to know. As they've plotted, Alex and Matt study Brian's paralyzed face. They exchange a glance, then look back at him.
97) 43) dialog: This is him? Why would she go for him?
97) 46) dialog: You're sorry my mom's going to die? You're sorry you fucked her? You're sorry you fucked over my dad?
97) 49) dialog: You must be good at that.
97) 57) dialog: We're talking about love.
97) 60) dialog: Awesome cottage you're renting.

112) 0) text: The door to Elizabeth's room opens, and Alexandra emerges far-away sadness on her face. She walks slowly toward --
113) 6) dialog: Steer straighter, Dad.     And a little faster, okay?
113) 13) text: Scottie does so. Alexandra takes the box reverently -- sh wants to perform this sad, strange ceremony without messi up.
