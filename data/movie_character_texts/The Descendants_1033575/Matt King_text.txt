They made business deals along the way -- buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land. Now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing. Hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction.
1) 1) dialog: My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawai'i, I live in paradise. Like a permanent vacation -- we're all just out here drinking mai- tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. Are they nuts? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up, our heart attacks and cancers less fatal, our grief less devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a surfboard in fifteen years.

2) 5) dialog: This is Elizabeth King, my wife. Twenty-three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned.

5) 11) dialog: I mean, I've kind of got my hands full. And her sister's away at school on the Big Island. I don't think Scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children.

8) 12) dialog: The whole goddamned state is following my decision on who's going to buy 35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has owned since the 1860s. My cousins and I meet in six days to approve a buyer. Ever since my father died nine years ago, I'm the sole trustee, the controlling trustee, so I hold all the cards. Why does so much have to depend on me -- my wife, my daughters, my family's land? I just want to hide.

I'll sell the land and quit my practice and buy her whatever she wants -- a big boat, a house in France, a trip around the world, just the two of us. We'll get close again, like the early days.

14) 9) dialog: As you may know, her mother isn't well, and maybe this is how she's dealing with it.
14) 14) dialog: Yeah, no, I get it.    I'm very sorry.
14) 18) text: Matt draws a long exasperated breath, as if everything el weren't enough already.
14) 19) dialog: See what I mean? Everybody sees me as the rich guy, the inheritor. People resent us. I resent us. Even our last name -- King. How irritating.
15) 0) text: Matt drives Scottie.
15) 1) dialog: You need to say you're sorry, and you need to mean it. No dicking around. I have a ton of work to do tonight. Do you have any idea how behind I am? You made her cry. Why would you want to be so mean to someone?
15) 3) dialog: Is that what you text all the time, nasty things?
15) 5) dialog: Well, what then?
15) 10) dialog: I should have known Reina had something to do with it. I don't want you hanging out with her.
15) 12) dialog: We'll make a deal. You apologize to this girl, and you talk to your mother, and then we'll see about Reina dropping by the hospital. Okay?

18) 10) dialog: Great. Well, nice meeting you both. Lani, you should come over sometime. Come for a swim or a hike or something.
18) 12) dialog: Hey, hey. We came over. She apologized. We're dealing with it. Kids are mean sometimes. They grow out of it. It's a kid thing. Here, Scottie, you're going to stop, right? And you're really, really sorry, right?
18) 15) dialog: No, she won't. It's like the time Lani locked Scottie out of the house at her birthday party and Scottie sat outside by herself. It was a mean thing to do, but Lani here probably did it just to show off, right?
18) 17) dialog: But I'm not about to declare that one action defines a human being's entire character. She's a work in progress, and like all complex people is a bundle of contradictions.
18) 23) dialog: You brought her cake. So, I don't know, maybe Lani should be the one to apologize, since this incident may have been the catalyst for all this... "evil" was the word you used.

She was originally supposed to marry her hanai brother, but she fell in love with her haole banker and estate manager, Edward King, whose parents were missionaries. Between his land deals and her huge inheritance, all of their descendants for generations have watched the past unfurl millions into our laps through leases and sales. Now the Rule Against Perpetuities is forcing us to dissolve the trust, and we're selling the last parcel of undeveloped land.

Don't be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen.

56) 12) dialog: You little fuck.   Do you get hit a lot?
56) 14) dialog: (to Alex) Your friend is completely retarded. You know that, right?
56) 16) text: Matt looks at him. Given who Sid is, there's no reason to think he wouldn't have a retarded brother.
56) 17) dialog: Oh.
56) 21) text: Rather than lashing out again at Sid, Matt turns around a lowers his head into one hand, squeezing his temples. It' all getting to be too much for him.

Along with draped LEIS, we see a childhoo DOLL, DIPLOMAS, and of course SPORTS MEDALS and RIBBONS. antique QUILT covers her legs. Her father meant it when h said they'd bring her old things. Matt crouches down bedside.
64) 1) dialog: You were going to ask me for a divorce? So you could be with some fucking fuckhead Brian Speer? Are you kidding me? Who are you? Because the only thing I know for sure is that you're a goddamned liar. So what do you have to say for yourself? Go ahead, make a little joke and tell me I've got it all wrong. Tell me again I'm too out of touch with my feelings and need to go to therapy. (then --)                                               * Isn't the idea of marriage to make your partner's way in life a little easier? For me it was always harder with you. And you're still making it harder. Lying there on a ventilator and still fucking up my life. You're relentless. You know what? I was going to ask you for a divorce some day.
64) 6) dialog: (grabbing a DOLL, tossing it) Daddy's little girl.

64) 39) text: Look, Mom, I know we fought a lot. But I always wanted to be like you. I am like you. I'm exactly like you. God, that came out so dramatic. MATT
64) 42) text: Hey, Mrs. K., howzit? I'm Sid, Alex's friend from Punahou, remember? Nice day outside. No clouds. Not too hot. You know what I think? Tough lady like you? I think you're going to make it. I mean, I'm no doctor. What do I know? But that's what I think. Matt squints at Sid.   Is he stoned? SID (CONT'D)
64) 50) dialog: Dammit, Scottie, no Reina.
64) 52) dialog: Not now.
64) 60) dialog: So, Reina, I hear your grandmother's not feeling well.
64) 64) text: Yeah. It's pretty bad. She got her stomach operated on and then got some stupid infection or something. It's pretty gross. MATT
64) 66) text: Too many carbs. MATT
64) 80) dialog: Where'd you learn how to talk like that? Scottie points at Alex. Matt's PHONE RINGS. He pulls it out to silence it but notices the CALLER ID -- KAIMANA-PRUDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. He freezes. Sensing something, Alex calmly grabs the phon from him and glances at it.

66) 9) dialog: I know. Buzz slinks off.
66) 10) dialog: You've all been asking about Elizabeth, and I've given vague answers. But the reason I've asked you all to come over today is to tell you...
67) 0) text: Matt addresses the gathering.
67) 1) dialog: ...that her coma is permanent.     She's not going to make it.
67) 6) dialog: This week -- tomorrow, in fact -- as per her wishes, we're going to unhook her from life-support. (holding for gasps) You all know Elizabeth -- she always likes to do things on her own. Goddammit. (almost losing it) I wanted to tell you all in person. You're all our dear friends, our best friends. And the girls and I appreciate so much all the ways you've helped these last few weeks -- bringing food, calling...
67) 8) dialog: Yes, for God's sake, yes. That's the whole point. Go see her as soon as possible. That's what I wanted to tell you. It should be now, not after. Everyone who loves her deserves a chance to say goodbye.
68) 0) text: Matt waves goodbye to the last guests as they drive off, turns back toward his house. Halfway there, his exhaustio forces him to COLLAPSE onto the moist lawn. Sitting there, he comes to a REALIZATION -- not one he wa but he knows he must deal with it regardless.

69) 9) dialog: How can you go to a movie?
69) 11) dialog: I think... I just think she would want him to know.

77) 11) dialog: I know, but we have to sell. The trust has to dissolve in seven years, and if we haven't sold, it'll be a huge mess. Selling now and distributing the cash is the only clean way to do it.
77) 13) dialog: (to his daughters) Take a good look, girls. In the old days, this was part of your great-great grandmother's inheritance going all the way back to Kamehameha I.
77) 16) dialog: We all did, all our lives.       A lot of memories.

83) 5) dialog: Just got off the phone with Dr. Johnston. They did what they had to do a couple hours ago. They've moved her to another floor. They say she seems comfortable, still breathing on her own. She's doing okay.
83) 9) dialog: So how are you doing, Alex?
83) 11) dialog: No, I mean other than that. In general. You haven't been using, have you?
83) 13) dialog: Not at all? I smell pot all the time on Sid.
83) 15) dialog: So you just stopped?   Really?
83) 17) dialog: And a little drinking.
83) 19) dialog: Why are you being so honest?

83) 28) dialog: I guess she really liked him.
83) 30) dialog: Right. Well, why don't you two take Scottie to the beach? I'm going to call around a little. We're on an island, for Christ's sake. Everything's just one degree of separation.

84) 11) dialog: The hotels were a dead end, but I took another shot with his office. He's definitely in Hanalei renting a house somewhere -- probably one of those cottages around the bay. Who wants to go for a walk?
84) 13) text: Matt grimaces -- not whom he was hoping for.         Alex straps of her bikini and flips over.
85) 5) dialog: I was with a law school buddy from the mainland, and I took him to the club. We were just coming in from paddling, and your mom was on her way out, and she looked at me and said, "Do you think it's going to snow today?" We all got beers when she came back in. I had already seen her around. That was it. I got her number.
85) 7) dialog: She knocked me out.
85) 9) dialog: I love... I don't know. The way we are with each other, most of the time, anyway. I love how she's more capable of feeling joy than anyone I've ever known. I just like being with her, just riding bikes or going out to dinner, even if it's just a plate lunch at Rainbow's. Years ago we used to do a lot of paddling together.
85) 11) dialog: Easy, Alex. We're just talking.
86) 4) dialog: Your mom got chased by a shark once. Very close call.
86) 6) dialog: We were on Moloka'i with Mark and Kai, and your mom was out surfing and saw a shark right beneath her on a wave. Like right beneath her. She got down on her stomach and started paddling like crazy, and this big fin kept following her. She even paddled up onto the nearest rocks instead of all the way to shore. Got cuts all over her legs and hands. Only time I ever saw your mother scared, and she was really scared. She even threw up. Crying and shaking. I had to hold her for a long time.   She really thought she was going to die. Of course she hid all that from the Mitchells, turned it into a funny "Me-versus-a-shark" story. I told her...
86) 8) dialog: I told her it wasn't her time yet.
87) 1) dialog: I'll ask you that same question, Scottie. What do you love about Mom?
88) 5) dialog: Were you there?    Have you seen any of those movies?
88) 16) dialog: Stop that! (to Alexandra) I don't get it. I don't know what to do... these things she does. What goes on in her head? You weren't like that.
88) 18) dialog: I'm not so sure. I mean, look how you kids talk in front of me. It's like you don't respect authority.
89) 0) text: Matt tosses and turns, gets up and goes to the bathroom.

90) 8) dialog: I don't, uh... I haven't been sleeping very much lately.
90) 10) dialog: I'm worried about my daughters. I'm worried there's something wrong with them.
90) 12) dialog: What does Alex really think about this stuff that's going on? What does she say?
90) 14) dialog: What do you mean? I thought she talks to you all the time.
90) 16) dialog: What would you do if you were me? How would you handle my daughters? How would you handle... the situation of this guy we're trying to find?
90) 17) text: Matt can't believe what he just asked, but he's desperate clues from even the unlikeliest source.
90) 22) dialog: Do you want some of it?   Some money?
90) 24) dialog: If I gave you a lot of money right now, tonight, would you leave?
90) 26) dialog: No, Sid, I'm asking you a favor.    If I give you money, will you leave?
90) 28) dialog: I guess not.
90) 30) dialog: Then I might wind up with something like you.
90) 32) dialog: You're about a hundred miles away from Smartville. No offense.
90) 37) dialog: I'm sure your parents are proud.
90) 39) dialog: What does she do, your mom?

97) 18) dialog: I'm Matt King.       This is Alexandra.
97) 25) dialog: Yeah, no, I know, yeah, super-involved. Maybe I've met him in passing. I don't know.

97) 44) dialog: Beats me.    Well, he's very articulate.
97) 48) dialog: Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life. I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. I don't know how long you're planning on being here, but I'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave.
97) 50) dialog: You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. Do you hear what I'm saying?

97) 64) dialog: Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind. Just a quick look.
98) 2) dialog: How did you meet?    I'm curious. For a moment Brian looks tricked, as if Matt really did j want a tour of the house.
98) 4) dialog: Neither can I.    How did you meet?
98) 6) dialog: I changed my mind. And I can't very well ask her the details. How'd you meet?
98) 8) dialog: What party?
98) 10) dialog: (figuring it out)
98) 16) dialog: Hey, I'm doing you a favor here. I could go out there right now and fuck you up, so get a better attitude. Then what? How'd you get the nerve to ask her out?
98) 18) dialog: I want to know what makes a person cross that line. Was it about the deal? Is that when you decided she was for you?

98) 24) dialog: Did she say she loved you?
98) 26) dialog: Do you love her?
98) 28) dialog: You don't love her. You don't love her. You just used her to get to me.
98) 35) dialog: Then I guess it's all working out. Her lips are sealed, and you don't have to go through the trouble of dumping her.
98) 37) dialog: Too bad her husband found out. You can't win `em all. One more question. Have you ever been inside my bedroom?
98) 40) dialog: You could have had the decency to lie about that one. Well, she's in Queen's Hospital if you want to say goodbye. That really is all I came to say.
