95) 7) dialog: Heeey! Mattie-boy! What are you doing here? I didn't expect to see you until the meeting. He looks over his shoulder to see whom Matt might have co in with.
95) 8) dialog: Is that...?
95) 10) dialog: Big girls now! So what are you doing here, man?
95) 15) dialog: Yeah, boy, what you've been going through. That's a tough deal. (taking a drink) But Elizabeth, hey, she's, she's a tough gal, I'll tell you that. A fighter. She'll make it. Get you a drink?

95) 21) dialog: Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a- bitch. He's Lou's sister's... No, wait. Lou has a sister, and the sister's husband... Lou's brother-in- law is cousins with that guy.
95) 23) dialog: No, wait. You mean the cottages on the bay or the cottage back by the trail?
95) 28) dialog: Yeah, that's right. Determined son-of- a-bitch. Anyway, the point is the guy we're doing business with is that guy's brother-in-law. Works for him.
95) 30) dialog: That's the guy.
95) 32) dialog: Who do you think? Don Holitzer.
95) 34) dialog: That's what I'm saying. That's Don's brother-in-law in the cottage. You don't know him? I would have thought you'd know him. He's a realtor over by you. So if we sell to Don -- and that's what we're going to do, right? That's what you want too. Nice guy, Don. He'll do right by us. Then when Don develops and re-sells and leases and all that --
95) 36) dialog: He's letting this brother-in-law in the cottage handle the transactions. A lot of them, anyway. Big score for that guy. It takes a moment for this stone to drop to the bottom of Matt's well.

95) 43) dialog: Not much. He's lucky. The bugga's lucky. His sister is married to the guy. Son-of-a-bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions.

At least there ain't going to be any Wal-Mart. Now it's your call, and we're all behind you, most of us anyway. (handing him a pen) Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.
110) 11) dialog: What's strange?
110) 15) dialog: What're you doing, Matt? I mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now, but you're not going to fuck this up for us. It's over. If we don't sell now, it'll be a mess when the trust dissolves. Just sign, go to your wife, done.
110) 25) dialog: Your head's not right, Mattie. Your head's not right. You want a couple days to think it over? Take a couple days.
110) 28) dialog: You're the trustee. You know better than anyone we only have seven years left.
