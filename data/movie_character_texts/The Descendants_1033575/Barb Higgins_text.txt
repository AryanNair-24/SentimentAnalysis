13) 2) dialog: Yes, it is.
13) 7) dialog: Yes, Lani is a classmate of Scottie's, yes.
14) 2) dialog: Let's see, where to start? It's Scottie. She's been texting some awful things to Lani, and I'd like her to stop.
14) 4) dialog: Here's the latest one. "We all know you grew pubes over the summer." She sends little messages like that for no reason. She even wrote it on Lani's Facebook wall.
14) 6) dialog: She calls my daughter Lanikai, implying she's like the size of an entire neighborhood. Do you think that's nice?
14) 10) dialog: I don't care about the backstory, Mr. King. My daughter comes home from school in tears.
14) 15) dialog: Scottie should be the one who's sorry. I want her to come over and apologize to Lani, and I don't ever want her to write to my daughter again.
14) 17) dialog: If she doesn't apologize, I'm going to tell the headmaster. You can't buy your way out of this.
17) 0) text: BARB HIGGINS answers the door.
17) 1) dialog: Thank you for coming by.
18) 1) dialog: I forgot to mention the time Scottie said she didn't want to be Lani's partner at the rock wall because she didn't want to fall into my daughter's butt crack. That doesn't even make sense.
18) 11) dialog: Scottie, the things you said were simply evil. Do you realize that? I don't know what's led you to be such a nasty young lady.
18) 14) dialog: I don't think she's sorry at all. She's going to keep doing it. I can tell.
18) 18) dialog: I didn't know about that.
19) 1) dialog: Oh, and Mr. King?
19) 3) dialog: Good luck with the sale. Matt turns to look at her.    So that's what all this was on some level?
19) 4) dialog: They say your decision will have a major impact on Hawai'i's real estate world, not to mention the whole landscape of Kaua'i. Hundreds of millions of dollars, yeah?
19) 6) dialog: My husband's family is from Kaua'i. Hanapepe, born and bred. They hope you don't sell.
19) 8) dialog: All the traffic it's going to make. Matt and Scottie walk away.   Barb closes the door.
