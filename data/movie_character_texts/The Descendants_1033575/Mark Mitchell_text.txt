27) 0) text: -- friends MARK AND KAI MITCHELL up for a visit. They're playing MUSIC for Elizabeth on a mini-boombox, and Kai is APPLYING MAKE-UP to Liz's face. After cheery greetings --
27) 3) text: Matt and Mark exchange a look -- "Girls."
27) 4) dialog: And of course Kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip.
27) 10) dialog: So what's the latest anyway, Matt?    Any updates?
50) 5) text: MARK AND KAI appear at the top of the stairs looking as though they haven't been downstairs all day.
50) 11) dialog: Stupid.
50) 13) dialog: It's work that's totally unnecessary. You don't have to do anything. Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail. We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out. It's more fun that way, anyway.
50) 15) dialog: You know what? We can talk about it later. Matt didn't come over to hear us squabble.
50) 28) dialog: You don't know him.
50) 30) dialog: I'm Matt's friend too. And this is a very unique and dramatic situation. I'd want to know.
50) 37) text: So you're going to talk to me in clichГ©s about women? Nothing is ever a woman's fault. Was it still going on when she had the accident? Kai looks away.    Mark nods. MARK
50) 41) text: I almost told you yesterday. She's never going to wake up. It's for sure now. You hear me? We're pulling the plug. You were putting lipstick on a corpse. MARK
50) 42) text: Come on, Matt.    That's a little intense. Kai's face dissolves into tears. Mark reaches out to comf her. Everybody falls back to Earth. MATT
51) 0) text: Just as Matt reaches the sidewalk, Mark comes loping out the house.
51) 1) dialog: Brian Speer. His name is Brian Speer. Two e's. A PET GOAT tied up in the front yard watches.
