55) 0) text: Matt watches retired military man SCOTT THORSON (70s) mum as he sits at a table glancing over DOCUMENTS. Sid is splayed out on a nearby lounge chair. Alex seated his feet. Every so often a PET PARROT squawks loudly.
55) 1) dialog: This is like reading Korean.
55) 3) dialog: (tossing the papers)
55) 6) dialog: I know goddamn well what it says. Says she doesn't want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk. Says if the doctors can't do squat, she'd just as soon get on with it. He stares off into space.
55) 8) dialog: Elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here. Always a thoughtful girl. A strong girl. A hell of a lot stronger than her brother. Barry whines his way through life. Might even be a homosexual, for all I know.
55) 13) dialog: And she's stronger than you, Matt. She lived more in a year than you did in a decade, sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash. All that money you refuse to use -- what the hell good is it? And now you and your family are cashing in your chips -- what the hell for? Maybe if you'd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like, maybe she wouldn't have gone in for those thrill sports. Maybe if you'd provided more thrills at home.
55) 15) dialog: And you, Alexandra. Putting your poor mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you. Shame on you. You should try to be more like her. She's a good girl. She's a good girl.
55) 17) dialog: You all want a drink?
55) 26) text: Hi, Tutu. SCOTT THORSON
55) 28) text: Hello. SCOTT THORSON
55) 32) text: Good afternoon. SCOTT THORSON
55) 35) text: Is she serious? SCOTT THORSON
55) 42) dialog: Shut up, Alice. (then --)
55) 46) dialog: I'm going to hit you. Scott POPS HIS FIST into Sid's face.           Sid FLIES
103) 4) dialog: Here we are. (to Scottie) Hi, Bingo. Alex.
103) 6) dialog: (eyeing Sid) There you are again.
103) 8) dialog: So what did you decide?
103) 10) dialog: I mean what did you decide about the buyer? Who's your buyer?
103) 12) dialog: How much are you getting?
103) 14) dialog: I don't need to read about it.     I can hear about it right now.
103) 19) dialog: All the same to you, I guess. A million here, a million there. Just ironic, that's all -- Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you're coming into a fortune. She gave you everything, Matt. A good, happy home, two beautiful daughters. Matt looks to Barry for help, but Barry's silence and sheepish look imply he buys into his father's propaganda.
103) 21) dialog: She wanted her own boat. She should have had her own boat, one she would have been familiar with.
103) 23) dialog: Sure, sure, quibble about the details. She was a faithful, devoted wife. She deserved more. Why fight it?
104) 6) dialog: (opening his eyes)
