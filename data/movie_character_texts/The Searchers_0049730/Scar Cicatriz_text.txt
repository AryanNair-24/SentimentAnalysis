159) 13) text: Scar looks at it greedily, then nods. He'll accept it. He looks at Ethan. Again that faintly contemptuous smile. He signals them to enter his tepee.
160) 0) text: A small fire burns in the center of the lodge and a shaft sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak. Two chunky squaws, who have been tending the fire or grin corn in a rock pestle, scuttle to a side of the tepee. Tw others, one half-grown and the other slightly taller, sit with their backs to the fire, huddled over some leather w or stitching. Both are shawled. As Scar enters, he barks word to the squaws near the fire.

It has several scalps on it, including on with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar nev takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring  every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between th so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists.  Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than the scalp pole... Then slowly their eyes lift... and the  CAMERA MOVES IN and RAISES TO:
163) 1) dialog: (in Comanche) Pie-kay! (Go!)
164) 2) text: Scar's eyes are mocking. He lets his robe slip back from shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- gli in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan had given Debbie. It is suspended by a chain or rawhide  string. Scar touches it.
164) 3) dialog: This before?
164) 4) text: Ethan smiles -- and he's still playing poker. He stands.. and the others follow. Scar is puzzled.

196) 0) dialog: He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse l In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air  suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs.

202) 1) dialog: He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knif in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see t other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd.
