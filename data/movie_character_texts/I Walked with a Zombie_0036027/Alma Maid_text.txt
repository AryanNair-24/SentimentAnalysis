41) 0) text: It is a beautiful woman's bedroom, feminine but with no suggestion of the bagnic; elegant rather than seductive, reflecting a playful yet sophisticated taste.  The furnit is Biedermeier.  There is a large bed, a trim chaise loun a little slipper chair and in one corner of the room, tha hallmark of great vanity, a triple-screen, full-length mirror, also a Biedermeier style.  Before it is a taboure the surface of which is literally covered with expensive looking perfume bottles and cosmetic jars.  Mrs. Holland evidently taken the tasks of beauty seriously enough to s up to them.  There is one picture in the room.  It is Boecklin's "The Isle of the Dead," framed in a narrow fra of dark wood.  Near the open window stands a beautiful gi parlour harp. (Size 22)  Behind it, arranged conveniently playing, is a small Empire chair.  There is no other furniture near this arrangement, and the harp, the empty chair and wind-stirred glass curtains give a dual effect elegance and loneliness. The CAMERA is FOCUSED on this harp as the scene opens.  T glass curtains blown by the wind, steal across the string bringing forth tinkling notes. The CAMERA PANS RIGHT to reveal Betsy and Dr. Maxwell at Holland's bedside.  Dr. Maxwell is a small, neat man with charming voice and a pleasant but somewhat professional personality.  He is dressed in tropical whites and wears cummerbund.  Alma is removing the breakfast tray and, as passes Betsy on her way to the door, she makes a little curtsey.  Mrs. Holland is lying back against the pillows her bed in a semi-reclining position.

57) 21) dialog: No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
57) 23) dialog: Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.  The CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE TWO SHOT of both women's faces,  Betsy looking thoughtfully at Alma and Alma retur the gaze with equal intensity.
