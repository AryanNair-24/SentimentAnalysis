11) 1) text: Fort Holland is a one-story house built around the garden with low covered porches to give shade and breezeway.  At open end of the U is a great gate much like the wrought-i gates of New Orleans.  Through this Betsy can see the gar and its profusion of verdure: azalea, bougainvillea, rose much like California planting; no exotic orchids or man eating Venus Jugs -- just ordinary, pretty, semi-tropic flowers and shrubs. The separate rooms are open to the garden, but have jalou of thin wood to give privacy when needed.  At one corner stands a big, stone tower, obviously a relic of some prev building.  The walls of the house have been built right u and around the tower so that it has become part of the building itself.  On the garden side of the tower is the fountain. The most outstanding feature of this spring or fountain, which flows from a crevice in the stones of the tower, is that instead of falling directly into the ciste it falls first onto the shoulders of the enormous teakwoo figurehead of St. Sebastian. From the shoulders of the sa it drips down in two runnels over his breast.  The wooden breast of the statue is pierced with six long iron arrows The face is weathered and black.  Only a few bits of whit paint still cling to the halo above his head.  Betsy and coachman come up to the grillwork of the gate.  Betsy loo around the garden, while the old coachman reaches up and pulls a bell rope suspended from the gate.  As the bell begins to ring, he pushes the gate open.  Betsy walks through.
