The furnit is Biedermeier.  There is a large bed, a trim chaise loun a little slipper chair and in one corner of the room, tha hallmark of great vanity, a triple-screen, full-length mirror, also a Biedermeier style.  Before it is a taboure the surface of which is literally covered with expensive looking perfume bottles and cosmetic jars.  Mrs. Holland evidently taken the tasks of beauty seriously enough to s up to them.  There is one picture in the room.  It is Boecklin's "The Isle of the Dead," framed in a narrow fra of dark wood.  Near the open window stands a beautiful gi parlour harp. (Size 22)  Behind it, arranged conveniently playing, is a small Empire chair.

The CAMERA is FOCUSED on this harp as the scene opens.  T glass curtains blown by the wind, steal across the string bringing forth tinkling notes. The CAMERA PANS RIGHT to reveal Betsy and Dr. Maxwell at Holland's bedside.  Dr. Maxwell is a small, neat man with charming voice and a pleasant but somewhat professional personality.  He is dressed in tropical whites and wears cummerbund.  Alma is removing the breakfast tray and, as passes Betsy on her way to the door, she makes a little curtsey.  Mrs. Holland is lying back against the pillows her bed in a semi-reclining position.

41) 11) dialog: Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician.  But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.

65) 2) dialog: Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
65) 9) dialog: This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
65) 15) text: It doesn't matter what you call it.  I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going! Dr. Maxwell looks first at him, then at Holland, then bac Rand.

71) 17) text: I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
71) 31) dialog: I think I do.   (smiling)
71) 38) text: That night, I went to the Houmfort.  I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart.  The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.
