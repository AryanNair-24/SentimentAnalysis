9) 0) text: St. Sebastian is a drab little West Indian village.  The shacks and houses of wood, lath and plaster seem to be falling apart.  Over the doorway of one of the buildings evidently an administrative office -- hangs an American f indicating the government of the island.  The hard-packed dirt in the roadway is overgrown with weeds.  Everywhere, moving indolently, are the little, badly nourished negroe some of them tending stalls and sidewalk vending booths, others walking idly.  Betsy, followed by a black sailor w her suitcases, comes down the gangway.  Parallel to this gangway is another.  Up the second gangway, in file, black stevedores with bun of sugar cane and small bales of sisal hemp on their head go up to the boat.  On the dock, Betsy makes her way through a group of clamo children, vendors and beggars.  As the black sailor puts luggage into an umbrella-topped surrey drawn by a gaunt m she stops, delighted, before a great basket filled with enormous white flowers.  The man seated beside the basket seems to be asleep, his face hidden by the drooping brim straw hat.  Betsy picks up one of the blooms, smells it a then looks at the vendor.
9) 1) dialog: How much is this? The vendor wakens and lifts his head, revealing a face bloated and scarified by yaws, a hideous nightmare face.  Betsy, startled, steps back, letting the flower drop.  Pa Holland, passing her, looks at this little tableau of hor and disgust.

11) 1) text: Fort Holland is a one-story house built around the garden with low covered porches to give shade and breezeway.  At open end of the U is a great gate much like the wrought-i gates of New Orleans.  Through this Betsy can see the gar and its profusion of verdure: azalea, bougainvillea, rose much like California planting; no exotic orchids or man eating Venus Jugs -- just ordinary, pretty, semi-tropic flowers and shrubs. The separate rooms are open to the garden, but have jalou of thin wood to give privacy when needed.  At one corner stands a big, stone tower, obviously a relic of some prev building.  The walls of the house have been built right u and around the tower so that it has become part of the building itself.  On the garden side of the tower is the fountain. The most outstanding feature of this spring or fountain, which flows from a crevice in the stones of the tower, is that instead of falling directly into the ciste it falls first onto the shoulders of the enormous teakwoo figurehead of St. Sebastian. From the shoulders of the sa it drips down in two runnels over his breast.  The wooden breast of the statue is pierced with six long iron arrows The face is weathered and black.  Only a few bits of whit paint still cling to the halo above his head.  Betsy and coachman come up to the grillwork of the gate.  Betsy loo around the garden, while the old coachman reaches up and pulls a bell rope suspended from the gate.  As the bell begins to ring, he pushes the gate open.  Betsy walks through.

This is Wesley Rand.  The table by which he stands set for two and lit by candelabra in great glass hurrican lamps.  The table is laid with white linen, and the candlelight gleams on silver and cut-glass arranged in th most formal manner.  The table itself is a beautiful maho structure with elaborate carving, and the four chairs whi surround it are massive Victorian pieces.  A fifth chair stands by the wall.

It is a rickety structure of poles and laths, roofed over with a thin tha of sugar cane and straw.  It forms a sort of rude pergola In the center of this structure is a small, cubicle hut, of rough boards but neatly whitewashed.  From the rafters the main structure hang crude chandeliers of tin which gi light to the ceremonies. (Please see pages 28 to 31, Life Magazine, December 13, 1 All the details mentioned above are graphically illustrat Near the little hut in the center of the Houmfort, stands altar covered with a lace tablecloth and littered with a childish jumble of plates, candles, little colored stones bottles.  Before this altar stands the Houngan, the high priest of the voodoo ceremonies, a small, stoop-shouldere man in a worn, white coat and trousers with ragged cuffs. Several mild-looking negroes in white trousers and shirts in kitchen chairs on one side of the altar with rada drum between their knees.  Grouped around this altar in a loos semicircle are the worshippers, a group of mild-mannered, poorly-but-neatly-dressed negroes.  They seem to have mad effort to dress in their best and their best is very poor indeed.    As Betsy approaches, she can see familiar face As she comes up they turn and look at her.  They are not hostile nor greatly surprised; just mildly curious.  Lead Jessica by the hand, Betsy takes her place at one end of semicircle around the altar.  Her arrival has in no way interrupted the ceremonies.  The Houngan continues to cha before the altar, the rada drums beat and the crowd sings chorus of the Shango song at the proper intervals.  It is very decorous and decidedly religious in tone.  No sooner Betsy taken her place with the others than the Shango rit approaches its climax.  The Sabreur, a colored man dresse white shirt and trousers, with a neat dark tie knotted un his collar, comes in, bearing a sabre in his right hand, holding it in stately, almost processional manner.  He advances to the altar, strikes it three times and at this signal two colored women dressed in white beguine dresses with square cut necks, an essential part of this religiou costume, come forward.  One holds a white leghorn chicken the other carries a white rooster. They come together to altar and for a moment, the figures of the Houngan, the Sabreur and the two Mam-Lois hide the actual blood sacrif from us.  Only the fact that the drumming and the singing reach a climactic pitch reveal that some Important portio the ceremony has taken place.  Instantly the drumming and singing stops.  A young colored girl jumps up from her se among the worshippers and begins shivering and quaking, crying out wordlessly.  There is a cry from the people.
