A country and western tune drifts to u from it's radio. As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roof shingles from their station wagon.

What the hell is going on? Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, gla up at him.  He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dir revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood soaked dirt which sticks to his hand.
