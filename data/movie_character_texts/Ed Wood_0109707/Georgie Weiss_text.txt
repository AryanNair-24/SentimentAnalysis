SCREEN CLASSICS Гі SAME TIME It's a crowded root, piled with paperwork and files.  Fil are stacked everywhere, and framed oneГіsheets for "TEST BABIES," "BLONDE PICKUP" and "GIRL GANG" litter the crack walls.  Sitting behind the messy desk is GEORGIE WEISS, 6 rug merchant turned exploitation film producer.  He juggl large sandwich and angrily barks into the phone. GEORGIE (on phone)
11) 1) text: Look, when I said you could have the western territories, I didn't mean all eleven states!  I meant California, Oregon, and uh, what's that one above it... Washington.  Oh really?!  Well screw you! Georgie slams down the phone.  He smiles warmly at Ed.
11) 2) dialog: Can I help you?
11) 4) dialog: Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
11) 7) dialog: No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preГіsold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it. Georgie bites into his sandwich.  Ed is dazed.
11) 9) dialog: Fuck no!  But there's a poster. Georgie pulls out artwork of a hermaphrodite: Man on the side, woman on the right.  The lettering screams, "I CHAN
11) 11) dialog: It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
11) 14) dialog: Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications." Ed takes a measured piuse.  This is his big revelation.
11) 17) dialog: Are you a fruit?
11) 19) dialog: So you're not a fruit?
11) 22) dialog: You gotta be kiddin' me.
11) 24) dialog: And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
11) 26) dialog: Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but look around you... (he gestures at the posters)
23) 0) text: Ed sits across from Georgie.  Ed's very excited.
23) 1) dialog: So what's the big news you couldn't tell me over the phone... again? Ed gulps excitedly.  He has a spiel all planned out.
23) 3) dialog: (he thinks)
23) 6) dialog: Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
23) 8) dialog: Yeah.  Crap with a star.
23) 11) dialog: Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about. Ed grins.
23) 13) dialog: (skeptical)
23) 15) dialog: Lugosi?
23) 17) dialog: Isn't he dead?
23) 20) dialog: OUR picture?
23) 22) text: Uh, yeah.  Our picture. Georgie mulls this over.  He's interested.
23) 23) dialog: Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
23) 25) dialog: Alright, fine!  You can direct it. I want a script in three days, and we start shooting a week from Monday.
27) 2) dialog: I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
27) 5) dialog: Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
27) 7) dialog: And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
27) 9) text: It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA. Georgie throws up his hands
27) 10) dialog: Fine, shoot whatever baloney you want!  I give up.  Just make sure it's seven reels long.
29) 4) dialog: Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio Beach                          What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
29) 6) dialog: Then how's it gonna get in the picture?!
31) 0) text: On a MOVIOLA, we see the black-and-white image of Dolores taking off her angora and giving it to Ed. WE PULL OUT.  Ed and Georgie are hunched over, watching t movie.  Ed smiles proudly.
31) 2) text: What do you think? Georgie peers at his watch.  He shakes his bead.
31) 3) dialog: I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
31) 5) dialog: (like a lecturing teacher)
31) 8) dialog: They'll notice. (beat)
31) 11) dialog: Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
31) 13) dialog: And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer. Ed is quite upset.
31) 15) dialog: Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he                         Ed is beaten.
32) 15) dialog: I did.  I established some tits and ass. Ed rolls his eyes.  He turns back to the movie.
41) 2) dialog: (pissed-off)
41) 5) dialog: Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
41) 8) dialog: Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
41) 10) dialog: "Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!! Georgie SLAMS down the phone.  His split screen WIPES off leaving Ed standing alone. Ed stares at the phone, then quietly hangs it up.
