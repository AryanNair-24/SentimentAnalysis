26) 1) dialog: Until you officially take over the  office of National Drug Control  Policy, under no circumstances should  you speak to the press unprotected,  without going through this office or  having someone in the room.  There  are a lot of interests in this town  and, right now, they're all scared  of you.  The reason they're scared  of you...technically, you have veto  power over their budgets.  So think  about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS,  TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio  Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna  want to speak to you.  And that's  the good news... You'll also be  meeting Senators and Congressman,  each with a specially prepared  question.  Their question is designed  for one thing: to make them look  smart.  If you lecture them, they  won't think you respect them.  If  you respond with utter humility,  they will.  Remember, this is about  your respect for them, and the  President's respect for them.   Speaking of which, as soon as he  gets back from Russia and China,  we'll get you in there for some face- time, let the two of you catch up. (beat)
