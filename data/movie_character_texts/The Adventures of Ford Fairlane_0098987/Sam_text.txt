Ford smiles, turns to the bar, and takes a last sip from his shake before smashing the fountain glass into the face of the stuttering Sam, sending him off his barstool. The sleazebag leaps up like a wild animal and swings his fist at Ford.  Ford grabs onto the flying fist, stopping it dead.  Sam sharply swings his other fist around, but Ford grabs this one, too, locking them into an Arthur Murray lesson position.

Sam crawls out from under one table and makes under the long tablecloth of another.  The crowd has taken an activ interest, but the band continues to play.
7) 66) text: Ford lifts up the tablecloth.  The sleazebag fanatic is not there.  Ford bobs back up with a puzzled expression and puts a cigarette in his mouth. Ford brings out a lighter as the fanatic suddenly materializes behind him.  Sam grabs a huge glass candle holder from one of the tables and smashes off the end of it, causing a jagged edge.  The band stops playing as the CANDLE SIZZLES in Sam's hand.

Ford SQUEAKS off the CAR ALARM with a beeper and then opens up his unusually modulated trunk.  Sam the Sleazebag is seen huddled in a heap within.  Ford tosses a smashed-up Twinkie to him and recloses the trunk to frenzied screams.

Ford sadly blinks before looking to a gun rack on the wall that holds three shotguns.  Ford wobbles over to an entertainment system set up next to the rack.  He turns OFF the eerie rocker on the STEREO.  A video cassette marked "Collie and Me" lies on an adjoining VCR.  Ford puts the tape in.
