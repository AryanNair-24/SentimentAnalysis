10) 6) dialog: Exactly.
10) 7) text: Ford chuckles and a romantic whether-they-like-it-or-not moment passes between them.  Jazz breaks it to look under her desk.

10) 40) dialog: Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make Crocodile Dundee three.
10) 42) dialog: You're saying you need money.
10) 44) dialog: Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...

10) 47) dialog: (sneezing) Bim-bo.

10) 54) dialog: Six.  Take it, you need it.
10) 55) text: A PHONE on Jazz's desk RINGS and Ford instantly picks it
10) 58) dialog: That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
10) 60) text: Jazz takes the phone and puts it in a modem cradle -- two cups that fit over each end of the phone, all hooked up to her computer.  The horrible COMPUTER NOISES become nicely inaudible.

28) 2) dialog: Spooky.  I'll process her.
42) 4) text: A couple of gasps rise up out of the patrons around them. Ford and Colleen feel the breeze of heads turning all around them.  They turn to see what everybody is looking at.

46) 11) dialog: Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.

57) 4) dialog: Contacts.

73) 4) text: The Punk Gunslinger pushes Jazz back against the Heavy Metal Gunslinger.  The Metal Gunslinger grabs her arms while the Punk grabs her legs.  They swing Jazz back and forth three times before heaving her SMASH! through the plate GLASS WINDOW of the office.

76) 12) dialog: I came to warn you...
76) 15) text: Zuzu pulls out the red number one Black Vomit C.D. from her purse.  She goes to the compact disc player and slides it in. The painful COMPUTER SCREECHES:  SCRE-E-E-E!  BUZZ! SHSHSHSHSHSH! come croaking out the SPEAKERS.  The Sorority Sisters hold their ears, whimpering in pain, while Zuzu obliviously tries to dance to it.  Ford and Jazz smile at each other.
76) 18) text: Jazz takes the Black Vomit compact disc case (with a red number on it) from Jazz and holds it up.
76) 19) dialog: I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words... (in Ford's gruff, facetious tone) 'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
76) 25) dialog: You're not funny.
76) 29) text: Jazz slides Colleen's disc in the C.D. modem.  More scrambled nonsense of a different kind appears on the screen.
76) 32) dialog: Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
84) 43) text: Jazz rushes up to the surly pair, wearing an eyepatch and a forearm cast.
84) 44) dialog: How'd it go?
84) 45) text: Ford and Zuzu give Jazz the look of death before contin- uing down the sidewalk, their heads drearily looking down.
84) 47) dialog: Johnny's C.D.?
84) 49) dialog: And maybe the stars correlate with a map in the Thomas Guide... sounds pretty decaf, doesn't it?

90) 4) dialog: C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
90) 6) dialog: But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
92) 2) dialog: It started after Old Jack Grendel died, the others were just investors.

95) 6) dialog: Please say you won't move!  I don't want to shoot you, actually I wouldn't mind, but please, say you won't move.
95) 8) dialog: I guess that's a no...
95) 9) text: Jazz EMPTIES the GUN into his chest, sending him to the ground.  Sam wearily rises up.
95) 10) dialog: Come on, Sam, vodka milkshakes are on me.
