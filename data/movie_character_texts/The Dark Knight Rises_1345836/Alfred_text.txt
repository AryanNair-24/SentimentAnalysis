20) 2) dialog: I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried. He won't see you.
20) 5) dialog: Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones.
20) 9) dialog: The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib. 13.
24) 2) dialog: Miss Tate was asking to see you again.
24) 5) dialog: And quite lovely, in case you were wondering.
24) 8) dialog: What are you doing?
24) 11) dialog: And this is your idea of raising the alarm?
24) 14) dialog: She?

29) 23) dialog: At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world.
29) 26) dialog: And that's the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won't get out there and find a life. Find someone -

66) 2) dialog: Just you, sir?
66) 7) dialog: Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a little time to get back into the swing of things. Wayne dials his phone.
67) 3) dialog: You've got the wrong leg, sir.
67) 6) dialog: It is terribly painful?
67) 10) dialog: Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his fee 47.

100) 1) dialog: Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower? 64.
100) 5) dialog: From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back.
100) 7) dialog: Shouldn't the police be gathering the evidence?
100) 10) dialog: They would if you gave them to them
100) 14) dialog: In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon.
100) 17) dialog: Perhaps they would've if you haven't made a sideshow of yourself.
100) 19) dialog: Wrong? 65.
100) 23) dialog: You don't. You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him. What then?
100) 27) dialog: When you had something to fight for. What are you fighting for now? Not your life. Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his hand.

101) 2) dialog: I'll get this to Fox. But no more. Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.
101) 4) dialog: I've sewn you up and set your bones...but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.
101) 7) dialog: You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore - you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave -

101) 15) dialog: What if, before she died, she'd written a letter? Explaining that she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you? Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -

101) 21) dialog: Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I haven't.
101) 24) dialog: I've never lied to you. Except when I burned Rachel's letter. Wayne turns on the old man, furious.
101) 27) dialog: I'm using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. I'm sorry. 68.
101) 31) dialog: No. I know what this means -
101) 33) dialog: It means your hatred. It means losing the person I've cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.
