25) 14) dialog: Or instinct.
25) 17) dialog: Blake, sir.
25) 19) dialog: It's that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died.
25) 22) dialog: The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent's neck...then just vanishes?
25) 25) dialog: Don't you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushe his fingers across its rusted shell.

But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. I remember that just fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot of people who know what it feels like, do they? To be angry. In your bones. People understand, foster parents understand. For a while. Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. To move on. To forget.
50) 16) dialog: So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys' home - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. See, I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger. Practice smiling in the mirror. Like putting on a mask. You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm.
50) 21) dialog: We were so excited - Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan. We made up stories about you. Legends. The other boys' stories were just that. But when I saw you I knew who you really were...

135) 3) dialog: Head over heels. Pressing charges, though. Blake lays a police file down with a thump. You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.
135) 6) dialog: You have an appetite. Why run? You can't hide from us with this record.
135) 8) dialog: Who then? Bane? What do you know about him?
