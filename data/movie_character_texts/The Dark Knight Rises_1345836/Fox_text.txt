53) 4) dialog: I'll pass along your request. Next time I see him. Miranda catches something in this.
53) 6) dialog: Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has his...eccentricities.
53) 11) dialog: I was not. But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.
53) 13) dialog: Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.
53) 15) dialog: What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne?
53) 17) dialog: Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive. 35.
53) 21) dialog: A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in.
53) 23) dialog: If you're not willing to turn your machine on -
53) 26) dialog: Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way. She's smart, and quite lovely.
53) 28) dialog: We all just want what's best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine.
53) 31) dialog: Anything else?
53) 34) dialog: These conversations always used to end with some...unusual requests.

54) 0) text: Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations...
54) 2) dialog: It was always shut down, officially.
54) 4) dialog: After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof.
54) 7) dialog: Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them... Wayne shakes his head.
54) 8) dialog: Sure I can't tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg.
54) 11) dialog: Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk... Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's ey light up. 37.
54) 15) dialog: Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation.
54) 18) dialog: It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black. Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.
54) 20) dialog: Works great except for the autopilot.
54) 22) dialog: Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it.
54) 25) dialog: I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.

104) 9) dialog: It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.
104) 10) dialog: Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you're completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.
104) 12) dialog: Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story.
104) 14) dialog: We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get dressed. 70.
105) 3) dialog: Bear with me, Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.
106) 0) text: Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at h
106) 1) dialog: Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shock as the office becomes an elevator into -
107) 3) dialog: The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.
107) 6) dialog: I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one. Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.
107) 37) dialog: We have a board meeting to get to.
108) 12) dialog: I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.
108) 17) dialog: Right away.

147) 6) dialog: I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.
226) 8) dialog: Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation.
226) 15) dialog: It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor. 123.
226) 19) dialog: As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable...until the point of detonation.
226) 22) dialog: And it will go off. In twenty-three days. Captain Jones reels at this news.
226) 26) dialog: I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.
228) 4) dialog: Take Miranda - Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenari jump out of the elevator, firing high.
236) 0) text: A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders, industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It Stryver, Daggett's functionary.
243) 8) dialog: You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.
243) 11) dialog: That bomb goes off in twelve hours.
243) 13) dialog: If you can get it there. I'll find a way to plug it back in. (Indicates Miranda.) Can you get Miranda out? 136.

245) 0) text: Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker. 137.
245) 4) dialog: They can't be using radio or cell - too much interference. Infrared doesn't have the range. It could only be micro-burst long wave... Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment: mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...
245) 6) dialog: Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked? Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...

248) 3) dialog: Autopilot? That's what you're there for.
296) 0) text: Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces a wave smashes into him, painfully... 155.
