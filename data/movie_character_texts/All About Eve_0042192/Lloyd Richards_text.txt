Going out just as Karen's taxi pulls is: MARGO CHANNING in 'AGED IN WOOD'. The marquis display below includes "Max Fabian Presents" and "By Lloyd Richar The taxi comes to a stop at the alley. Karen can be seen through the closed windows telling the driver to wait. Th she gets out. She takes a step, hesitates, then looks abo curiously:
6) 0) text: It is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and cracked plaster. It is furnished in beat-up wicker. A doo leads to an old-fashioned bathroom.  Margo is at the dressing table. She wears an old wrapper, hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies before her like a dead poodle. Also before her is an almo finished drink.  LLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise. He' his late thirties, sensitive, literate.  Between them, by the dressing table, is BIRDIE - Margo's maid. Her age is unimportant. She was conceived during a split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot. Sh fiercely loyal to Margo.  Karen enters during the line Margo started while she was outside. Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles. 
6) 3) dialog: How was the concert?
6) 7) dialog: Margo's interview with a lady reporter from the South-
6) 12) dialog: That was way back...
6) 23) dialog: - 'at's my loyal little woman. 
6) 25) dialog: Easy, now...
6) 38) dialog: That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
6) 48) dialog: (nicely) Hello, Miss Harrington. 
6) 53) dialog: (to Birdie) Oh brother what? 
6) 64) dialog: (delighted) Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it? 
6) 67) dialog: (flatly) I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
6) 70) dialog: How'd hear about it?
6) 72) dialog: Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  (Eve nods) Why? I'm curious... Eve looks at Margo, then drops her eyes. 
6) 76) dialog: But you must have friends, a family, a home- Eve pauses. Then shakes her head. 
6) 82) dialog: 'Remembrance'.
6) 90) dialog: Not at all...
6) 132) dialog: I'm not worried about you. 
6) 138) dialog: It's been a real pleasure, Eve. 
20) 37) dialog: How about calling it a night?
20) 47) dialog: Now let's not get into a big hassle-
20) 57) dialog: Coming?
20) 65) dialog: Max is going to drop us...
25) 46) dialog: I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
25) 51) dialog: You've got Margo mixed up with a five-and-ten-cent store...
25) 61) dialog: The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen? 
26) 50) dialog: There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
26) 52) dialog: Up in the room. 
26) 55) dialog: Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood. 
26) 58) dialog: Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
26) 60) dialog: I will.  Another pause. 
26) 62) dialog: The play? All right, I guess...
26) 64) dialog: Twentyish. It isn't important. 
26) 66) dialog: How do you mean? 
26) 68) dialog: Margo, you haven't got any age. 
26) 70) dialog: I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
26) 72) dialog: Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
26) 74) dialog: Just one person. Isn't that so? (Margo doesn't answer) You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.  A pause. Margo closes the box of bicarb. 
29) 0) text: The curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a deteriorating Southern mansion.  There is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the ais about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the stage. She is seated; they stand between her and auditori There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot make out. Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignore him as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears throug the door which leads backstage.  Max whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and put his hands to his head in despair.  Margo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd tur her. Eve rises. 
29) 8) dialog: She's your understudy.
29) 10) dialog: I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
29) 20) dialog: Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
29) 23) dialog: You'd have been proud of her.
29) 25) dialog: She was a revelation...
29) 27) dialog: What do you mean?
29) 29) dialog: That's beside the point. 
29) 33) dialog: You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
29) 35) dialog: You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
29) 37) dialog: You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most! 
29) 39) dialog: I never said it was!
29) 42) dialog: No! (to Margo) What makes you think that either Miller or Sherwood would stand for the nonsense I take from you - you'd better stick to Beaumont and Fletcher! They've been dead for three hundred years!  He stalks into the wings. Bill's reaction to the fight is typical. He lights a cigarette, stretches out on the cove bed. Eve stands frozen with fear. Margo yells after Lloyd into the wings. 
29) 44) dialog: That would solve none of their problems - because actresses never die! The stars never die and never change! He starts up the aisle with Max. 
29) 54) dialog: (from the top of the aisle) I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing? 
29) 56) dialog: It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto! Max has already walked out unhappily. Lloyd now slams out Margo glares after him, then turns to Bill who smokes his cigarette peacefully on the bed. 
30) 3) dialog: Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
30) 5) dialog: And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
30) 7) dialog: Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
30) 9) dialog: Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-! (suddenly softening) Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
30) 11) dialog: - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
30) 13) dialog: Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?  He starts up the stairs to the bedroom. 
30) 15) dialog: (pauses) What is?
30) 17) dialog: Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking... (continues up stairs) ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects... As he goes into one of the bedrooms, Karen sits thoughtfu on a couch. She muses...
31) 0) text: Open country. Preferably no houses in sight. Plenty of sn Lloyd's car drives along. 
32) 0) text: Lloyd driving. All three in the front seat. 
32) 2) dialog: When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
32) 4) dialog: Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
32) 9) dialog: Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass. 
32) 11) dialog: I have no intention of having an accident!
32) 13) dialog: Now what's this...? He tries to start it again. No luck. He turns on the dashboard lights. The gas gauge reads empty. 
32) 14) dialog: But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday! (to Karen) Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
32) 16) dialog: Incredible.  Futilely, he runs the started again. 
32) 24) dialog: Well. No sense my just sitting here. I'm going to walk up about half a mile, just in case. He starts out of the car. The cold comes in like a knife, women react. 
32) 26) dialog: (grins) What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
32) 29) dialog: The audience will want its money refunded, believe me. 
39) 0) text: Karen's having some lunch. Lloyd, still in his robe, sits opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette. A copy o the interview before him. 
39) 1) dialog: (is saying) - it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
39) 3) dialog: (put out his cigarette) Eve. 
39) 5) dialog: She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
39) 7) dialog: (gets up) She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
39) 9) dialog: She started to tell me all about it - and she couldn't finish, she cried so... He's over by a window, his back to her. Karen eyes him curiously, waiting for the payoff...
39) 10) dialog: (finally) You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
39) 12) dialog: (walks again) What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
39) 14) dialog: If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
39) 16) dialog: If we could cast it properly, that is...
39) 18) dialog: (smiles) You've got to admit it would be a novelty. 
39) 20) dialog: Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
39) 22) dialog: No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
39) 24) dialog: (wistfully) For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise- Now Karen explodes. She rises.
39) 26) dialog: Now just a minute-
39) 28) dialog: (angry) Now just a minute!
39) 30) dialog: All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she? 
39) 32) dialog: That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
39) 34) dialog: Hello! (he quiets down) ... hi, Margo... no, not at all, Karen and I were just chatting... hmm?... why - why, yes, I'm sure we can and I'm sure we'd love to... right... 11:45ish. See you then... He hangs up. He smiles - suddenly, there's peace.
39) 35) dialog: Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine. 
39) 37) dialog: I'm glad Bill's back. 
39) 39) dialog: Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
39) 41) dialog: (grins) You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.  Karen smiles happily.
40) 0) text: Margo, Karen, Bill and Lloyd are ensconced happily at a t in the rear of the room. A bottle of fine wine is being poured. Their mood is equally bubbly. 
40) 6) dialog: It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice. 
40) 9) dialog: For some reason you can't just pick up champagne and drink it. Somebody's got to be very witty about a toast.         (he lifts his glass) For instance...
40) 13) dialog: Well of all-
40) 19) dialog: City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
40) 22) dialog: Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
40) 26) dialog: There are very few moments in life as good as this. Let's remember it. (he lifts his glass) To each of us and all of us... never have we been more close - may we never be farther apart. They drink. A waiter approaches with a note. 
40) 30) dialog: Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
40) 39) dialog: (to Karen) After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
40) 42) dialog: Go on - find out...
42) 17) dialog: - well? What happened?
42) 24) dialog: You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say? 
42) 33) dialog: You know, she probably means well, after all...
42) 47) dialog: (smiles) That depends. 
42) 49) dialog: I don't think I could be.
42) 53) dialog: What's your being married got to do with it? 
42) 55) dialog: What's so funny?
43) 0) text: Karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box. Lloyd beside Max up front. On stage, the play is "on its feet." Eve plays a dramatic scene with a young man. They carry "sides" but do not con them. As she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium.  Bill calls a halt. He indicates to Eve that she was to ha remained downstage.  Eve seems to be at a loss. She looks at Lloyd.  Lloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change.  Bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to writing, he'll do the directing. It mounts swiftly to a screaming fight. Bill throws the script out into the auditorium, takes his coat and stalks off. Eve runs after him. Max retrieves the script. Lloyd remai adamant. Karen has risen in dismay.  Eve drags Bill back. Without looking at Lloyd, he takes t script from Max, tells the actors to pick up where they l off.  Eve whispers to Lloyd from the stage. Lloyd smiles, mollified, sits down again with Max.  Karen walks up the side aisle, out of the theater...
44) 0) text: It is a lovely, large room. Two double beds, not alongsid each other and each with an extension phone beside it. In addition to the door to the living room, there are two mo to separate dressing rooms and baths. Lloyd is asleep. Bu not Karen. She turns restlessly, finally sits up, lights cigarette. 
45) 2) dialog: Who is it? What's it all about?
45) 7) dialog: (into phone) Hello...hello, this is Lloyd Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk to her-
45) 11) dialog: Tell her not to worry - tell her I'll be right over. 
45) 17) dialog: I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
45) 19) dialog: (goes right on) - and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater! He goes back into his room. 
45) 21) dialog: Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
46) 0) text: The theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented Max Fabian, opening tonight.  Addison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her pho on a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. 
50) 13) dialog: For services rendered - beyond the whatever-it-is-of-duty, darling. Max bustles into the SHOT.
