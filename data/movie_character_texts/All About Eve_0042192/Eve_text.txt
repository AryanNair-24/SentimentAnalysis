3) 15) dialog: Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.  Karen contemplates Eve. Then she takes her arm. 
3) 17) dialog: (hanging back) Oh, no...
3) 19) dialog: No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan... Karen practically propels her toward the stage door.

6) 63) dialog: (to Margo) No, thank you. (to Lloyd) Yes. I've seen every performance. 
6) 65) dialog: I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
6) 68) dialog: Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
6) 71) dialog: There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
6) 73) dialog: Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go. 
6) 75) dialog: Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
6) 78) dialog: If I only knew how...
6) 80) dialog: Well... Birdie comes out of the bathroom. Everybody looks at her sharply. She realizes she's in on something important. Sh closes the door quietly, leans against it.
6) 81) dialog: Well... it started with the play before this one...
6) 84) dialog: San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East. 
6) 87) dialog: It couldn't possibly interest you. 
6) 89) dialog: I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I? 
6) 91) dialog: Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery. (she smiles) When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards? (Lloyd nods) That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  (a slight pause) Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead... (Karen puts her hand on Lloyd's) ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am... She finishes dry-eyes and self-composed. Margo squeezes t bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes.

7) 9) dialog: I just wondered.
7) 11) dialog: Why.
7) 13) dialog: Why you have to go out there.
7) 15) dialog: Is it the money?
7) 17) dialog: Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
7) 19) dialog: I just asked a simple question.

17) 21) dialog: (scoffs) I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?

19) 11) dialog: Karen... (she picks at the coverlet) ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done. 
19) 13) dialog: Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...  She looks down at the coverlet once more. 
19) 15) dialog: I don't let myself think about it, even-  (she looks up, rises as she speaks) - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl- (suddenly afraid, she sits) - but suppose I had to go on one night?

To know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you... they smile, their eyes shine - you've pleased them, they want you, you belong. Just that alone is worth anything... She becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's l of warm interest. She's embarrassed, she turns away - the scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from direction of the pantry.

29) 16) dialog: ... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-

35) 16) dialog: Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room. 
35) 18) dialog: When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-

35) 22) dialog: You think?
35) 24) dialog: You hear all kinds of things. 
35) 26) dialog: Find out. 
35) 30) dialog: Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
35) 32) dialog: I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.  She starts creaming her face, removing make-up.
35) 34) dialog: You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
35) 36) dialog: It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself. 
35) 38) dialog: Please do.
35) 40) dialog: I don't think I've done anything to sound off about. 
35) 42) dialog: Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow. 
35) 44) dialog: Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.

41) 10) dialog: Why shouldn't you? (a pause) Please sit down.  Karen sits, reluctantly and rigidly.
41) 11) dialog: You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt. (another pause) I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
41) 13) dialog: (nods) In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
41) 15) dialog: No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace. 
41) 17) dialog: (smiles grimly) You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be... She turns away from Karen. Karen's embarrassed. 
41) 19) dialog: (turned away) I'm not crying.
41) 21) dialog: Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
41) 23) dialog: - an understudy's performance. 
41) 25) dialog: He's not my friend. You were my friends...
41) 27) dialog: I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.  This time she does cry. Softly, miserably. Karen looks ab A pause. She puts an arm around Eve. 
41) 29) dialog: I'll never get over it. 
41) 31) dialog: I wish I could believe that. 
41) 33) dialog: There is something.  Karen stares down at her. Eve's eyes burn into tears. Kar is caught, fascinated by them. 
41) 35) dialog: Something most important you can do. 
41) 37) dialog: If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would. 
41) 39) dialog: It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now. 
41) 41) dialog: "Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me. 
41) 43) dialog: Addison wants me to play it. 
41) 45) dialog: (cold, relentless) That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town... (Karen stops struggling) ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him... (she smiles, now) ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  (Karen sits) If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last... (Karen covers her face with her hands) Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again? (now Eve gets up) No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too... Karen looks up slowly.
41) 47) dialog: (smiles) I'd do much more - for a part that good. She leaves. Karen is alone.

42) 8) dialog: Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.    Addison puffs at his cigarette, bemused. 
42) 10) dialog: Just like that. 
42) 12) dialog: I don't think that's funny. 
42) 14) dialog: I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...

They carry "sides" but do not con them. As she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium.  Bill calls a halt. He indicates to Eve that she was to ha remained downstage.  Eve seems to be at a loss. She looks at Lloyd.  Lloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change.  Bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to writing, he'll do the directing. It mounts swiftly to a screaming fight. Bill throws the script out into the auditorium, takes his coat and stalks off. Eve runs after him. Max retrieves the script. Lloyd remai adamant. Karen has risen in dismay.  Eve drags Bill back.

46) 4) dialog: Just like it. 
46) 6) dialog: (grins) Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
46) 8) dialog: Aren't you?
46) 10) dialog: It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
46) 12) dialog: You know me better than that. 
46) 14) dialog: Stars. She goes in. Addison follows her.

48) 20) dialog: I'm in love with Lloyd!
48) 22) dialog: You have no right to say such things!
48) 24) dialog: Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great! (as she sits) You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...

He never went home...
48) 34) dialog: (meaningly) We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract. 
48) 36) dialog: (happily) Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve! Addison rises slowly, to his full height. As Eve watches as her eyes go up to his, her smile fades-

48) 48) dialog: Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
48) 50) dialog: What do you mean by that?
48) 52) dialog: What have you got to do with it?
48) 54) dialog: I can't believe my ears...
48) 56) dialog: Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
48) 58) dialog: ... taken it for granted? That you and I... She smiles. Then she chuckles, then laughs. A mistake. Addison slaps her sharply across the face.

48) 62) dialog: Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out. She goes to the phone.

50) 2) dialog: Honored members of Sarah Siddons Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: What is there for me to say? Everything wise and witty has long since been said - by minds more mature and talents far greater than mine. For me to thank you as equals would be presumptuous - I am an apprentice in the Theater and have much to learn from you all. I can say only that I am proud and happy and that I regard this great honor not so much as an award for what I have achieved, but as a standard to hold against what I have yet to accomplish. (applause) And further, I regard it as bestowed upon me only in part. The larger share belongs to my friends in the Theater - and to the Theater itself, which has given me all I have. In good conscience, I must give credit where credit is due. To Max Fabian- MAX sits erect, beaming proudly.

50) 11) dialog: Although I am going to Hollywood next week to make a film - do not think for a moment that I am leaving you. How could I? For my heart is here in the Theater - and three thousand miles are too far to be away from one's heart. I'll be back to claim it - and soon. That is, if you want me back. Another storm of applause. Much ad lib shouting as Bill a Lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures. People are thronging out. The Aged Actor shouts above the hubbub...
50) 16) dialog: Thank you, Karen. Karen goes. Eve is being constantly congratulated. Some a lib about seeing her at Max's party...
50) 20) dialog: I don't suppose there's a drink left...
50) 22) dialog: (sits) I don't think I'm going. 
50) 24) dialog: Because I don't want to.
