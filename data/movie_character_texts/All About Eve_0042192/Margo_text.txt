28) 1) dialog: Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
28) 3) dialog: The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
28) 5) dialog: It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts. She heads for the auditorium.
28) 7) dialog: (stops) Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max. 
28) 9) dialog: (lightly) Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill? (he shakes his head) Lloyd? (he shakes his head) Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
28) 11) dialog: I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
28) 13) dialog: Eve! My understudy...
28) 15) dialog: (quickly) Of course I knew. 
28) 17) dialog: How... how was Miss Caswell?
28) 19) dialog: Just slipped your mind. 
28) 21) dialog: Was she that bad? As Addison speaks, he rises with excitement.
28) 23) dialog: (flatly) I take it she read well.
28) 25) dialog: How nice. 
28) 27) dialog: A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
28) 29) dialog: How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody. Addison, of course, knows exactly what she's doing. He se the approaching typhoon, he whips it up...
28) 31) dialog: The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
29) 0) text: The curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a deteriorating Southern mansion.  There is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the ais about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the stage. She is seated; they stand between her and auditori There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot make out. Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignore him as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears throug the door which leads backstage.  Max whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and put his hands to his head in despair.  Margo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd tur her. Eve rises. 
29) 1) dialog: (cheerily) Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
29) 3) dialog: How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office? (over the footlights to Max) I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too... Max slumps in his seat. By the time Margo turns back to t the others have exchanged swift looks. 
29) 5) dialog: What's all over?
29) 7) dialog: (pleased astonishment) Eve? (she turns to her) How enchanting... (to Lloyd and Bill) Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
29) 9) dialog: Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
29) 11) dialog: It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all- (out to Max again) - Max you sly puss. Max submerges further in his seat. 
29) 13) dialog: Really, Eve? Why?
29) 15) dialog: Why not?
29) 17) dialog: (murmurs) What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
29) 19) dialog: You wouldn't understand.  (to Lloyd) How was Miss Caswell?
29) 22) dialog: I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do. (to Lloyd) You were about to tell me about Eve...
29) 24) dialog: I'm sure. 
29) 26) dialog: To you, too?
29) 28) dialog: (the ice begins to form) I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
29) 30) dialog: It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
29) 32) dialog: So full of meaning, fire and music!
29) 34) dialog: - in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
29) 36) dialog: Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
29) 38) dialog: Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
29) 40) dialog: Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?  Max has edged his way to the stage. 
29) 43) dialog: And they're getting better performances today than they ever got! All playwrights should be dead for three hundred years! Lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium. Th battle goes on without a pause. As he yells back, he cros to Max at row A, center. 
29) 45) dialog: You can change this star any time you want! For a new, fresh, exciting one fully equipped with fire and music! Any time you want - starting with tonight's performance! Now it's Max who stops and shouts back at her.
29) 47) dialog: (from the stage) Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
29) 49) dialog: Answer my question!
29) 51) dialog: I didn't hear you. 
29) 53) dialog: Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
29) 55) dialog: Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
29) 57) dialog: (quiet menace) And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  (Bill waves his cigarette; he's noncommittal) Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
29) 59) dialog: The kid. Junior. 
29) 61) dialog: I must have frightened her away. 
29) 63) dialog: (paces up and down) Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
29) 65) dialog: I mix what I like. 
29) 67) dialog: I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind. 
29) 69) dialog: The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
29) 71) dialog: I will not calm down!
29) 73) dialog: You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
29) 75) dialog: Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
29) 77) dialog: Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
29) 79) dialog: (going right on) - shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
29) 81) dialog: The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
29) 83) dialog: Paranoiac!
29) 85) dialog: Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it... She turns away. Bill grabs her, pulls her down on the bed holds her down. 
29) 87) dialog: (struggling) That word again! I don't even know what it means...
29) 89) dialog: It's obvious you're not a woman.
29) 91) dialog: Well, I am. 
29) 93) dialog: Don't be condescending. 
29) 95) dialog: (with dignity) I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
29) 97) dialog: The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender. 
29) 99) dialog: It's not nonsense. 
29) 101) dialog: I wish it were. 
29) 103) dialog: I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something. 
29) 105) dialog: I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
29) 107) dialog: Bill... (he stops) ... where are you going? To find Eve? 
32) 5) dialog: That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
32) 7) dialog: Peace and quit is for libraries.  The car swerves - suddenly and slightly. 
32) 10) dialog: Karen and I just don't want an accident-
32) 12) dialog: It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.  They all laugh. Suddenly the car slows and stops - with t hissing sound that can mean only one thing - no gas. 
32) 17) dialog: (crisply) How much time have we? 
32) 19) dialog: How far to the station?
32) 21) dialog: Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
32) 23) dialog: Not many car either, not much chance of a lift... A moment of silence. 
32) 28) dialog: (quietly) How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on. 
32) 30) dialog: Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.  Lloyd starts down the road. He slips once, recovers, wave and keeps going. 
32) 32) dialog: It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous. 
32) 34) dialog: Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.  They tuck the fur car robe around them. A pause. Margo tu on the radio... it's "Liebestraum."
32) 35) dialog: Do you want it on?
32) 37) dialog: I detest cheap sentiment.  She turns it off. Another pause. 
32) 38) dialog: Karen. (Karen says "hm?") I haven't been pleasant this weekend. 
32) 40) dialog: Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
32) 42) dialog: So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
32) 44) dialog: And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.    There's a pause. 
32) 46) dialog: What about Bill?
32) 48) dialog: More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he? 
32) 50) dialog: Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
32) 52) dialog: Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often. 
32) 54) dialog: Isn't that what they always say?  She turns the radio on again. A piano nocturne...
32) 55) dialog: I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
32) 57) dialog: About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too. 
32) 59) dialog: Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...         (she smiles at Karen) ... slow curtain. The end.  A pause. There are tears in Karen's eyes. 
32) 61) dialog: About what? 
32) 63) dialog: Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank... She snuggles down into her furs. Karen flashes an unhappy look at her. She, too, snuggles down...
34) 0) text: More activity than last time, the performance being just over. Addison comes through the door, picks his way towar Margo's dressing room. 
35) 0) text: Bill faces Eve, who wears Margo's costume. She is a ravis sight. Her eyes shine up to his radiantly:
38) 0) text: Addison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides a reading it. Karen sits miserably. 
38) 1) dialog: (declaiming) "... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  (she skips part of the column) Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
38) 3) dialog: It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
38) 5) dialog: (pacing) In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  (she hurls the paper away) ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
38) 7) dialog: The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat... She pauses in midair to look at... Bill. He has come up t stairs tow at a time, stands at the landing. 
40) 0) text: Margo, Karen, Bill and Lloyd are ensconced happily at a t in the rear of the room. A bottle of fine wine is being poured. Their mood is equally bubbly. 
40) 2) dialog: Hear, hear...
40) 4) dialog: He does not exaggerate. I was good. 
40) 7) dialog: (eyes still on Bill) Too bad. 
40) 12) dialog: Glory Hallelujah.
40) 18) dialog: Yes, sir. 
40) 21) dialog: I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all. 
40) 24) dialog: Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
40) 31) dialog: Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
40) 33) dialog: (reading) "Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."

40) 36) dialog: Encore du champagne.
40) 38) dialog: That's what I said, bub.
40) 43) dialog: Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
42) 19) dialog: With tears?
42) 21) dialog: But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
42) 23) dialog: Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
42) 26) dialog: Groom- (Bill says "huh?") - may I have a wedding present? 
42) 28) dialog: I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine... (blissfully) ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.   They all look.  ADDISON AND EVE, they get up and go without looking back. GROUP, they watch for an instant. 
42) 29) dialog: There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
42) 31) dialog: You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her... Karen's reactions are, of course, most important. Knowing what she's done to Margo - wondering how to do what she m
42) 32) dialog: ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too. 
42) 34) dialog: She is a louse. 
42) 36) dialog: Groom.
42) 38) dialog: You know what I'm going to be?
42) 40) dialog: A married lady. 
42) 42) dialog: I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen? 
42) 44) dialog: (to Bill) You'll be there, won't you. 
42) 46) dialog: A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd. (Lloyd nods) I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...         (they all smile) Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me? 
42) 48) dialog: I mean really, deeply angry...
42) 50) dialog: Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
42) 52) dialog: (hastily) Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
42) 54) dialog: It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights! (then quietly) I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd? Lloyd never gets to answer. Because Karen, before anyone stop her, bursts into hysterical laughter...
50) 19) dialog: ... nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry too much about your heart. You can always put that award where your heart ought to be.  Eve looks at her wordlessly. Margo and Bill leave. Addiso and Eve are alone. The tables about them are empty. Sudde her face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull... she gla at the table.
