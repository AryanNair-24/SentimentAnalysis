1) 0) text: It is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for four but some for six and eight. A long table of honor, f about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais.  Diner is over. Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy. The overal effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. It i June. The CAMERA, as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES, on the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD. It is a gold statuette, about foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse. Exquisite framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature alta the center of the table of honor.  Over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of ADDISON deWITT:
20) 0) text: Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addis a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protege the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison... Eve They are all seated on the steps. Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floo Karen remains with the others.  Addison is holding forth:
20) 1) dialog: Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
20) 7) dialog: It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
20) 10) dialog: These so-called abnormalities - they're our stock in trade, they make us actors, writers, directors, et cetera in the first place-
20) 12) dialog: What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
20) 14) dialog: We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
20) 16) dialog: That happens to be your particular abnormality. 
20) 19) dialog: That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler. 
20) 21) dialog: You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point. 
20) 25) dialog: Well done. I see your career rising in the East like the sun... (to Bill) ... you were saying?
20) 36) dialog: You're maudlin and full of self pity. You're magnificent.  Max has come up with Miss Caswell's drink. 
20) 46) dialog: Hear, hear...
20) 56) dialog: Too bad! We'll miss the third act. They're going to play it off stage.  Eve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears. 
20) 66) dialog: I've often wondered, Max, why you bother with a chauffeur and limousine in New York City.
20) 68) dialog: And too many of them are produced. 
20) 70) dialog: You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano. (to Eve) And you come sit by me. (to the others) Good night.  They laugh, say "good night," and start downstairs. As Ev crosses to Addison:
25) 70) dialog: Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
25) 73) dialog: Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  (his glance is attracted by Eve coming downstairs) Ah... Eve.
25) 76) dialog: This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
25) 79) dialog: (murmurs) It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
25) 81) dialog: We have that in common. 
25) 85) dialog: (icily) Claudia dear, come closer. (she does, and he points) This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good. 
25) 87) dialog: Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.  Miss Caswell drapes her coat over the rail, heads for Max Addison puts Eve's arm in his. 
25) 88) dialog: (to Margo) You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands. 
28) 0) text: Margo comes from the street through the lobby ( a few peo buying tickets) and into the deserted foyer. She spots Addison sprawled on one of the sofas. 
28) 2) dialog: Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
28) 4) dialog: Being violently ill to her tummy. 
28) 6) dialog: Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over. 
28) 8) dialog: The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four. 
28) 10) dialog: Naturally enough, your understudy. 
28) 12) dialog: I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington. 
28) 14) dialog: (keenly) Didn't you know?
28) 16) dialog: It just slipped your mind.  A moment of silence. 
28) 18) dialog: Frankly, I don't remember.
28) 20) dialog: Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
28) 22) dialog: Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
28) 24) dialog: It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
28) 26) dialog: In time she'll be what you are. 
28) 28) dialog: Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
28) 30) dialog: Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them. 
28) 32) dialog: To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.  Miss Caswell appears, uncertain, in the b.g.
28) 33) dialog: Feeling better, my dear?
28) 35) dialog: You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.  Margo, abruptly, starts for the auditorium. Addison smile He takes Miss Caswell's arm. 
28) 37) dialog: That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.  He takes her toward the street. 
33) 0) text: The snow has been shoveled to either side of the alley, making a lane. The performance is just over.  Addison, his back to us, stands looking toward the stage door. A few actors, on their way out. 
34) 0) text: More activity than last time, the performance being just over. Addison comes through the door, picks his way towar Margo's dressing room. 
35) 29) dialog: May I come in?
35) 31) dialog: (entering) I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
35) 33) dialog: Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
35) 35) dialog: You're more than modest.
35) 37) dialog: A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
35) 39) dialog: I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly... 
35) 41) dialog: We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
35) 43) dialog: It needn't be. 
35) 45) dialog: I am somebody.  Eve rises. She eyes him steadily. 
35) 47) dialog: Leave the door open a bit, so we can talk.  Eve does so. 
35) 48) dialog: After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
35) 50) dialog: (smiling) Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
35) 52) dialog: - perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  (no answer; Addison smiles) I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
35) 54) dialog: San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco? 
35) 56) dialog: And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
35) 58) dialog: (grins happily) A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name? 
35) 60) dialog: Eddie what? Eve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door. 
35) 62) dialog: I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
35) 64) dialog: I believe I will. She closes the door. He leans back, lights a cigarette. 
37) 5) dialog: She was magnificent. 
37) 7) dialog: I was there. An eyewitness.
37) 9) dialog: (smiles) A happy coincidence.
37) 13) dialog: They'll be wasting this much of their time at any rate. Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood.  He turns to Karen, changing the subject. 
37) 14) dialog: From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
37) 16) dialog: Margo? Lunching in public?
37) 18) dialog: She may be later than you think... As he speaks, he crosses to pick up an evening paper, ope it as he comes back. 
37) 19) dialog: (handing it to her) Why not read my column to pass the time? The minutes will fly like hours... (he takes Eve's arm) ... and now we must join our sunburned eager beaver.  He goes up the stairs with Eve. Karen glances after them curiously, then at the column. It is headed: "Things I Promised Not To Tell" by Addison deWitt. He expression becomes increasingly horrified. She drops the paper and rushes out...
38) 0) text: Addison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides a reading it. Karen sits miserably. 
40) 45) dialog: Karen! How nice... She walks past him without a word. He smiles, looks towar the group. He raises his glass in a toast.  Margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a gra flourish, then eating it. 
42) 0) text: Eve enters and slides in beside Addison. 
42) 1) dialog: Hungry?
42) 3) dialog: (pours) I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
42) 5) dialog: Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it. 
42) 7) dialog: She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
42) 9) dialog: Just like that, eh?
42) 11) dialog: (thoughtfully) Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.  Eve's feelings are hurt. 
42) 13) dialog: It wasn't meant to be. 
42) 15) dialog: (breaks in) I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.  Their eyes meet. 
42) 16) dialog: We have a great deal in common, it seems to me... They both look as Karen passes them on her way back to he table.  GROUP, as Karen joins them. Another bottle of champagne h come and almost gone - there's a fine, cheery feeling amo them. Margo, in particular, is cheery. A pause. Karen dow glass of champagne.
46) 0) text: The theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented Max Fabian, opening tonight.  Addison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her pho on a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. 
46) 3) dialog: D-day.
46) 5) dialog: And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
46) 7) dialog: Are you that sure of tomorrow?
46) 9) dialog: Frankly - yes. They've arrived in front of the hotel. 
46) 11) dialog: All paved with diamonds and gold?
46) 13) dialog: Paved with what, then?
47) 0) text: Addison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door.
47) 2) dialog: Almost four.
47) 4) dialog: You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
47) 6) dialog: The mark of a true killer. (he holds out his hand) Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
47) 8) dialog: Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.  He turns to go. After a few steps-
48) 0) text: Old-fashioned, dreary and small. The action starts in the living room and continues to the bedroom.  Addison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair. 
48) 1) dialog: Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant? 
48) 3) dialog: Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian. 
48) 5) dialog: Some plain soda. (Eve starts to fix it) Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
48) 7) dialog: We're?
48) 9) dialog: I find it odd that Karen isn't here for the opening, don't you? He sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look Eve. As he looks back-
48) 11) dialog: (blandly) She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
48) 13) dialog: (nods) - something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
48) 15) dialog: What else? Eve gets up, crosses to look out over the Common.
48) 17) dialog: So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
48) 19) dialog: I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
48) 21) dialog: Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
48) 23) dialog: - and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison. Eve drops her shocked manner like a cape. Her face lights she crosses back to the ottoman. 
48) 25) dialog: ... and Karen.
48) 29) dialog: (thoughtfully) I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
48) 31) dialog: (increasingly tense) Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
48) 33) dialog: You sat and talked until it was light...
48) 35) dialog: (quietly) There never was, there'll never be another like you. 
48) 37) dialog: What do you take me for?
48) 39) dialog: (moving away) It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
48) 41) dialog: Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
48) 43) dialog: Yes, you did. You still do.  Eve gets up, now. 
48) 45) dialog: (breaks in) - it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
48) 47) dialog: Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class. 
48) 49) dialog: Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say. (they are now facing each other) Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you. 
48) 51) dialog: More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it. 
48) 53) dialog: Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me. 
48) 55) dialog: A dull cliche.
48) 57) dialog: So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
48) 59) dialog: (quietly) Remember as long as you live, never to laugh at me. At anything or anyone else - but never at me. Eve eyes him coldly, goes to the door, throws it open.
48) 61) dialog: You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
48) 63) dialog: Don't pick it up! Don't even put your hand on it... She doesn't. Her back is to him. Addison smiles. 
48) 64) dialog: Something told you to do as I say, didn't it? That instinct is worth millions, you can't buy it, cherish it, Eve. When that alarm goes off, go to your battle stations... He comes up behind her. Eve is tense and wary.
48) 65) dialog: Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
48) 67) dialog: It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
48) 69) dialog: A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
48) 71) dialog: But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it? Eve turns and runs into the bedroom, slamming the door. Addison opens it, follows close after her... he can be se in the bedroom, shouting at Eve who is offscene.
48) 72) dialog: That $500 brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
49) 2) dialog: Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town? Eve throws herself on the bed, face down, bursts in tears Addison, merciless, moves closer. 
49) 3) dialog: Fourth. There was no Eddie - no pilot - and you've never been married! That was not only a lie, but an insult to dead heroes and to the women who loved them... (Eve, sobbing, puts her hands over her ears; Addison, closer, pulls them away) ... Fifth. San Francisco has no Shubert Theater and North Shore, you've never been to San Francisco! That was a stupid lie, easy to expose, not worthy of you... Eve twists to look up at him, her eyes streaming.
49) 5) dialog: She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
49) 7) dialog: I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door! Eve turns face down again, sobbing miserably.
49) 8) dialog: You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
49) 10) dialog: I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned... (he lets go of her hands) ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night? Eve covers her face with her hands. 
49) 12) dialog: That I should want you at all suddenly strikes me as the height of improbability. But that, in itself, is probably the reason. You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am I. We have that in common. Also a contempt for humanity, an inability to love or be loved, insatiable ambition - and talent. We deserve each other. Are you listening to me? Eve lies listlessly now, her tear-stained cheek against t coverlet. She nods.
49) 13) dialog: Then say so. 
49) 15) dialog: And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
49) 17) dialog: Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight. He starts out. 
49) 19) dialog: (smiles) Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life. He goes out. The CAMERA REMAINS on Eve's forlorn, tear stained face. Her eyes close... she goes to sleep.
50) 18) dialog: As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.  Max hurries out. Margo and Bill step into the SHOT. Eve t from a well-wisher to face her. 
50) 21) dialog: You can have one at Max's. 
50) 23) dialog: (sighs) Why not?
50) 25) dialog: (patiently) Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you. 
50) 27) dialog: It's the same thing, isn't it?
50) 29) dialog: You're being childish. A well-wisher rushes up to Eve with an "Eve, darling, I'm happy!" Eve rises, thanks her graciously. Then she pulls wrap over her shoulder.
50) 31) dialog: (curtly) Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it... They exit from the room, now empty of everything but tabl waiters, and the usual banquet debris. 
51) 0) text: Eve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment hotel. She doesn't say good night to Addison, she enters hotel as the cab drives off. She hasn't the award with he
53) 34) dialog: Hello, there. Who are you?
53) 36) dialog: We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her? She holds it as if it were the Promised Land. Addison smi faintly. He knows the look. 
53) 37) dialog: How do you know my name?
53) 39) dialog: And what is your name?
53) 41) dialog: Phoebe?
53) 43) dialog: Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?  Phoebe lifts her eyes to him. 
53) 45) dialog: Then you must Miss Harrington how to get one. Miss Harrington knows all about it... Phoebe smiles shyly. Addison closes the door. Phoebe star down at the award for an instant.
