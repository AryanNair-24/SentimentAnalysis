7) 18) dialog: The Theatuh, the Theatuh- (he sits up) - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna? (he gets up) Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera.

16) 30) dialog: I get a party, don't I?
16) 32) dialog: (laughs) It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
16) 34) dialog: She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.

20) 9) dialog: (nods) He must be miserable, the life he lives out there-
20) 15) dialog: (laughs; to Eve) You don't have to read his column tomorrow - you just heard it. I don't agree, Addison...
20) 17) dialog: Oh, I admit there's a screwball element in the Theater. It sticks out, it's got spotlights on it and a brass band. But it isn't basic, it isn't standard - if it were, the Theater couldn't survive...
20) 26) dialog: I was saying that the Theater is nine-tenths hard work. Work done the hard way - by sweat, application and craftsmanship. I'll agree to this - that to be a good actor, actress, or anything else in the Theater, means wanting to be that more than anything else in the world...
20) 28) dialog: (goes on) It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little... Eve speaks almost unaware of what she says. She looks at one in particular, just off...
20) 32) dialog: (sharply) Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
20) 39) dialog: It's a good thought.

25) 2) dialog: You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder. 
25) 7) dialog: Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
25) 9) dialog: When I'm guest of honor?
25) 11) dialog: I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.

25) 15) dialog: It's a pretty rare quality these days. 
25) 17) dialog: So she seems. 
25) 19) dialog: I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
25) 21) dialog: (laughs) I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
25) 23) dialog: Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
25) 25) dialog: Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
25) 27) dialog: Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible! 
25) 29) dialog: For instance what?
25) 31) dialog: This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
25) 33) dialog: Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
25) 35) dialog: She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
25) 40) dialog: I'll get it. (he crosses to Eve) What'll you have?  Eve, involuntarily, looks to Margo.
25) 58) dialog: Nothing, really...
25) 60) dialog: (smiles) I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl... He hands Eve's drink to Karen. Max has wandered off. Othe guests are arriving. Margo gulps her drink, hands Bill th empty glass. He puts it on a passing tray. Margo takes a fresh one at the same time.

26) 12) dialog: (trying to kid her out of it) Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
26) 14) dialog: Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
26) 18) dialog: No heart to burn. 
29) 0) text: The curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a deteriorating Southern mansion.  There is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the ais about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the stage.

Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignore him as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears throug the door which leads backstage.  Max whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and put his hands to his head in despair.  Margo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd tur her. Eve rises.

29) 58) dialog: Who?

29) 80) dialog: You've been all through that with Lloyd-
29) 82) dialog: I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
29) 84) dialog: I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
29) 86) dialog: No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
29) 88) dialog: (firmly) It's time you found out. I love you. (Margo says "Ha!") I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-                 (Margo says "A body with a voice") - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress- (he waits; Margo says nothing) - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness- (Margo says "Except happiness") - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid- (Margo sneers "Kid!") - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!   Margo seems quiet. He gets up. She sits up. 
29) 90) dialog: I've been aware of that for some time. 
29) 92) dialog: I'll say. 
29) 94) dialog: Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink. 
29) 96) dialog: (laughs) Margo, let's make peace.
29) 98) dialog: Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
29) 100) dialog: But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  (Margo nods) Isn't that enough?
29) 102) dialog: Then what would be enough? (Margo doesn't answer) If we were married?
29) 104) dialog: You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
29) 106) dialog: I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  (Margo doesn't say) I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  (a pause) We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time. (he takes a breath) You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.  No word from her. He starts away. 
29) 108) dialog: (smiles grimly) That suddenly makes the whole thing believable. He goes out. Margo, alone, sit for a moment sadly. Then s begins to cry...
34) 2) dialog: (from within) ... you were better than all right, kid, you gave a performance, you rang a bell- Addison uses his cane to swing the door open farther, so both he and WE can see as well as hear.

35) 1) dialog: (continuing) - little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be. 
35) 3) dialog: I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
35) 5) dialog: - after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.

35) 9) dialog: What have I got to do with it?
35) 11) dialog: (lightly) The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  (he pats her shoulder) Good luck.  He starts out. Addison ducks. 
35) 13) dialog: (stops) From what would I be running?
35) 15) dialog: (curiously) I'm for it. 
35) 17) dialog: (smiles) When I told you what every young actress should know.
