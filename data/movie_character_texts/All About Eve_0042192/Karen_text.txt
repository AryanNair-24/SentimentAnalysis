Going out just as Karen's taxi pulls is: MARGO CHANNING in 'AGED IN WOOD'. The marquis display below includes "Max Fabian Presents" and "By Lloyd Richar The taxi comes to a stop at the alley. Karen can be seen through the closed windows telling the driver to wait. Th she gets out. She takes a step, hesitates, then looks abo curiously:
3) 0) text: Karen moves toward the stage door. She passes a recess in wall - perhaps an exit - about halfway. 
3) 2) dialog: So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
3) 4) dialog: Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
3) 6) dialog: Not at all. 
3) 8) dialog: (smiles) To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
3) 10) dialog: (grins) Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
3) 12) dialog: He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait? 
3) 14) dialog: (incredulous) You see the play? You've seen the play every performance? (Eve nods) But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive? 
3) 16) dialog: I'm going to take you to Margo...
3) 18) dialog: She's got to meet you-
3) 20) dialog: (insisting) There isn't another like you, there couldn't be- 
3) 22) dialog: You look just fine... (they're at the stage door) ... by the way. What's your name?
4) 0) text: Everything, including the doorman, looks fireproof.  Eve enters like a novitiate's first visit to the Vatican. Karen, with a "Good evening, Gus -" to the doorman, leads way toward Margo's stage dressing room. Eve, drinking in wonderment of all the surveys, lags behind. Karen waits f her to catch up... 
5) 0) text: No star on the closed door; the paint is peeling. A type written chit, thumbtacked, says MISS CHANNING. As Karen and Eve approach it, an uninhibited guffaw from Margo makes them pause. 
5) 1) dialog: (whispers) You wait a minute... (smiles) ... now don't run away- Eve smiles shakily. At the same moment:
6) 0) text: It is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and cracked plaster. It is furnished in beat-up wicker. A doo leads to an old-fashioned bathroom.  Margo is at the dressing table. She wears an old wrapper, hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies before her like a dead poodle. Also before her is an almo finished drink.  LLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise. He' his late thirties, sensitive, literate.  Between them, by the dressing table, is BIRDIE - Margo's maid. Her age is unimportant. She was conceived during a split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot. Sh fiercely loyal to Margo.  Karen enters during the line Margo started while she was outside. Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles. 
6) 1) dialog: Hi. (she goes to kiss Lloyd) Hello, darling-
6) 4) dialog: Loud.
6) 6) dialog: No thanks, Birdie.  Karen laughs with them. 
6) 19) dialog: (firmly) Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie. 
6) 22) dialog: I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
6) 24) dialog: The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
6) 27) dialog: (mollified) It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
6) 29) dialog: Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
6) 31) dialog: They're your fans, your audience-
6) 33) dialog: Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you. 
6) 35) dialog: (in a whisper) She's just outside the door. 
6) 37) dialog: You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
6) 39) dialog: If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
6) 43) dialog: Not at all.  (her arm through Eve's) Margo, this is Eve Harrington.  Margo changes swiftly into a first-lady-of-the-theater manner. 
6) 47) dialog: My husband...
6) 58) dialog: Harrington. 
6) 62) dialog: I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play... They start together, and stop in deference to each other. They're a little flustered. But not Eve. 
6) 77) dialog: Tell us about it - Eve... Eve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her "Eve Then away, again...
6) 79) dialog: Try...
6) 86) dialog: Eve... why don't you start at the beginning? 
6) 101) dialog: (conscious of Eve) Bill...
6) 103) dialog: (louder) Bill-
6) 107) dialog: (yells) Bill!
6) 109) dialog: This is Eve Harrington. Bill flashes a fleeting look at Eve. 
6) 114) dialog: You've already met. 
6) 116) dialog: Right here. A minute ago. 
6) 121) dialog: You're not going, are you?
6) 128) dialog: Lloyd, we've got to go- Lloyd gets up. Karen crosses to pound on the bathroom doo She yells - the shower is going...
6) 129) dialog: Margo, good night! I'll call you tomorrow! Margo's answer is lost in the shower noise. Karen crosses kiss Bill. She's joined by Lloyd. 
6) 130) dialog: Good luck, genius...
6) 134) dialog: Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
6) 136) dialog: Not just that way. As a friend...
18) 0) text: MARGO, reflectively twirling her highball glass. The appl continues. She lifts her glass to drink. Her glance meets Karen's. She raises the glass in a silent toast.    KAREN smiles wanly at Margo's toast. Then the smile fades she looks reflectively back to Eve...
19) 2) dialog: Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up... (Eve holds it up; Karen whistles) ... whose is it? 
19) 4) dialog: Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
19) 6) dialog: Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?  Eve melts into warmth. She beams, sits on the bed. Karen spun around on the dressing table stool. 
19) 8) dialog: (smiles) Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality... (she gets up, gets her coat) ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  (throws it over her shoulder) ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo... She starts out. 
19) 10) dialog: (pauses, smiles) Karen.
19) 12) dialog: (crosses to her) Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it? 
19) 14) dialog: ... you want to be Margo's new understudy. 
19) 16) dialog: (laughs) Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays. 
19) 18) dialog: No, dear. Margo must go on.  (she sits beside Eve) As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
19) 20) dialog: I think she would cheer. 
19) 22) dialog: They'll do as they're told. Eve smiles a little. A pause. 
19) 24) dialog: Of course. 
19) 26) dialog: I won't forget. 
19) 29) dialog: (pointing) But she just got here...
19) 31) dialog: What did you expect - live sables?
19) 33) dialog: Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
20) 0) text: Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addis a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protege the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison... Eve They are all seated on the steps. Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floo Karen remains with the others.  Addison is holding forth:
20) 34) dialog: Margo, really...
20) 41) dialog: As a nonprofessional, I think it's an excellent idea. Undramatic, but practical... As she speaks, she makes her way to Lloyd's side. 
20) 45) dialog: Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
20) 48) dialog: It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
20) 58) dialog: In a minute... She crosses to Eve, puts an arm around her. 
20) 59) dialog: You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
20) 61) dialog: The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't. 
20) 63) dialog: Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
20) 72) dialog: (smiles) No, Eve, I won't forget... She follows the men downstairs. CLOSE UP of an old engrav of Mrs. Siddons as 'The Tragic Muse' which hangs among ot theatrical mementos on the stair wall...
25) 44) dialog: Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
25) 48) dialog: Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
25) 56) dialog: This is the most ghoulish conversation... Bill brings two Martinis. He hands one to Margo. 
25) 64) dialog: (to Margo) We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?  Margo surveys them all. 
30) 0) text: One large room, a small foyer with a door to the corridor stair up one wall to a narrow balcony from which a couple bedroom open. Karen is painting. Earnestly but badly. A still life of a orange, an avocado, an eggplant and three bananas. 
30) 2) dialog: Lloyd, what happened...?
30) 4) dialog: Margo, again...
30) 6) dialog: That's on time for Margo. 
30) 8) dialog: It's just possible she didn't...
30) 10) dialog: - don't run out of adjectives, dear. 
30) 12) dialog: Margo hasn't done badly by it.
30) 14) dialog: (murmurs) It's going to be a cozy weekend.
30) 16) dialog: We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
30) 24) dialog: (into phone) Hello... will you call Miss Eve Harrington to the phone, please? Not at all... thank you.   And as she waits we...
32) 1) dialog: What time is it?
32) 3) dialog: I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
32) 6) dialog: Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
32) 8) dialog: Lloyd, be careful...
32) 15) dialog: (very low) I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
32) 18) dialog: Roughly ten minutes. 
32) 20) dialog: Three or four miles...
32) 22) dialog: (looking) None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
32) 25) dialog: You'll break your neck on that ice. 
32) 27) dialog: Don't joke about such things.
32) 31) dialog: He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
32) 33) dialog: (smiles) I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down. 
32) 36) dialog: It doesn't matter. 
32) 39) dialog: We've all seemed a little tense lately...
32) 41) dialog: We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
32) 43) dialog: You're Margo. Just - Margo. 
32) 45) dialog: What about Bill?
32) 47) dialog: He's in love with you. 
32) 49) dialog: Why should he - and why should you? 
32) 51) dialog: Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you. 
32) 53) dialog: Not to you. Not to Bill.
32) 56) dialog: Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm... Margo nods, get some cigarettes out of her bag. She offer one to Karen. They light up. 
32) 58) dialog: Well...
32) 60) dialog: Margo. (she hesitates) Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
32) 62) dialog: (indicating their predicament) This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
37) 0) text: Karen consults her watch and the doorman as she enters. 
37) 1) dialog: Has Miss Channing come in?
37) 3) dialog: Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
37) 6) dialog: (pleased) Then you've heard too. 
37) 8) dialog: (staggered) You were there? At the play - last night?
37) 11) dialog: They certainly don't waste much time. 
37) 15) dialog: (smiles) Margo. 
37) 17) dialog: It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one. 
38) 0) text: Addison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides a reading it. Karen sits miserably. 
38) 2) dialog: I just can't believe it. 
38) 4) dialog: I can't believe Eve said those things! Margo crumples the paper as if it were Eve's neck. 
38) 6) dialog: (weakly) Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
38) 10) dialog: I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
39) 0) text: Karen's having some lunch. Lloyd, still in his robe, sits opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette. A copy o the interview before him. 
39) 2) dialog: Where'd you get all that information?
39) 4) dialog: Eve?
39) 6) dialog: That was a pity...
39) 8) dialog: I wonder why. Lloyd wanders about - he seems to be searching for words, a position to maintain...
39) 11) dialog: That's quite a change of subject. 
39) 13) dialog: I'm trying hard to follow you.
39) 15) dialog: I'm beginning to catch up. 
39) 17) dialog: (carefully) Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it? 
39) 19) dialog: Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.  A pause. 
39) 21) dialog: Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello. 
39) 23) dialog: With gestures, of course. 
39) 25) dialog: Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
39) 27) dialog: Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
39) 29) dialog: It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious! Lloyd's full of anger and guilt. He snaps back.
39) 31) dialog: On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
39) 33) dialog: The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys! The phone has been ringing. Lloyd snarls into it.
39) 36) dialog: (smiles) Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb. 
39) 38) dialog: They'd die without each other.  A pause. 
39) 40) dialog: Such as?
39) 42) dialog: That's fine. Fine and dandy. I'd enjoy nothing more. Just refer all of Miss Harrington's future requests to me...
40) 0) text: Margo, Karen, Bill and Lloyd are ensconced happily at a t in the rear of the room. A bottle of fine wine is being poured. Their mood is equally bubbly. 
40) 14) dialog: Margo!
40) 16) dialog: When? When are you going to do it?
40) 23) dialog: (to Margo) What are you going to wear?
40) 28) dialog: Yes?
40) 32) dialog: (angrily) This beats all world's records for running, standing and jumping gall! She whips the note to Margo, who reads it aloud. 
40) 40) dialog: I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
40) 44) dialog: Well... all right. She gets up and goes. The CAMERA takes her past Addison's table. He rises in polite surprise. 
41) 0) text: Never having been, I can't say what it looks like. It is be hoped that there is an outer and inner room. We are concerned with the outer.  There is an attendant in charge, and a constantly changin flow of ladies who pause to make various repairs. All caf society - including one young drunk stretched out under a mink coat and a wet towel. There are two chairs - or a banquette - in a corner. Eve waits there. She rises as Karen approaches. 
41) 2) dialog: Don't get up. (she smiles grimly) And don't act as if I were the queen mother. 
41) 4) dialog: I don't intend to be. 
41) 7) dialog: There can't be very much-
41) 9) dialog: - and easy or not, I won't believe a word. 
41) 12) dialog: (leading her on) - and you felt just like that talking to Addison. 
41) 14) dialog: (sharply) Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
41) 16) dialog: Let's not get over-dramatic. 
41) 18) dialog: Eve... don't cry. 
41) 20) dialog: Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood? 
41) 22) dialog: But the raves about your performance-
41) 24) dialog: Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison. 
41) 26) dialog: He can help you. 
41) 28) dialog: Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
41) 30) dialog: (smiles) Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone. 
41) 32) dialog: Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...  (she gets up, her hand still on Eve's shoulder) ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do- Eve has reached up to take Karen's hand. She holds it now she turns slowly to face her. 
41) 34) dialog: I think I know...
41) 36) dialog: You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it. 
41) 38) dialog: After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo? 
41) 40) dialog: You talk just as Addison said you did. 
41) 42) dialog: I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.  She turns away again, but Eve's grip is like a vise. 
41) 44) dialog: Over my dead body...
41) 46) dialog: A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play. 
42) 18) dialog: Nothing much. She apologized. 
42) 20) dialog: With tears. 
42) 22) dialog: Check. 
42) 25) dialog: Not much.
42) 43) dialog: (quietly) I remember. 
42) 51) dialog: (explodes) What? Margo misinterprets her vehemence. 
42) 56) dialog: Nothing...
42) 58) dialog: Everything... everything's so funny...  Margo removes the champagne glass from in front of Karen. FADE OUT.
43) 0) text: Karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box. Lloyd beside Max up front. On stage, the play is "on its feet." Eve plays a dramatic scene with a young man. They carry "sides" but do not con them. As she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium.  Bill calls a halt. He indicates to Eve that she was to ha remained downstage.  Eve seems to be at a loss. She looks at Lloyd.  Lloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change.  Bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to writing, he'll do the directing. It mounts swiftly to a screaming fight. Bill throws the script out into the auditorium, takes his coat and stalks off. Eve runs after him. Max retrieves the script. Lloyd remai adamant. Karen has risen in dismay.  Eve drags Bill back. Without looking at Lloyd, he takes t script from Max, tells the actors to pick up where they l off.  Eve whispers to Lloyd from the stage. Lloyd smiles, mollified, sits down again with Max.  Karen walks up the side aisle, out of the theater...
44) 0) text: It is a lovely, large room. Two double beds, not alongsid each other and each with an extension phone beside it. In addition to the door to the living room, there are two mo to separate dressing rooms and baths. Lloyd is asleep. Bu not Karen. She turns restlessly, finally sits up, lights cigarette. 
44) 2) dialog: Hello... who?... who's calling Mr. Richards?
45) 3) dialog: (into phone) Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards? Lloyd picks up his phone. 
45) 14) dialog: (finally) Aren't you... broadening the duties of a playwright just a bit? Rushing off in the middle of the night  like a country doctor? No answer except the opening and closing of drawers. 
45) 15) dialog: What would you do if, instead of Eve, the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical? Still no answer. Her tension increasing, Karen goes back the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides swiftly back to the open door. 
45) 16) dialog: Lloyd, I don't want you to go! Now Lloyd appears. He's in flannels, and a sport shirt wi no tie. He's confused and guilty and tortured.
45) 18) dialog: I'm a human being, I've got some!
45) 20) dialog: Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
45) 22) dialog: Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career! Lloyd comes out wearing a jacket. He crosses to the door, Karen after him.
45) 23) dialog: That first, last, and foremost - your reason for going now is that you want to be with Eve! Three in the morning or high noon - play or no play - wife or no wife! (Lloyd stops at the door) Isn't it true, Lloyd? Lloyd goes out. Karen looks after him, despairing.
48) 27) dialog: She knows enough not to be here.
50) 15) dialog: Congratulations, Eve.
