4) 11) dialog: Yeah. Hopefully she won't use it. Luke turns and looks around again.
4) 13) dialog: Brie, like the cheese. And actually, I think I see her car.
4) 15) dialog: Wait. Just hang on the line a second.
4) 18) dialog: Alright, I’1l talk to you later man.

6) 19) dialog: The L.A. Times.
6) 21) dialog: Well, they have this kind of long- winded editorial process so I’m getting bounced around a little bit. But they’re giving me time, which is nice.
6) 23) dialog: That’s the plan. I took out a loan from the bank. (beat) I figure it’s like going back to school but I get to spend the money the way I want.
6) 25) dialog: They gave me a loan for five thousand dollars.
6) 27) dialog: I’m eating sandwiches. Brie raises her eyebrows.
6) 29) dialog: Well I’m just more frugal than you are.
6) 31) dialog: I always thought it would be funny to do a spoof show of “The Fraggles”, you know that show?
6) 33) dialog: But have it be “The Frugals” instead and it’s just a bunch of tight wad investors and bankers living underground being like “You spent how much on socks!?” Brie chuckles. Luke is pleased. They take a drag.
6) 34) dialog: How about you? How’ve you been?
6) 36) dialog: Yeah but that building would collapse if you weren't there.
6) 38) dialog: Well, what else would you be doing?
6) 40) dialog: Yeah, totally.
6) 42) dialog: How expensive?
6) 44) dialog: I know what you mean. I won a game show and-
6) 46) dialog: Yeah.
6) 48) dialog: You haven't heard of it.
6) 50) dialog: Nobody's heard of it.
6) 52) dialog: It’s called On the Cover.
6) 54) dialog: See?
6) 56) dialog: It’s just. They show you a fake magazine cover of like, People Magazine with Denzel Washington's picture on it and you have to name who’s “on the cover”.
6) 58) dialog: Yeah.
6) 60) dialog: It is.
6) 62) dialog: Have you ever done it? It’s tough getting that buzzer to work before anyone else's.
6) 64) dialog: Yeah.
6) 66) dialog: Ten thousand bucks.
6) 68) dialog: Yeah, so that Christmas was the first time I could ever afford to get everyone in my family cool presents.
6) 70) dialog: I’m usually the guy that gives everyone a CD or a book, but I actually got some cool gifts that year.
6) 72) dialog: Exactly.
6) 74) dialog: Why, you gonna order more expensive drinks?
6) 76) dialog: None.
6) 78) dialog: Really, none. I bought a car. Not a new one or anything. A used one, but I bought it straight up. Caaash.
6) 80) dialog: Broke is a strong word. No, I got the loan. I got some savings. And I have a car.
6) 82) dialog: I don’t know if it’s still on the air. They pause and smoke their cigarettes. 25.
6) 84) dialog: Okay, what's the capitol of Cyprus?
6) 86) dialog: Sure.
6) 88) dialog: Really?
6) 90) dialog: I’m impressed. Most people something about Cyprus on the news and think it’s like, a made-up country.
6) 93) dialog: Moms love beach houses. 26.
6) 95) dialog: What did your dad get?
6) 97) dialog: My mom asked me to make her a mix last year. She wanted to know what I was listening to. I put some songs on a CD for her and gave it to her. I made her a mixtape. I put “2 Minutes to Midnight” by Iron Maiden as a hidden bonus track at the end and she wasn’t nearly as amused about that as I was.
6) 99) dialog: (sings but trails off mid- way ) “2 Minutes to Midnight!!!!" Brie nods and looks around. A girl clacks outside on her heels. She pulls up next to Brie. Her name is STACY and she talks loudly into her cel phone.
6) 105) dialog: Savor it, that’s what I say.
6) 107) dialog: Sometimes. They look around at the few other people standing outside few feet away stand a GUY and a GIRL seemingly not very h with each other. The guy holds his phone out and is texting away. The girl looks at him with disgust. After a moment and in one fell swoop she SWATS the phone of his hands and it BOUNCES on the concrete.
6) 109) dialog: Yikes.
6) 111) dialog: I think so too. They look again but the couple have wandered off up the street.
6) 112) dialog: Have you ever been in a fight?
6) 114) dialog: Yeah. In eighth grade. Everybody was picking fights and it was like, the cool thing. So I picked the smallest, weakest guy in the class and I made him fight me.
6) 116) dialog: I know. His name was Dawson Mullen and he was from Canada.
6) 118) dialog: Our high school was right next to this movie theatre called the Bijou. When you wanted to pick a fight with someone, you went up to them and said ‘Bijou parking lot. Two Thirty.’
6) 120) dialog: Yeah. The thrown gauntlet. Bijou parking lot was where all the real shit went down. Pot smoking. All that.
6) 122) dialog: So. There were a bunch of kids all waiting on the grassy side of this movie theatre. And they form this big circle and we get in the middle. And Dawson is like “Come on, start something. Start something.” So I pushed him and he just clocks me in the face. Out of nowhere.
6) 124) dialog: I didn’t fall over or anything but man, it hurt. And I guess normal people get angry when they get punched in the face but I just kind of realized that fighting was dumb.
6) 126) dialog: He sort of knocked some sense into me. So, that was the end of the fight.
6) 128) dialog: I forfeited.
6) 132) dialog: Huh.
6) 134) dialog: I was in West Side Story.
6) 136) dialog: (thinks) Like, Jet Boy number four. Brie laughs.
6) 138) dialog: I remember we had to give ourselves names on these character sheets, to make you feel like you were really “acting.” And so I turned mine in with the name “Davey”. But my friends all turned in these cool names like “Action” and “One Punch”. And I was stuck with “Davey”.
6) 140) dialog: Can I have another one of those? 31. Brie hands Luke another cigarette and he lights it with h
6) 141) dialog: My high school did this Shakespeare play called “The Merry Wives of Windsor”. I wasn’t in it but I saw it, and there’s a scene where two guys are talking to each other. And they’re talking about something, but I guess they forget their lines because there’s just this sudden silence: like, fifteen seconds of nothing. Then one guy turns to the other and says “So, how ‘bout the Bulls?”
6) 143) dialog: Swear to God. And this is during the playoffs, so the other guy’s like: “Repeat the three-peat!” So they talk about the Bulls for a good two minutes. I guess someone was supposed to enter and they didn’t or something, but then the three-peat guy just got up and started doing the worm.
6) 145) dialog: The audience loved it. They all cheered when he did the worm. In the middle of “The Merry Wives of Windsor”.
6) 147) dialog: That’s Tennessee.
6) 149) dialog: Yeah.
6) 151) dialog: Poison boot?
6) 153) dialog: That’s worse than the worm.
6) 155) dialog: Do you still do any theater?
6) 157) dialog: Yeah, me too. My swansong was the Head Flying Monkey in “The Wiz”.
6) 159) dialog: No, no. “The Wiz”.
6) 161) dialog: Oh yeah. Public school’s are all about color blind casting. We had white people trying to sing soul in “The Wiz”, we did “The Sound of Music” with three white and two Filipino Von Trapp kids. And we even had black Nazis in “The Sound of Music”.
6) 163) dialog: Jesus. I haven’t thought about this stuff in a long time. It is absurd.
6) 166) dialog: Yeah. They turn to head back into the bar and are met at the doorway by Scott, Darrell and Josh heading out. scoTtrT Hey, we're heading to that other bar if you guys want to come.
6) 167) dialog: Umm. I think we’re gonna hang out here a bit more. sScoTtT Okay. Come to Saddle Ranch on Sunset if you change your mind.

9) 7) dialog: Sounds like a big operation. 35.
9) 9) dialog: The kids respond to pressure like that?

12) 14) dialog: What do you think about that? 47.
12) 16) dialog: About the fact that men are supposed to buy the drinks? Don’t you think they’re only buying drinks to get you drunk?
12) 18) dialog: Yeah. Brie holds up her drink.
12) 20) dialog: No, but pizza guys might be.
12) 22) dialog: Isn't that patronizing?
12) 24) dialog: So ‘A’ is the initial contact?
12) 26) dialog: What happens when you get to ‘C’? 48.
12) 28) dialog: What if you make the initial contact? Then by the time it gets to ‘C’, the ball is in their court.

14) 18) dialog: When did you first have sex?
14) 20) dialog: Well, this girl was a field hockey player, but she didn’t start playing until six months after we started going out. She tried out on a lark: I remember being like, ‘You're gonna do what?’ (beat) We weren’t very sporty the two of us. But she liked it. She went to practice all the time. It is nice to watch girls in skirts beating the hell out of each other on a spring afternoon.
14) 22) dialog: And guess what she’s doing now?
14) 24) dialog: Oh, nice. No, she’s a cop.
14) 26) dialog: I'm telling the truth. We used to sit around and smoke pot and she’d talk about wanting to join the FBI. But now she’s really a cop in my hometown. Whenever I go to see my parents I have these fantasies of driving real fast and then getting pulled over and then there she is. Brie looks at him questioningly.
14) 28) dialog: No, it’s not like that. I’d just like to see her again. It’s been... six or so years since I’ve seen her. 54.

14) 46) dialog: What? What?
14) 47) dialog: Oh, to the party?
14) 49) dialog: Go to the party?
14) 51) dialog: Um. Do you think it’1ll be weird, I mean is it just a bunch of good friends?
