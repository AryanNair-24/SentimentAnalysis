0) 175) dialog: You still going to the movies?
0) 177) dialog: Oh, yeah.   I was a real knockout.
0) 179) dialog: Well, here I am.     Local cheerleader makes good.
0) 181) dialog: Yeah?
0) 183) dialog: Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen, if that's what you mean. There is an awkward pause.    PUPKIN stares admiringly at RITA.
0) 184) dialog: Well, how are things with you, Rupert?
0) 186) dialog: Is that right?
0) 189) dialog: Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!
0) 192) dialog: Why, you got something better?
0) 194) dialog: What?
0) 196) dialog: Tonight? RITA starts laughing.
0) 198) dialog: (still laughing) You call me up all junior and    senior year. Night after night after night,    right? And every time I'm wondering 'when    is this guy going to stop talking and ask    me out?' Well, now I know the answer.     August twelfth, nineteen seventy-six.     It only took you ten, eleven years to    work up to it.
0) 200) dialog: Oh, no.
0) 202) dialog: Because I thought you were a jerk!
0) 205) dialog: (to PUPKIN) Excuse me a minute, honey.

0) 211) dialog: How much?
0) 213) dialog: How much do we have to get to know each other?
0) 215) dialog: (emphatically) How much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job?
0) 217) dialog: Then what's this big offer you were talking about?
0) 219) dialog: I'm sorry, Rupert.     But I'm busy.
0) 221) dialog: Yeah.   Busy.
0) 223) dialog: I've already got a date. The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.
0) 227) dialog: None of your business.
0) 229) dialog: He's a good friend of mine.
0) 231) dialog: What's so important about tonight?
0) 233) dialog: No. I don't. It's been really nice seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping in. But I've got some work to do. RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.
0) 239) dialog: I have work to do, Rupert.
0) 241) dialog: No kidding?
0) 246) dialog: (to the THIRD MAN) I'll get you another one. As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MA walks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN glances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.
0) 250) dialog: (to NICHOLS) He was making trouble one minute and the next he was on the floor. RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she thinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.
0) 252) dialog: Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?
0) 255) dialog: Another one, Chan.
0) 258) dialog: So all this time you've been thinking about me, huh?
0) 260) dialog: What kinds of things were you thinking? PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly.      RITA starts laughing.
0) 261) dialog: Oh, ho! Those kinds of things!    Shame on you, Rupert.
0) 263) dialog: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!
0) 265) dialog: (in a whisper) Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh, come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun. WAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a bee for PUPKIN.
0) 267) dialog: Did you know your nose wiggled when you talked? PUPKIN
0) 269) dialog: Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit. (pause) Hey, are we gonna eat or what? I'm starving. PUPKIN serves RITA.
0) 270) dialog: It always looks like they put worms in this stuff. PUPKIN
0) 271) text: Just taste. RITA tastes.
0) 272) dialog: Well, I guess it won't kill me.
0) 274) dialog: Yeah? Then what happened to the tablecloths? PUPKIN drops his eyes.
0) 275) dialog: Oh, don't worry about it.   This is fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm having a good time. So you've been devoted to me, huh?
0) 277) dialog: Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for 'em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens. What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny. RITA chuckles to herself.
0) 279) dialog: Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't have the money for the right coach. But what difference does it make? She starts laughing to herself.
0) 280) dialog: I remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up.
0) 282) dialog: Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I got married?
0) 284) dialog: You think I should have married you, instead, huh?
0) 286) dialog: If he'd only been hit by a train. He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive, I can tell you that. RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearb talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER come over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the YOUNG MAN.
0) 288) dialog: What do you mean?
0) 290) dialog: Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And Thursday --- let's see --
0) 292) dialog: (imitating him) I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice) Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people.
0) 294) dialog: (chuckling) You mean am I "going steady"?   Rupert, I'm thirty-one years old!
0) 296) dialog: Him?
0) 298) dialog: What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home watching TV? He's just some guy. He's got his own aluminum siding business. He comes into the city sometimes, that's all.
0) 300) dialog: Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of me.
0) 303) dialog: You are, Rupert.     Especially your nose.
0) 305) dialog: Is this some kind of game? Are you going to tell me something about my character? PUPKIN
0) 307) dialog: I can't think of anybody.
0) 309) dialog: Okay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause) Marilyn Monroe. PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket. RITA
0) 310) text: Oh, Rupert!    Are we going to exchange phone numbers!? PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and, keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name, he turns the book to RITA.
0) 311) dialog: That's her name.
0) 314) dialog: Who's this one? PUPKIN checks the book.
0) 316) dialog: Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes. Who's this? PUPKIN

0) 324) dialog: You don't really know any of these people?
0) 326) dialog: (squinting) I can't make it out. PUPKIN
0) 328) dialog: This is really weird handwriting! Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his index finger.
0) 330) dialog: (guessing) Redford!
0) 338) dialog: (suppressing a smile) Your act? PUPKIN
0) 339) text: Get    that guy you knew from Clifton out of    your head right now. You're looking at    Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin, the    new King of Comedy. RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.
0) 340) dialog: (getting a grip on herself) I'm sorry.
0) 343) dialog: It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I really hope you get what you want. But it's getting late and I'm a working girl. You know what I mean? The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringin A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.
0) 345) dialog: You really want to help me out? You see this. (She points to her lower back molar) A hundred seventy-five bucks. If you could spare fifty, say, until next Monday, that would keep three people really happy -- me, my landlord and my dentist. During RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.
0) 347) dialog: (looking puzzled) Me? Nobody knows I'm here.   You didn't tell anybody, did you?
0) 349) dialog: (getting up) What the hell's going on? CAMERA FOLLOWS RITA, who walks to the back of the restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of the two facing booths, the other of which is occupied.
0) 351) dialog: Hello?
0) 353) dialog: Who is this?
0) 355) dialog: Where are you? The YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on th glass door of his booth. RITA, hearing the noise, turns around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She smiles.
0) 358) dialog: (with repressed gaiety)
0) 361) dialog: (gathering her things)
0) 365) dialog: Oh, no.   I do. Really!
0) 367) dialog: Don't be angry. It has nothing to do with you. I had a nice dinner, really. It was great seeing you again. PUPKIN stare at her icily.

1) 0) text: CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jump into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes after them,   positioning himself across from    the buil He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where th have gone.    Finally a set of lights go on on    the fou floor and a   MAN's shadow is seen closing two    sets of blinds.

1) 239) text: Testing.   Testing.   Testing. In the following montage, we hear in the background the replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At th same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look at the collages which include all the obvious show busine figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Cliffor Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a specia Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black, Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray. There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langfor in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters, Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marke i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:    7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC. MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."
2) 132) dialog: What are we going to do?
2) 135) dialog: But what about me?
2) 137) dialog: That's fine, but while you two are talking, what am I going to do?
2) 139) dialog: I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer. (pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model, okay?
2) 141) dialog: If they ask what I do, let's just say I model. You don't mind pretending just a little, do you?
2) 143) dialog: This is    a gas! Too bad nobody'll believe    it. (pause) After you guys are done    working, what happens? Are we going    out someplace, or what?
2) 145) dialog: What do    these people do for fun? Do they    party or do freaky things or just    get drunk or ... I mean, What do    they do?
2) 147) dialog: Talk?!? What can you talk about for three or four hours?!
2) 149) dialog: Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks. That's what all those shows are. At least they help you get to sleep. There is a pause.
2) 150) dialog: (glumly)
2) 153) text: Just take it easy, Rita.     Everything's going to be fine. WE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out.
2) 177) dialog: Look at that one. How'd you like to live in that?!?! Or that one! What do you figure these run? The taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is visible a handsome English stucco home.

2) 215) dialog: (admiringly) I could live here.
2) 217) dialog: How come he isn't here?
2) 219) dialog: Didn't you tell him when we'd get here? PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's suspicious inquiries effortlessly.
2) 221) dialog: (interrupting) That Jonno character hadn't even heard of us!
2) 223) dialog: It's just not time way I expected it, that's all. There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation. has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.
2) 224) dialog: What do we do now? PUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic c standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comment the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a k of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life.
2) 233) dialog: Look at this. I love these kind of things. Look at the work.   I've got this thing about boxes. RITA puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it down again.

2) 244) dialog: This is more like it. She pulls out a record.
2) 246) dialog: Come on, yourself. She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "The Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.
2) 247) dialog: How about a little spin, handsome?
2) 249) text: Here? RITA snuggles into PUPKIN and starts dancing him around. He resists feebly.
2) 250) dialog: Come on, Rupert.      I came up here for a good time. PUPKIN gives in and starts      dancing with her in the the 1950's, elbow out, arm      up, box step. After a moments, PUPKIN closes his      eyes. He has reached a of perfect bliss, his dream      girl in is arms. They silently as we hear Sinatra      singing.
2) 252) dialog: You never could dance, could you?
2) 254) dialog: Oh I danced with you a couple of times -- at the Sigma U party.
2) 256) dialog: You didn't ask me.
2) 258) dialog: Well, I couldn't go with you!
2) 260) dialog: Be serious, Rupert.
2) 266) dialog: I wonder what the rest of this place looks like?
2) 268) dialog: (gaily)
2) 269) text: Well, there's only one way to find out. RITA scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first step.
2) 270) dialog: You coming or not? RITA bounds up the stairs.
2) 279) text: What are you doing, Rita?
2) 280) dialog: I love it! All those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now.
2) 282) dialog: Relax, will you. Let me have a little fun, for Christ's sake. RITA gets off the bed and runs into the john.
2) 285) dialog: Look at this. It's nicer than my whole apartment. PUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom.   RIT examines her face in the mirror.
2) 287) text: Let's go, Rita.
2) 288) dialog: Boy, I really need some sun.
2) 290) dialog: Lay off, will you, Rupert.
2) 293) dialog: Here. She looks around.
2) 294) dialog: Now for something that smells nice. She swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door swings open violently and the mirror shatters against something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink. PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam o the downstairs door.
2) 302) text: Come on, Rita. No need to be shy. PUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD.       RITA co slowly down.
2) 304) dialog: (tentatively) Pleased to meet you. LANGFORD nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes alert. RITA, reading her frigid reception, looks to PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living room, toward the bar.
2) 328) dialog: What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he wants us out.
2) 330) dialog: Don't get me into this.
2) 336) dialog: Come on, Rupert, the man wants us to go.
2) 338) dialog: Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know anything about all this. I hardly know this guy. I haven't seen him in years.

PUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy smile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time for her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad expression on her face.
3) 429) dialog: (in a sad, serious voice to PUPKIN) That was true, wasn't it? ... about the kidnapping. PUPKIN nods and shrugs.
3) 433) dialog: Okay. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.
