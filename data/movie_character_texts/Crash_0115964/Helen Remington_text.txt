As James turns to continue, a young woman comes out of th same room that Vaughan appeared from and moves toward him using a dark wooden walking stick. She presses her face i her raised shoulder, possibly to hide the bruise marking right cheekbone. The woman is Dr. Helen Remington, whose husband died in h car crash with James. James stops as she approaches. He speaks without thinking
17) 9) text: The woman looks up at James as she continues her approach She does not falter, but changes her grip on the cane, as preparing to thrash him across the face with it. She move her head in a peculiar gesture of the neck, deliberately  forcing her injury on him. She pauses when she reaches the doorway, waiting for him step out of her way. James looks down at the scar tissue her face, a seam left by an invisible zip three inches lo running from the corner of her right eye to the apex of h mouth. James is acutely aware of her strong body beneath her mau bathrobe, her ribcage partly shielded by a sheath of whit plaster that runs from one shoulder to the opposite armpi like a classic Hollywood ball-gown. James steps aside. Deciding to ignore him, Helen Remingto walks stiffly along the communication corridor, parading anger and her wound.

At the far of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abrup contracted around the body of the driver. Unnerved by these deformations, James moves from one car the next until he comes to his own. The remains of towing tackle are attached to the front bumper, and the body pan are splashed with oil and dirt. He peers through the wind into the cabin, runs his hand over the mud-stained glass. Without thinking, he kneels in front of the car and stare at the crushed fenders and radiator grill. Two policemen cross the yard with a black Alsatian dog. T watch James hovering around his car as if they vaguely re his touching it. When they are gone, he unlatches the dri door and, with an effort, pulls it open. James eases himself on to the dusty vinyl seat, tipped ba by the bowing of the floor. He nervously lifts his legs i the car and places his feet on the rubber cleats of the  pedals, which have been forced out of the engine compartm so that his knees are pressed against his chest. The two policemen are exercising their dog across the yar James opens the glove compartment, forcing the shelf  downwards. Inside, covered with dirt and flaked plastic, a set of route maps, a mildly pornographic novel, a polar of Renata sitting in the car near a water reservoir with breasts exposed. James pulls open the ashtray, which promptly jumps on to lap, releasing a dozen lipstick-smeared butts. Someone passes in front of the car. A policeman's voice c from the gatehouse. Through the windshield, James sees a  woman in a white raincoat walking along the line of wreck cars. The woman -- Helen Remington -- approaches the car  next to his, a crushed convertible involved in a massive  rear-end collision. James sits quietly behind the steering wheel. Helen turns from the convertible. She glances at the hood of James's  car, clearly not recognizing the vehicle that killed her  husband. As she raises her head she sees James through th glassless windshield frame, sitting behind the deformed  steering wheel among the dried bloodstains of her husband Helen's strong eyes barely change their focus, but one ha rises involuntarily to her cheek. She takes in the damage the car, then takes in James. Without giving away anythin she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns an comes back as James gets out of his car. She gestures toward the damaged vehicles, then speaks to  James as though continuing a conversation already in prog

She pulls a cigarette packet from the pocket of her rainc She searches the instrument panel for the lighter, her ri hand hovering above his knees like a nervous bird. Having found the lighter, her strong hands tear away the  cellophane from the cigarette pack.

We sat in a  massive traffic jam under an off- ramp. I don't think we moved more  than fifty yards. (pause) I'm thinking of taking up a new job  with the Road Research Laboratory.  They need a medical officer. The  salary is larger -- something I've  got to think about now. There's a  certain moral virtue in being  materialistic, I'm beginning to feel.  Well, it's a new approach for me, in  any case.

He doesn't wait to see i they react, but immediately steps into the passenger side the Porsche, microphone still in hand.
38) 6) text: Vaughan hands the microphone to a stills cameraman who al functions as an assistant, and then sinks down into the s car. Seagrave starts the Porsche, which settles quickly into a husky idle. A few blips of the throttle, and then the Por is reversed down to the edge of the lighted strip of road When the Porsche stops, the excited crowd goes quiet. An  assistant with a walkie-talkie kneels beside the silver c on the driver's side, co-ordinating the start with his  opposite number standing next to the Ford over the hill. There is a calculated pause before anything happens, and  then the Porsche spins its wheels and accelerates up the  hill. From their vantage point in the stand, James and Helen ca clearly see that the Ford has also started and that the t cars are headed toward each other, each in its respective lane. The Porsche accelerates hard, the Ford lumbers along at a moderate pace, swaying clumsily on its soft springs. As the cars approach each other, James notices a fresh  clearing at the side of the road at just about the point  where they seem likely to pass. Sure enough, when the car are about thirty yards apart, the Ford wanders over the c line. As the Porsche approaches it, it seems to move back into its own lane, but then suddenly swerves again as tho making a left turn. The Porsche, in its turn, swerves to avoid the big Americ car but they collide, the immense chrome grill punching i the side of the fragile race car, crumpling it like a wad tin foil and shunting it unceremoniously off the road int the clearing that has been prepared for it. As the Porsche hobbles to a stop, Vaughan seems to stand on his seat and then throw himself out of the car, rollin over what's left of the front hood on to the ground. Seag remains slumped in the driver's seat. Vaughan lies still  where he lands, a few feet ahead of the crumpled nose of race car. The door of the Ford opens and Trask stumbles out. He beg to walk around in a dazed and agitated manner, and the cr which has been buzzing, goes silent again. Trask walks aw from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at th edge of the road.

Most of them are crude frontal pic of motor-cars and heavy vehicles involved in highway  collisions, surrounded by spectators and police, and clos ups of impacted radiator grills and windshields. Vaughan opens the album at random and hands it to James. leans back against the door and watches as James adjusts desk lamp. The first thirty pages record the crash, hospitalization, and post-recuperative romance of the young woman Gabriell a social worker, the photos suggest -- who is currently  getting very stoned in the next room. By coincidence, her small sports car had collided with an airline bus at the entry to the airport not far from the  site of James's own accident.

A motorcycle is in the process of having a head-on collis with a sedan bearing a family of four -- an extremely vio and disturbing crash, despite the use of cradles, dummies rails, cables and extensive metering and recording techno Among the many witnesses to the crash, including numerous engineers, technicians and Transport Ministry officials, James, Helen and Vaughan. Vaughan is energetically masturbating through his jeans,  shielded by a sheaf of publicity folders which he holds i his other hand. There is a terrific metallic explosion as the motorcycle  strikes the front of the sedan. The two vehicles veer sid towards the line of startled spectators. The motorcyclist and his bike sail over the hood of the c and strike the windshield, then careen across the roof in black mass of fragments. The car plunges ten feet back on its hawsers and comes to rest astride its rails. The hood, windshield and roof hav been crushed by the impact. Inside the cabin, the lopside family lurch across each other, the decapitated torso of front-seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured  windshield. The engineers wave to the crowd reassuringly and move tow the motorcycle, which lies on its side fifty yards behind the car. But it is Vaughan -- a black-jacketed figure str on long, uneven legs -- who arrives first at the bike. For a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up him but he then backs away to where technicians are picking u pieces of the motorcyclist's body, and then turns away  completely and rejoins Helen and James. Vaughan holds up the bundle of technical hand-outs in his grip.

Two women sit behind the windshield peering into the darkness. A pause, and then the car moves forward, its driver turni the wheel until the headlamps illuminate the remains of t dismembered vehicle in which Vaughan died. The woman in the passenger seat steps out and pauses brie by the gates. It is Helen Remington. When she helps the d out of the car, James and Catherine see that it is the  crippled Gabrielle, her leg shackles clacking as she and  Helen begin to walk toward Vaughan's car. They stroll haltingly, arms around each other, like stran lovers in a cemetery visiting a favorite mausoleum. At on point, Helen kisses Gabrielle's hand, and it is obvious t they have become lovers. James and Catherine circle away from the couple and make  their way back to the gatehouse. In the depths of the pound, Helen helps Gabrielle into th Lincoln. In the darkness of the back seat, they embrace.
