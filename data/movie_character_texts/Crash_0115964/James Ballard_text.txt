Monitored by a bored, seen-it-all middle-aged  saleswoman, James glances now and then through the curtai to watch Karen help Catherine try on underwear. Karen, Catherine's secretary, a moody, unsmiling girl, is methodically involved in the soft technology of Catherine breasts and the brassiГЁres designed to show them off. Karen touches Catherine with peculiar caresses, tapping h lightly with the tips of her fingers, first upon the  shoulders, along the pink grooves left by her underwear,  then across her back, where the metal clasps of her brass have left a medallion of impressed skin, and finally on t elastic-patterned grooves beneath Catherine's breasts  themselves. Catherine stands through this in a trance-like state, gab to herself in a low voice, as the tip of Karen's right  forefinger surreptitiously touches her nipple.

As we move around him, we reveal his secretary, Renata,  sitting and watching him intently from the vantage point her corner chair, her hand poised to write down anything might say in a small, leather-bound notebook. From her point of view, we watch James from behind as he  works. Every movement he makes -- bending over to correct panel, manipulating the pencil, touching the sharp point the pencil to his lip, straightening up again -- provokes different tiny response from Renata, so attuned to him is she. But he says nothing to her, and she remains poised and  vigilant.

The propelled man's blood spatters James's face and chest his body coming to rest half inside James's car, its head dangling down into the dark recess of the passenger footw James's chest hits the steering wheel, his knees crush in the instrument panel, his forehead hits the upper windshi frame. As this happens, James is vaguely conscious of the same thing happening to the woman driving the other car, though she is a bizarre mirror image. Slammed back into their seats after the initial impact, J and the woman look at each other through the shattered  windshields, neither able to move. The woman, handsome an intelligent-looking, supported by her seat-belt, stares a James in a curiously formal way, as if unsure what has br them together. Out of the corner of his eye, James can see the hand of t dead passenger, now his passenger, caught on the dashboar and lying palm upwards only a few inches away from him. J squints as he tries to focus on a huge blood-blister, pum up by the man's dying circulation, which has a distinct t shape.

James's legs are up in a sling, drainage tubes coming fro both knees. Wounds on his chest: broken skin around the l edge of the sternum, where the horn boss had been driven  upwards by the collapsing engine compartment; a semicircu bruise, a marbled rainbow, running from one nipple to the other. Stitches in the laceration across the scalp, a sec hairline an inch below the original. Unshaven face and  fretting hands.

A white-coated doctor -- Vaughan -- steps into the ward f a room at the end of the hall. He is bare-chested under h white coat. His strong hands carry a briefcase filled wit photographs, which he pauses to shuffle through, as thoug checking a map. As James approaches this new visitor, Vaughan's pockmarke jaws chomp on a piece of gum, creating the impression tha he might be hawking obscene pictures around the wards,  pornographic X-ray plates and blacklisted urinalyses. He  sports copious scar tissue around his forehead and mouth, rumpled and puckered as though residues from some terrify act of violence.

She move her head in a peculiar gesture of the neck, deliberately  forcing her injury on him. She pauses when she reaches the doorway, waiting for him step out of her way. James looks down at the scar tissue her face, a seam left by an invisible zip three inches lo running from the corner of her right eye to the apex of h mouth. James is acutely aware of her strong body beneath her mau bathrobe, her ribcage partly shielded by a sheath of whit plaster that runs from one shoulder to the opposite armpi like a classic Hollywood ball-gown.

In one them, a white laundry-van has bumped into the back of a s filled with wedding guests. James gazes raptly down at this immense motion sculpture, this incomprehensible pinball machine.

At the far of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abrup contracted around the body of the driver. Unnerved by these deformations, James moves from one car the next until he comes to his own. The remains of towing tackle are attached to the front bumper, and the body pan are splashed with oil and dirt. He peers through the wind into the cabin, runs his hand over the mud-stained glass. Without thinking, he kneels in front of the car and stare at the crushed fenders and radiator grill. Two policemen cross the yard with a black Alsatian dog. T watch James hovering around his car as if they vaguely re his touching it. When they are gone, he unlatches the dri door and, with an effort, pulls it open. James eases himself on to the dusty vinyl seat, tipped ba by the bowing of the floor. He nervously lifts his legs i the car and places his feet on the rubber cleats of the  pedals, which have been forced out of the engine compartm so that his knees are pressed against his chest. The two policemen are exercising their dog across the yar James opens the glove compartment, forcing the shelf  downwards. Inside, covered with dirt and flaked plastic, a set of route maps, a mildly pornographic novel, a polar of Renata sitting in the car near a water reservoir with breasts exposed. James pulls open the ashtray, which promptly jumps on to lap, releasing a dozen lipstick-smeared butts. Someone passes in front of the car. A policeman's voice c from the gatehouse. Through the windshield, James sees a  woman in a white raincoat walking along the line of wreck cars. The woman -- Helen Remington -- approaches the car  next to his, a crushed convertible involved in a massive  rear-end collision. James sits quietly behind the steering wheel. Helen turns from the convertible. She glances at the hood of James's  car, clearly not recognizing the vehicle that killed her  husband. As she raises her head she sees James through th glassless windshield frame, sitting behind the deformed  steering wheel among the dried bloodstains of her husband Helen's strong eyes barely change their focus, but one ha rises involuntarily to her cheek. She takes in the damage the car, then takes in James. Without giving away anythin she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns an comes back as James gets out of his car.

As he talks, Vaughan tours the phalanx of tripod-mounted  cameras to check their placement, and chats off-mike with the pair of cameramen with hand-held cameras.

An  assistant with a walkie-talkie kneels beside the silver c on the driver's side, co-ordinating the start with his  opposite number standing next to the Ford over the hill. There is a calculated pause before anything happens, and  then the Porsche spins its wheels and accelerates up the  hill. From their vantage point in the stand, James and Helen ca clearly see that the Ford has also started and that the t cars are headed toward each other, each in its respective lane. The Porsche accelerates hard, the Ford lumbers along at a moderate pace, swaying clumsily on its soft springs. As the cars approach each other, James notices a fresh  clearing at the side of the road at just about the point  where they seem likely to pass. Sure enough, when the car are about thirty yards apart, the Ford wanders over the c line. As the Porsche approaches it, it seems to move back into its own lane, but then suddenly swerves again as tho making a left turn. The Porsche, in its turn, swerves to avoid the big Americ car but they collide, the immense chrome grill punching i the side of the fragile race car, crumpling it like a wad tin foil and shunting it unceremoniously off the road int the clearing that has been prepared for it. As the Porsche hobbles to a stop, Vaughan seems to stand on his seat and then throw himself out of the car, rollin over what's left of the front hood on to the ground. Seag remains slumped in the driver's seat. Vaughan lies still  where he lands, a few feet ahead of the crumpled nose of race car. The door of the Ford opens and Trask stumbles out. He beg to walk around in a dazed and agitated manner, and the cr which has been buzzing, goes silent again. Trask walks aw from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at th edge of the road.

At one point he sees her with her hands resting on the  steering wheel, her right index finger picking at an old  adhesive label on the windshield. And then, abruptly, James is aware of the dented fender o Vaughan's Lincoln only a few feet behind Catherine's spor car. Vaughan now surges past James, crowding along the roadway if waiting for Catherine to make a mistake. Startled,  Catherine takes refuge in front of an airline bus in the  nearside lane. Vaughan drives alongside the bus, using hi horn and lights to force the driver back, and again cuts behind Catherine. James moves ahead along the center lane, shouting to Vaug as he passes him, but Vaughan is signalling to Catherine, pumping his headlights at her rear fender. Without thinking, Catherine pulls into the courtyard of a filling station, forcing Vaughan into a heavy U-turn. Tir screaming, he swings around the ornamental flower-bed wit its glazed pottery plants, but James blocks his way with own car. Heart racing, Catherine sits still in her car among the f pumps, her eyes flashing at Vaughan. James steps from his car and walks across to Vaughan, who watches James approach as if he had never seen him before scarred mouth working on a piece of gum as he gazes at th aircrafts taking off from the airport.

A motorcycle is in the process of having a head-on collis with a sedan bearing a family of four -- an extremely vio and disturbing crash, despite the use of cradles, dummies rails, cables and extensive metering and recording techno Among the many witnesses to the crash, including numerous engineers, technicians and Transport Ministry officials, James, Helen and Vaughan. Vaughan is energetically masturbating through his jeans,  shielded by a sheaf of publicity folders which he holds i his other hand. There is a terrific metallic explosion as the motorcycle  strikes the front of the sedan. The two vehicles veer sid towards the line of startled spectators. The motorcyclist and his bike sail over the hood of the c and strike the windshield, then careen across the roof in black mass of fragments. The car plunges ten feet back on its hawsers and comes to rest astride its rails. The hood, windshield and roof hav been crushed by the impact. Inside the cabin, the lopside family lurch across each other, the decapitated torso of front-seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured  windshield. The engineers wave to the crowd reassuringly and move tow the motorcycle, which lies on its side fifty yards behind the car. But it is Vaughan -- a black-jacketed figure str on long, uneven legs -- who arrives first at the bike. For a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up him but he then backs away to where technicians are picking u pieces of the motorcyclist's body, and then turns away  completely and rejoins Helen and James. Vaughan holds up the bundle of technical hand-outs in his grip.

Siren whining, a third ambulance drives down the oncoming lane. A police motorcyclist cuts in front of James and sl to a halt, signalling him to wait and allow the ambulance pass. James stops the car. Ten yards from them is the crushed limousine, the body of the young chauffeur still lying on the ground beside it.  Three engineers work with surreal hand-tools and hydrauli cutting and prying equipment at the rear doors of the  limousine. They sever the jammed door mechanism and pull  back the door to expose the passengers trapped inside the compartment. The two passengers, a pink-faced man in his fifties weari a black overcoat, and a younger woman with a pale, anemic skin, still sit upright, staring blankly, in the rear sea A policeman pulls away the traveling rug that covers thei legs and waists. The woman's legs are bare, the older man feet splayed, apparently broken at the ankles. The woman' skirt has ridden up around her waist, and her left hand h the window strap. As the older man turns to the woman, one hand searching f her, he slips sideways off the seat, his ankles kicking a the clutter of leather valises and broken glass. The traffic stream moves on.

64) 0) text: James walks back alone, eventually spotting them among th throng of spectators, Catherine watching Vaughan's scarre face intently, provocatively, as he photographs every asp of the accident. There is a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the among the onlookers, and even a congregational feeling as one group of engineers works on the crushed sports sedan, prying at the metal roof which has been flattened on to t heads of the occupants. And now Vaughan poses an only slightly reluctant Catherin against the backdrop of the stricken taxi as though she w one of the shaken survivors of the accident. When the roof of the sports sedan is levered up, the hair the driver, its only passenger, comes off with it as thou scalped, stuck to the roofliner with drying blood. But it soon apparent that it's not hair, but rather a cheap, tan platinum blond wig. Vaughan makes his way over to the sedan, intrigued by the dangling 'scalp', which is almost phosphorescent in the r rescue work lights. Catherine trails obediently behind hi like a harshly disciplined puppy. When the body of the driver is exposed to the lights, the effect is doubly grotesque, for not only is the driver de and partially crushed, but he is also a cross-dresser:  Seagrave, in Jayne Mansfield drag. His long, greasy hair tied up in a knot on his head, he is unshaven, his huge,  fake bosom is bloody and askew; his bloated, muscular bod strains against the pink 60s skirt and jacket, the blue s boots with high heels. There is also a dead Chihuahua bitch inside the car with  Seagrave, which Vaughan manages to move with his foot unt a cop, outraged, shoos him away. The dog is stiff with ri mortis, obviously dead long before the crash. An excited Vaughan has spotted James and now approaches h breathless.

When he turns around, he sees that Vaughan is holding in his cupped rig hand his wife's bare breast. James fumbles for change as Vaughan caresses Catherine's  nipple in the back seat.

The gantry engine begins to drum. The rollers pound acros the hood of the Lincoln and roar forward to the windshiel driving the soap solution into a whirlwind of froth. Cath settles over Vaughan, and as the rollers drum against the roof and doors, Vaughan drives his pelvis upwards, almost lifting his buttocks off the seat. In the mounting roar of the rollers, she and Vaughan rock together, Vaughan holding her breasts together with his p as if trying to force them into a single globe. When his  hands move away to her buttocks, James can see that her  breasts have been bruised by Vaughan's fingers, the marks forming a pattern like crash injuries. At just this moment, Catherine looks into James's eyes in instant of complete lucidity. Her expression shows both i and affection, an acceptance of a sexual logic they both  recognize and have prepared themselves for. James sits quietly in the front seat as the white soap sl across the roof and doors like liquid lace. Catherine cri out, a gasp of pain cut off by Vaughan's strong hand acro her mouth.

An extension on the floor mounted gear lever rises laterally, giving way to a verti wing of chromium metal moulded into the reverse of a driv palm. Amid this small forest of machinery, James explores  Gabrielle's new and strange body, feeling his way among t braces and straps of her underwear, the unfamiliar planes her hips and legs, the unique culs-de-sac, odd declension of skin and musculature. Gabrielle lies back. She lifts her left foot so that the brace rests against his knee. In the inner surface of her thigh the straps form marked depressions, troughs of redd skin hollowed out in the forms of buckles and clasps. Jam unshackles the left leg brace and runs his fingers along hot, corrugated skin of the deep buckle groove. The exposed portions of her body are joined together by t loosened braces and straps.

His face is fixed in a rigid mask as he cuts in and out o the traffic lanes, surging ahead in the fast lane until h is abreast of them and then sliding back behind them, all other cars to cut between them and then taking up a watch position in the slow lane. James can see that Vaughan's car has become even more bat than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a re window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached f the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touc the ground as Vaughan corners. When they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes move. He pulls up beside them and then cuts viciously acr three lanes of traffic to hit them broadside. The nose of the Lincoln just nicks the tail of the light sports car,  which spins down the road. The Lincoln keeps on going, its vast momentum taking it i the guard rails of the exit ramp, and then over them. Catherine and James slam spinning into the tail of a tank which has all but stopped. The traffic behind them has al been slowing and thus easily avoids hitting the sports ca when it comes bouncing to a halt across two traffic lanes Catherine lies back, sprawled in her seat, eyes wide and  staring with fright, body rigid, bleeding from a small cu on her cheekbone. James jumps out of the car, then immedi slows with a limp. He continues, working his way doggedly through the motionless cars to the edge of the ramp. When he looks over the edge, James sees that Vaughan's Li has plunged into the top of an airline coach which was ru on the roadway below.

99) 0) text: We pull back to see James alone in the car. The road is  crowded and manic; James is intense, hard, exhilarated, a a hunter. The car is full of junk, pop cans, styrofoam  containers, all suggesting that he has basically been liv in the car for some time. James is searching for something among the lanes of traff threading the immense car in and out of the shifting hole that appear and disappear, driving with a fluid recklessn that is recognizably Vaughan's style. Suddenly, James becomes tense, focused: he has spotted wh he has been looking for.
101) 0) text: In her mirrors, Catherine spots the Lincoln charging towa her along the emergency lane. Her demeanor is just as  predatory as James's, and she does not hesitate to react. Catherine cranks the steering wheel to the right and dive across two lanes of startled vehicles to fishtail down a  little-used utility access road. Behind her, and closing rapidly, the lumbering Lincoln fo suit.
102) 0) text: Around the decreasing-radius curve of the utility road, t more nimble sports car stretches out the distance between and the Lincoln, but once the road uncurls, the booming V allows the American car to gobble up the ground until it nose to tail with Catherine's car. James begins to bump the tail of the sports car, breaking off the accelerator for a beat to let the white car -- wh looks especially fragile and delicate by comparison -- ge away a bit, then charging back until it makes contact. Now the road ahead curves again, and just as Catherine en the curve, James gives her a seriously violent jolt. The  rear of her car slews off on to the grass verge, almost c back, then loses traction completely. Catherine's car spins backwards off the road, then rolls  unceremoniously, almost gently, down a small grade, shedd bits and pieces, until it finally flops to a halt on its  side in front of a cement culvert.

104) 0) text: James jumps out of the car and stands for a beat at the e of the road on the wet grass, savoring the tableau below  him. Catherine lies sprawled, half out of the car, her tight b dress hiked up over her hips, one arm across her face as  though shielding her eyes from the sight of her ruined,  lightly smoking sports car. James eagerly makes his way down the wet grass of the hil toward Catherine. As he approaches her, she begins to mov stretching her arms behind her head, as though awakening  from a deep sleep. He can now see that her dress is wet,  soaked by the dirty water trickling out of the culvert an now dammed up by her torso. James kneels close to Catherine.
104) 1) dialog: Catherine. Are you all right? Are  you hurt?
104) 4) text: James slips her panties down her legs, leaving them aroun her left ankle when they snag on the one high-heeled shoe she still has on. He gently rotates her on to her right h undoes his fly, then lies down on the concrete with her,  ignoring the light, muddy stream which now begins to soak the thigh of his trousers. Kissing the back of her neck, enters her from behind.
