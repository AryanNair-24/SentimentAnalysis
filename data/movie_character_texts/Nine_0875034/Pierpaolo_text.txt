There are set models everywhere, in the process of being constructed, or painted. JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving. As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to look. PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a partitioned office -

Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesn't exist. Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests for Guido...

105) 20) text: Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her. As the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for Guido. She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches Claudia. Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.

136) 3) dialog: Maestro, should I call final checks?
136) 5) dialog: Makeup, please! Final checks! A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A part of him now and forever. Guido sits on the crane. The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet distance, she watches her husband return to his gift. Pierpaolo calls for silence.
