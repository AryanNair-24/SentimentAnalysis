0) 1) dialog: You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive.
0) 3) dialog: Finally, a serious question. Laughter.   A word:
1) 2) text: Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping over to the crane. Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in every sense a jumble of ideas. Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands, overwhelmed.
1) 4) dialog: Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini... How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page 1... Page nothing... In the distance, a figure approaches out of the darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An escape from his tortured reality. The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face, and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of GUIDO'S FANTASY. As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from his films, women he has loved, the sources of his inspiration and creative genius. A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own powerful entrance: LUISA, his wife CARLA, his mistress LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist SARAGHINA, a whore p. 3
1) 5) text: A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace.
2) 0) text: The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE, as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks, discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well- fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious punctuation:
2) 2) dialog: Buongiorno, Dante.
2) 4) dialog: Bene, grazie, bene. Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.
2) 11) dialog: We all have questions for Signor Contini. They head outside.
3) 0) text: Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.
3) 2) dialog: Is he going to follow us?
4) 0) text: A long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without missing a beat of their solemn conversation. p. 5
4) 1) text: As they progress into and through the open plan office, many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to get Guido's attention, swelling the procession, interjecting with their urgent requests. There are set models everywhere, in the process of being constructed, or painted. JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving. As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to look. PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a partitioned office -
4) 3) dialog: On my desk.
4) 5) dialog: Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so.
4) 7) dialog: (to Pierpaolo) Get me a cigarette.
4) 9) dialog: Jaconelli -
4) 11) dialog: (continues) Ascolta me.
4) 13) dialog: (he kisses Jaconelli on the cheek)
4) 14) text: Careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank. Guido carries on moving through the office.
5) 0) text: Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage. They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric.
5) 1) dialog: I need a cigarette. Dante comes in, closing the door behind him. p. 7
5) 3) dialog: I need a coffee and a cigarette. He lies down.
5) 5) dialog: Actually and an aspirin. Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some drawings.
5) 9) text: Calm down. Directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it. You just have to say yes or no. What else do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no - that's directing. Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.
5) 10) dialog: That's right: that's directing. And it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is...
5) 12) dialog: Yes. p. 8
5) 15) dialog: Yes, yes. (downs the espresso) Soon. Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.
5) 19) dialog: No.
5) 21) dialog: Yes. She ties Guido's tie for him.
5) 23) dialog: No. Nobody. Dante.    And his spy.
5) 25) dialog: (looking around, desperate)
6) 0) text: Guido is driving his Roadster   through the streets of Rome. An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the radio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo. In front of him in the convoy is   Dante with Fausto.
7) 0) text: As Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is extraordinary.
7) 1) dialog: What the hell's wrong with me? I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I'll come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I could visit you every week. Don't look at me like that.
8) 2) dialog: (buoyed by her encouragement)
9) 0) text: The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto. As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at him. Guido moves quickly by them. Dante and the team hurry after him.   Fausto tackles Dante. And they hurry after Guido.
10) 7) dialog: Thanks for coming, everybody. Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and kisses Dante on the cheek. He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their questions at once. The questions come on top of each other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.
10) 9) dialog: Yes.
10) 11) dialog: Actually, it's my shortest title yet.
10) 13) dialog: Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles.
10) 15) dialog: Why? I still don't know what my last film was about.
10) 18) dialog: Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press. General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps in.
10) 21) dialog: It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to see it. He's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes from American Vogue.   Flirtatious and charming, she wants him and he senses it. p. 13
10) 23) dialog: Stephanie.
10) 25) dialog: I'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it.
10) 28) dialog: For good?

The hotel has a slightly faded glamour, something that lifts it a little out of time. Guido's women are gone as the song ends. SUPERTITLE: Bellavista Spa Hotel, Anzio, Italy
28) 0) text: Guido enters like a thief. He doesn't want to be recognised. He approaches the Front Desk, where an immaculate Desk Clerk, the urbane and wise DE ROSSI, waits to greet him.
28) 1) dialog: I need a room.
28) 3) dialog: A suite.
28) 5) dialog: With a view of the sea. A balcony. Something with air.
28) 7) dialog: I've come from Milano.
28) 9) dialog: On business.    I'm a businessman. Busy busy busy.
28) 11) dialog: (doleful) Please.
28) 13) dialog: Why not.
28) 15) dialog: Not the flops. (anxious, confidential) I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet...? I'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible.
28) 17) dialog: (takes the key) And I need to place a call.   To my wife. Guido writes the number on a piece of paper on the desk.

30) 5) dialog: I had to escape from the Press Conference.

30) 17) dialog: I don't know, some spa.   Horrible.   I just kept driving.

41) 0) text: And out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her, pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She wears it with pride.
41) 2) dialog: (to himself, remembering how much work she is)
41) 6) dialog: Carlissima. She gives him a hug and a kiss, both too much for him in public.

43) 10) dialog: Get your makeup. Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it exactly as he wants it.

43) 36) dialog: Come here.
43) 38) dialog: What?
43) 40) dialog: Carla, just come here. (indicating her sheet) Be savage. Show me. She crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide.

She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his hair. He starts to sign - "TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... " then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself. Claudia laughs.

The other characters, with the exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre tableau. Luisa contemplates her life with Guido.
70) 42) text: Luisa's screen test for Guido. A work print in scratched black and white. The music continues.
70) 44) dialog: Your name, it's Italian.
70) 46) dialog: What have you done before?
70) 48) dialog: Waited? For this?
70) 50) text: Guido enters.   He's fascinated by her. She's taken aback that he's in front of the camera and approaching her. He walks straight up to her and unties her hair. It's oddly intimate. He stands back to reappraise her.
70) 51) dialog: Thank you.
70) 53) dialog: Thank you. For what I'm looking at. (walking away) Keep running.

73) 1) dialog: Luisa!
73) 3) dialog: Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened?
73) 5) dialog: What lie?
74) 0) text: Guido comes back inside. Carla is seated at a table. She sees him and calls for him.
75) 0) text: Guido pulls Carla through the lobby. She's humiliated.
75) 2) dialog: There are plenty of restaurants. p. 56
75) 4) dialog: Well you certainly managed to.
75) 6) dialog: I didn't know she was here.   She just turned up.
75) 8) dialog: The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me. He walks over to the front desk, to the ubiquitous De Rossi.
75) 9) dialog: A taxi, please, for the Signora.
75) 11) dialog: Carla, you have to wait outside.
75) 13) dialog: I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues.
75) 15) dialog: (shamed) I'll find someone to escort you home. He disappears. Carla walks towards the door, conscious of De Rossi. She's humiliated. De Rossi comes out from behind his desk, approaches her. p. 57
77) 0) text: Guido enters. The two single beds. Luisa is apparently asleep in hers. Guido sits on his bed. Glum.
77) 1) dialog: Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station. Luisa doesn't move.
77) 2) dialog: Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she would be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? Think about it. I didn't even know you were coming.
77) 4) dialog: Because it's true. Luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed.
77) 6) dialog: It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin. Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly. p. 58
77) 7) dialog: (smiles, insecure) What? What are you laughing about?
77) 10) dialog: It's finished. It's finished. (and he is exhausted) If it wasn't before, it is now.

78) 9) dialog: (paying) Please.
78) 11) dialog: Prego.
78) 13) dialog: (lights their cigarettes) Really?
78) 15) dialog: And what truth is that?
78) 17) dialog: I don't think religion is dead. And what exactly is the sexual revolution?

91) 0) text: ...Guido enters his own suite. He sits down on Luisa's bed, curls round her and kisses her neck. Determined to commit to Luisa.
91) 1) dialog: I love you Luisa. After a moment she turns to him, her own hand seeks his.
91) 2) dialog: Can we please try to be close again. The PHONE RINGS, shockingly loud. He kisses Luisa, then grabs the phone to silence it.
91) 3) dialog: Pronto...
92) 0) text: Guido arrives at the Pensione.   The Matron is waiting at the door. Distressed.
93) 1) dialog: Is the doctor still with her? The Matron nods.

97) 4) dialog: Carla, I should call your husband.
97) 6) dialog: What have you done to yourself?    I'm not worth dying for, Carla.
97) 9) dialog: Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning... He stands and pulls a sheet up over her. p. 67

101) 0) text: Guido wakes. It's morning. Carla looks very fragile as the first rays of sun touch the room. Him, too. He rubs his face, hears voices. He gets up, goes out to investigate.
102) 1) text: Guido straightens himself up, approaches, as Matron retreats to leave them alone. LUIGI is a nice, dignified man. He's very anxious. He and Guido can't really look at each other.
102) 4) dialog: Yes.
102) 6) dialog: Of course. I'm sorry. (hapless) She loves you, you know that, don't you.
103) 0) text: The door is open as Guido enters. He's confused, worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a closet.

103) 3) dialog: (anxious) Where's Luisa?

104) 1) dialog: I need more time.
105) 0) text: The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic, people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work, everybody and everything needing Guido's attention. Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesn't exist. Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests for Guido...
105) 7) dialog: (knows what that means)
105) 10) text: A couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS. The gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew, then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio telephone behind the flats. He dials. Guido waits. Luisa picks up the phone.
105) 12) dialog: Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up. (she doesn't respond) I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything...
105) 14) dialog: Otherwise I won't be able to start, I won't know what I'm thinking... Luisa listens. Pierpaolo appears again, always the same, needs him to start.
105) 16) dialog: Are you there? Luisa?
105) 18) dialog: I'm not asking you to let me come home, I just want you to come to the screen test tonight. Not for me, but for the movie. You always have, you always do. Luisa puts down the phone. p. 73
105) 19) text: Guido is in a mess.
105) 20) text: Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her. As the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for Guido. She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches Claudia. Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.
105) 22) dialog: Could you turn to the right please, Claudia.
105) 24) dialog: And can you turn to the left.
105) 26) dialog: Now just one slow turn for us.
105) 28) dialog: Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut.
105) 37) dialog: That's fair.
105) 39) dialog: (to Dante) That's fair.
105) 41) dialog: I'll be back. p. 75
105) 42) text: Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape.
105) 44) dialog: I'll be right back.
106) 0) text: Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car, flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a picture of the Star driving away with her Director. Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas and little cars.
107) 0) text: Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse following.   Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her in the car, she's such a class act. He's always inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.
107) 1) dialog: You look ravishing.
108) 0) text: Guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the Trastevere, just south of the Vatican. They watch the photographers hurtle past in search of them. They sit for a second. p. 76
108) 1) dialog: It's good to see you.
108) 3) dialog: Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script? Claudia listens. She's always seduced by the way he speaks, his passion. They fall in love with each other in every movie, that's the way of it. Guido lights a cigarette.
108) 4) dialog: Talk to the people who love you in our films, they're not interested in my script! They're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon... the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera - how?! - (enough examples, sighs) who even knows, but whatever else it is, it's not my script. Guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore. They get out of the car and begin to walk away.    It's almost deserted here.
108) 6) dialog: Not a million - you're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today, a country run by men - who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not.
108) 8) dialog: (trying hard to tell the truth)
108) 11) dialog: In a way - yes - you have this man in the story and he's, he wants to take hold of everything, to devour everything, he can't let anything go, or, he doesn't want to, and he changes direction every day, because he's lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to death...
108) 14) dialog: Exactly!   They fall in love with him.
108) 17) dialog: What?
110) 2) dialog: No, you misunderstand... p. 78
112) 1) dialog: She's his inspiration.
112) 3) dialog: I fall in love with you every time.
112) 5) dialog: No.
113) 1) dialog: There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about... Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain.
113) 2) dialog: ...and, all through the night, I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened.
113) 4) dialog: I don't know. I don't know.
115) 0) text: Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves closer to Guido. The music continues.
116) 0) text: A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically. Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up.
116) 12) text: During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out, as the women appear. They come on, one after the other, say their names. Guido gives them things to do.   Pick up the phone and argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him want you.   Walk towards the camera as if you were frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very angry on the phone:
116) 30) dialog: Sure.
116) 32) dialog: It meant so much to us all.    That you came.
116) 34) dialog: (nothing from Luisa)
118) 2) dialog: (encouraged)
120) 1) dialog: (dawning on him) What are you talking about? He stands up, leans on the chair back.
120) 2) dialog: The screen test? You have to understand, it's nothing, this is what I do, I direct. That's my job. Guido stands up straight.
121) 0) text: As the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes her body and her contempt for Guido. Guido watches, humiliated.
122) 3) dialog: What have I done? What have I done, Luisa?
123) 1) dialog: 
123) 8) dialog: 
123) 17) dialog: 
123) 45) dialog: (honest) I destroyed everything, Mamma... Suddenly, his mother appears.
123) 46) dialog: ...I destroyed everything, I just... you make one wrong turn and then because of that, after it all the turns are wrong. And you are so far from where you wanted to be...and you're lost and then you're lost. p. 87
124) 2) dialog: Old friends, I have to come clean with you.
125) 0) text: REALITY. Guido faces his production team.      This is hard for him.
125) 1) dialog: There is no movie. I can't pretend anymore. We have to stop. (nothing more to say) I'm sorry. There is silence in the room.
126) 0) text: The metal soundstage door opens as Guido and Dante walk through and into the sunlight. Guido is defeated. He stops at his car and turns to Dante. Guido gets in his car. Guido drives away. Dante watches him go.
127) 0) text: A cold wind blows.   A lonely figure (GUIDO) walks along a deserted beach. SUPERTITLE:   Anguillara, Italy, 2 years later p. 88
128) 0) text: It's the end of the season. Only a few customers left in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day, pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables. Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt. Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper, folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant. He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes -
129) 0) text: Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play, DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI. Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie. Guido watches from a distance. Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross and head down the street.
130) 0) text: Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront.   People pass by occasionally. They talk -
130) 2) dialog: She seemed so happy. I didn't want to interfere... Is she with anybody?
130) 4) dialog: I like to get about without everybody pointing at me.
130) 6) dialog: Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk.
130) 8) dialog: No, no. Nobody.
130) 11) dialog: Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is -
130) 13) dialog: I just miss her. I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead.
130) 15) dialog: (grasping at this)
130) 18) dialog: No. Never. I've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up. p. 90
130) 21) dialog: (doubtful) The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife.
131) 0) text: A surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores, models, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to begin. The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and builds throughout. People run past with props, lights, etc.    Showgirls are hurrying. A beautiful confusion. p. 91
132) 0) text: Guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence. Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge his support. Pierpaolo is tender.
132) 1) dialog: I can't remember how you do this.
134) 0) text: Guido is in his element again, locked in passionate discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand, an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest; a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets. The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a woman.
134) 1) dialog: I don't want to say too much. The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it. But this scene is about reconciliation. And within the scene I would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other.

136) 0) text: From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido watches Older Guido at work.
136) 1) dialog: (Continuing to speak to his actors)
136) 2) text: Maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again... We start from the beginning each time and I feel today as if I'm starting from the beginning. We'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay? On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white. But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set in front of him.
136) 4) dialog: Yes.
136) 10) dialog:
