5) 0) text: Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage. They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric.
5) 4) dialog: (unimpressed) Answer a question, I'll give you a coffee. Answer another question, I'll give you a cigarette. And so on.
5) 8) dialog: (turns to Guido and lights a cigarette)
5) 9) text: Calm down. Directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it. You just have to say yes or no. What else do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no - that's directing. Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.

49) 23) text: As Dante takes over, Guido walks away, heads towards Lilli and her domain.
50) 3) dialog: I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit. Lilli is working at a mannequin, hand-sewing some sequins on a costume. A red feathered boa is draped on the figure.
50) 4) dialog: It was Luisa's birthday yesterday.
50) 6) dialog: What's that? Guido sees the costume.
50) 8) dialog: It's for Claudia.
50) 10) dialog: Well I don't know which scene until I`ve seen the script, but she always likes something like this, or you do.
50) 12) dialog: Don't knock the Folies Bergere... Lilli tosses the boa over her shoulder as she continues pinning the costume.
50) 13) dialog: ...it brings back happy memories. That's where I learned my art. All those sequins, all those feathers. (Still working) And, you're wrong, you put Claudia in one of these for that nightclub scene in Natura Morta.
50) 15) dialog: Oh Guido, don't. That's death.     Every time we have to start again.
50) 17) dialog: You won't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass.
50) 20) dialog: Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream up something entertaining, Guido? Something with music...with dancing... God knows, we could use a little joie de vivre around here... Guido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her and sees... p. 38
51) 0) text: ...Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red feathered boa hangs from her shoulders. She places the same straw hat on her head. The soundstage has been transformed into an impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the 1930's, with Lilli as its French Star. A spotlight finds Guido watching from the scaffolding of his unfinished set. The din of the theater audience fills the smoky atmosphere.
51) 1) dialog: (singing and performing in a french accent)
51) 14) dialog: 
51) 42) dialog: Ah, Bon soir, bon soir, bon soir. Je suis la vedette des Folies Bergere. Vedette, it means 'star.' Lilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage:
51) 43) dialog: Let me tell you. Last night I looked down at this table in the chairs you are sitting in now, and what did I see? A priest! And next to him? Suddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience.
51) 44) dialog: Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini? What are you doing here at the Folies Bergere? You naughty boy! You're only nine years old! But I'm glad you've come. Would you like to join me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come, come. And she brings him onto the stage. The audience applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older Guido.
51) 45) dialog: Feeling better? There's no room for hopelessness in here, is there, Guido? (to the audience) We must explain something to our young Guido. What do we want? Laughter! What do we want? Love! What do we want? Dreams! Let us not forget, Guido, mon cher -- That's our privilege - to entertain. p. 40

69) 24) dialog: (confidentially) You're saving the movie. Give him a good idea, for God's sake. Luisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are kisses, etc. as Guido returns and pops open the bottle of champagne.
69) 39) dialog: That I would pay to see.
69) 41) dialog: She was the best thing in the movie.
105) 6) dialog: Claudia says where are you? She's in fine form. Feisty.
105) 9) dialog: She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one. I said I didn't quite have mine. Lilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a rack of costumes. p. 72
105) 20) text: Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her. As the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for Guido. She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches Claudia. Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.

130) 5) dialog: And where are you getting about?
130) 7) dialog: Are you seeing anybody?
130) 9) dialog: (teasing)
130) 12) dialog: - I know.
130) 14) dialog: Luisa certainly thinks so.
130) 17) dialog: Stop! I'm not going to act as a postman between you both. Come back to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work. He sits.   Lilli joins him.
130) 19) dialog: You're such a dope, aren't you? Making movies wasn't your problem. You were your problem.   Don't stop being a child. You'll never make another movie! Nobody wants that... especially Luisa. She indicates the people who pass.
130) 20) dialog: Guido - there probably isn't a single person passing by who hasn't been touched in some way by one of your movies. That's your gift. That's what you've been given. Use it. Just use it with some grace. For Chrissake.
130) 22) dialog: Sounds perfect. (after a beat) The costumes might not be so bad too. FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a female eye applying false eyelashes.
