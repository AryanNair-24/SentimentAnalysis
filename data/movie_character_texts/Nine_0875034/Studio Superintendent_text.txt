1) 1) dialog: Good luck, Maestro. Departing, he closes the soundstage door. As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard. GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the world. In front of him: AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under construction.

A lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands. p. 2
